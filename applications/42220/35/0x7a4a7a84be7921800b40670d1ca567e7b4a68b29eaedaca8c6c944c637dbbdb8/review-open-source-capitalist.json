  "review": "The Green Ambassadors Club's application presents a well-rounded initiative addressing multiple community needs on Kimi Island, Uganda. The project aligns with the round's focus on grassroots nature stewardship and uses Hypercerts for impact verification, as required. The application effectively demonstrates community involvement and provides data-backed proof of impact, meeting the eligibility criteria. However, the application could benefit from a clearer articulation of its long-term systemic impact and scalability potential, as emphasized in the model specification. Additionally, while the project addresses immediate community needs, it should further highlight its innovative approaches and potential for broader, scalable impact.",
