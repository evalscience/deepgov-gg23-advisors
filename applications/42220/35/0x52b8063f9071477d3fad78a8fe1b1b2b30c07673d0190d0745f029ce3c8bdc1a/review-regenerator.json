  "summary": "The \"Bees & Trees Uganda\" project aims to address environmental degradation in Uganda by integrating trees into farming practices. This initiative, led by a youth-driven social enterprise, provides beehives and coffee seedlings to farmers, encouraging them to plant trees that aid in land restoration and biodiversity enhancement. The project also supports farmers economically through honey and coffee sales, while promoting agroforestry practices. The project aligns with the round's focus on ecosystem restoration, community involvement, and measurable impact verification through Hypercerts.",
  "review": "The \"Bees & Trees Uganda\" project presents a compelling case for funding under the \"Hypercerts for Nature Stewards\" round. The project effectively addresses the round's eligibility criteria by demonstrating measurable restoration efforts, community involvement, and the use of Hypercerts for impact verification. The initiative's focus on agroforestry and economic incentives for farmers aligns with the constitutional principles of environmental sustainability and community participation. However, the application lacks detailed data-backed proof of impact and a clear plan for long-term stewardship, which are critical for assessing the project's scalability and sustainability.",
