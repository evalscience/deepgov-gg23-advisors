Fearing trees as space-hungry competitors, they cut them down to grow food. This led to biodiversity loss, soil erosion, and deadly floods and landslides, claiming over 1,000 lives.\n\n### üìú Our Solution\nTo address this, Bees and Trees, a youth-led social enterprise has motivated smallholder farmers in Uganda to restore degraded land through incentives. They gifted beehives and coffee seedlings to the farmers. This motivated them to plant 734 coffee shade trees and bee forage species, integrating trees into their farms. The trees are contributing to land and habitat restoration, mitigating climate change and landslides. \nFurthermore, honey and coffee sales are providing additional income to the farmers, while the bees are enhancing food production and biodiversity through pollination. The social enterprise is also purchasing coffee grown under agroforestry at premium prices, further motivating farmers to integrate and preserve trees on their farms.
