  "summary": "The \"Bees & Trees Uganda\" project aims to address environmental degradation in Uganda by integrating trees into farming practices. The project provides beehives and coffee seedlings to farmers, encouraging them to plant trees that contribute to land restoration and biodiversity. The initiative also offers economic benefits through honey and coffee sales, promoting sustainable agroforestry practices.",
  "review": "The \"Bees & Trees Uganda\" project presents a compelling case for environmental restoration and community empowerment. The project aligns well with the round's focus on grassroots nature stewardship, using Hypercerts for impact verification. The initiative demonstrates measurable outcomes, such as the planting of 734 trees, and provides data-backed proof of impact through videos and maps. The project also emphasizes community involvement and offers economic incentives to farmers, which supports long-term sustainability. However, the application lacks detailed information on governance structures and the scalability of the project. Additionally, while the project shows promise in environmental and economic sustainability, it could benefit from a more detailed plan for reducing dependency on continuous donations.",
