            "description": "Bees and Trees motivates smallholder farmers in Uganda to restore degraded land through incentives. They gift beehives and coffee seedlings to farmers. This motivates the farmers to plant coffee shade trees and bee forage species, integrating trees into their farms. So far, 734 trees have been planted and marked on the GainForest Green Globe. The trees contribute to land and habitat restoration, mitigate climate change and prevent landslides. At the same time honey and coffee sales provide additional income to the farmers; while the bees enhance food production and biodiversity through pollination.The social enterprise also purchases coffee grown under agroforestry at premium prices, further motivating farmers to integrate and preserve trees on their farms."
