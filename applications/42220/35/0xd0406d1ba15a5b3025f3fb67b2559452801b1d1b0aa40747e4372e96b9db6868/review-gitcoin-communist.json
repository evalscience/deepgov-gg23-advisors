  "summary": "Project Mocha aims to empower smallholder coffee farmers in Kenya by leveraging blockchain technology to tokenize coffee trees and beans, providing farmers with access to on-chain liquidity for farm rehabilitation and productivity investments. The project addresses systemic challenges faced by these farmers, such as lack of access to fair markets and financial resources, and aims to boost productivity and sustainability through innovative technology and agroforestry practices.",
  "review": "Project Mocha presents a compelling case for addressing the systemic challenges faced by smallholder coffee farmers in Kenya. The application highlights the significant gap between the potential and actual productivity of coffee trees, emphasizing the need for financial inclusion and modern agricultural practices. By leveraging blockchain technology, the project aims to provide transparency, traceability, and fair pricing, which are crucial for empowering farmers and ensuring sustainable practices. The use of IoT sensors and geo-tagging for productivity tracking is a strong point, as it aligns with the round's requirement for data-backed proof of impact. However, the application lacks detailed information on the project's governance structure and how it plans to ensure equitable distribution of benefits among the farmers. Additionally, while the project mentions collaboration with various experts, it does not provide specific details on the roles and contributions of these collaborators. The project's focus on environmental sustainability and community involvement is commendable, but more information on the long-term sustainability of the financial model would strengthen the application.",
