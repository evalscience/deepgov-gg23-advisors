  "summary": "Project Mocha aims to revolutionize coffee farming in Kenya by using blockchain technology to tokenize coffee trees and beans, providing farmers with access to on-chain liquidity for farm rehabilitation and productivity investments. The project addresses systemic challenges faced by smallholder coffee farmers, such as lack of access to fair markets and financial resources, by ensuring transparency, traceability, and fair pricing. The initiative also incorporates agroforestry practices to enhance biodiversity and carbon sequestration, aiming to boost productivity and create a sustainable financial ecosystem.",
  "review": "Project Mocha presents a compelling solution to the challenges faced by smallholder coffee farmers in Kenya. By leveraging blockchain technology, the project aims to provide farmers with access to financial resources, thereby enabling them to invest in critical inputs and modern practices. The use of geo-tagging and IoT sensors for productivity tracking ensures transparency and traceability, which are crucial for fair pricing and market access. The project's focus on agroforestry practices aligns with the round's emphasis on restoration and community involvement. However, the application lacks detailed information on the project's scalability and long-term sustainability, which are critical for maximizing impact. Additionally, while the project provides data-backed proof of impact, it does not clearly outline how it plans to measure and report its impact over time. Overall, Project Mocha aligns well with the round's goals but could benefit from a more detailed plan for scalability and impact measurement.",
