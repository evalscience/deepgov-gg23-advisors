  "review": "The Fork Forest project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's objectives of ecosystem restoration and community involvement. The project aims to plant 1,200 trees to create a forest barrier, addressing the agrochemical impact in Los Cerrillos, Córdoba. This initiative not only focuses on environmental restoration but also involves the local community through educational workshops and cultural activities, enhancing social cohesion. The use of Hypercerts for impact verification and the project's presence on Ecocertain.xyz demonstrate a commitment to transparency and accountability, meeting the round's requirements. However, the application lacks detailed information on the project's scalability and long-term sustainability, which are crucial for maximizing impact as per the model specification. Additionally, while the project has a strong local focus, it could benefit from outlining how it plans to achieve broader, scalable impact beyond the immediate community.",
