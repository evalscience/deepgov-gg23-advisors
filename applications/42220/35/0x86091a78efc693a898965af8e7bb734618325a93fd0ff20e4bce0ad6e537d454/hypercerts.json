Its objective is to mitigate the impact of agrochemicals derived from intensive farming, improving the quality of life of the town's 1,200 inhabitants. The active participation of young people, teachers, authorities, and artists has been key in the design, planting of 600 trees, installation of drip irrigation, and maintenance of the area, complemented by educational workshops, community murals, and cultural activities to strengthen the social fabric.\nThis intervention, located on the agricultural edge of the town, has successfully mobilized 150 people and offers long-term ecological, health, and social benefits. Its results include progress toward a community ordinance formalizing the project, the restoration of the area's landscape, and the promotion of sustainable productive alternatives, such as agroecology and digital economy workshops with support from INTA (National Institute of Statistics and Census). The forest curtain not only protects health and restores biodiversity, but also strengthens community identity, promoting a replicable and low-cost model toward a more just and agroecological future."
