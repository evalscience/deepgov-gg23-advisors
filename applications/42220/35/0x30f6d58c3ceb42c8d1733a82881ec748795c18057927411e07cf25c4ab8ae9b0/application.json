        "description": "### **Project Description**\nThe **Kendir Hemp Cultivation project** is a regenerative farming initiative by **Earthist DAO**, aiming to restore soil health, biodiversity, and traditional agricultural knowledge in Türkiye. \nWe’ve been actively engaged in the **hemp ecosystem since 2017**—growing, cultivating, and processing hemp to support industry innovation and R&D. This experience, along with strong relationships and deep ecological knowledge, laid the foundation for this field-based initiative.\nIn 2024, we cultivated **41.6 decares** of heirloom hemp using ecological methods and heirloom seed varieties to regenerate degraded land, support local communities, create a sustainable value chain, and revive cultural practices.\n\n> \n---\n> \n### 🌍 The Challenge We’re Tackling\n\nSoil degradation has reached crisis levels, and our region is no exception. The decline of hemp (*kendir*)—once a keystone crop in Türkiye—has deepened this crisis. Hemp historically supported ecosystem health, rural livelihoods, and cultural practices through regenerative farming, but was pushed aside in favor of industrial systems reliant on extractive, polluting inputs like plastic, cotton, and fossil-based materials.\n\nYet hemp is one of the most **versatile and valuable crops on Earth**, capable of supporting a **broad range of industries** with sustainable alternatives. Its stalks, seeds, and fibers feed into **textiles, construction, food, cosmetics, bioplastics, paper, packaging**, and even biofuel—creating opportunities for **local circular economies** rooted in regeneration.\n\nWith deep roots that rebuild soil structure and a rapid growth cycle that sequesters carbon, hemp isn’t just a crop—it’s a **climate solution**. Reviving *kendir* means reconnecting to a forgotten value chain that supports ecology, economy, and community alike. It’s not just about growing hemp—it’s about catalyzing an entire **bioregional regenerative economy**\n\n---\n> \n### 📜 Our Solution\n\nIn April–September 2024, we launched a regenerative hemp cultivation cycle using:\n- **1.5 tons of organic manure per decare**\n- **Heirloom seeds** adapted to local soil and climate\n- **100+ beehives** integrated into the ecosystem\n- **No synthetic chemicals or deep tillage**\n\nWe produced:\n- **43 tons of hemp stalks**\n- **3,000+ kg of nutrient-rich seeds**\n- **Cannabis honey**, harvested from our pollinator-friendly ecosystem\n\nThe project empowered **15+ local workers**, passed on traditional farming knowledge, and laid the foundation for **community-based hemp processing and green jobs**.\n\n---\n> \n\n\n### 🌱 Our Organisations: Earthist DAO and Kendir Hemp\n\n**Earthist DAO** is a regenerative bioregional network using Web3 tools to coordinate and fund nature-positive, community-driven initiatives. We connect **farmers, ecologists, builders, and technologists** to co-create projects that restore ecosystems and regenerate local economies.\n\nOur work centers on **hemp as a keystone crop** for ecological and economic regeneration. The **Kendir Hemp initiative**, launched as one of Earthist DAO’s flagship regenerative ventures, demonstrates how traditional crops—when grown regeneratively—can restore ecosystems, empower communities, and activate circular value chains. Through education, open access, and transparent on-chain coordination, we aim to catalyze bioregional transformation from the soil up.\n\n---\n> \n\n\n\n### 🧾 What This Hypercert Represents\n\nThis Hypercert certifies the **full 2024 cultivation cycle** of heirloom *kendir* hemp by Earthist DAO—our first regenerative pilot in this region, carried out across **three separate land parcels**.\n> \n\n📍 **Location:** Türkiye (40°40'25.3\"N, 35°18'56.1\"E)  \n🗓️ **Timeline:** April–September 2024  \n🌿 **Impact:** 42 decares cultivated using regenerative methods; heirloom hemp revived; soil fertility improved; pollinator biodiversity enriched; and rural livelihoods supported.\n\n> \n\n\n\nWhile the season brought measurable outcomes, it also came with challenges—including limited infrastructure and lower-than-expected yields in **one of the three adjacent plots**. As a first-year pilot in this region, the project provided valuable insights that will guide future improvements.\n\nWe believe tools like **Hypercerts** and **data streams on Regen Network** will be key to growing this initiative with transparency, community alignment, and long-term regenerative value.  \nWe are committed to refining our practices each season and scaling impact with care.\n\n\n> \n🖼️ **Hypercert Image**  \n![Hypercert](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/_next/image?url=%2Fapi%2Fhypercert-image%2F42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-59889696578085169569553930907991205216256&w=640&q=75)\n\n🔗 **[View on Ecocertain](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/hypercert/42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-59889696578085169569553930907991205216256)**\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Proof That It’s Working\n\n📂 **Proof of Impact Folder**  \n[View on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xuAivZ34sDEkZwr2SLlPxJJXoc7Bniws)\n\n🗳️ **DAO Governance Records**  \n- [Proposal A12](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1vg9hpfyxn6dps0nx7v0064msgrrwakmjgf3dh7fa8ldzue6anxms964vct/proposals/A12)  \n- [Proposal A13](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1vg9hpfyxn6dps0nx7v0064msgrrwakmjgf3dh7fa8ldzue6anxms964vct/proposals/A13)\n\n\n\n### 💡 Join Us in Making a Difference!\n\nYour support helps scale regenerative farming, empower local farmers, and build a community-led bioeconomy.
