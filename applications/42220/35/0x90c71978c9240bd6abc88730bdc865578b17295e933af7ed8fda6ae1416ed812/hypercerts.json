Like many others this family had been dedicated to monocultures of cattle and pasture. Thanks to the will of the son, we were able to bring long term policulture and productive consortiums to the family's legacy.\n\nSince the first season the system has yielded 60 kg of beans, 120 kg of rice, 40 kg of corn, peanuts, cassava, sugar cane and over 150 syntropic nests (diverse pockets of forest species, banana rhizomes, Mexican sunflowers, and jackbeans), ensuring food security, a genetic bank of seeds and a dignifing future for the involved families.\n\nNow, we’re expanding. With your support, we’ll purchase native seedlings to enrich the agroforestry system, turning this land into a model of regeneration for other rural families."
