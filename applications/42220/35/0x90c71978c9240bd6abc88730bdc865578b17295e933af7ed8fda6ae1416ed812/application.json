Inheriting the natural legacy from past generations and having responsibilities for improving and passing this wealth to the next generations.\n\nIn the 90s the movement of Syntropic Farming brought back the possibility of cultivating food forests and creating natural inheritance, but it is still very much an individual effort oriented by market incentives, and not a collective effort mediated by community incentives. \n\nCommunity cares for the long term, for education, capacity building, for public goods, celebrations, experiences and friendships. Markets care about short term profits whatever it takes. \n\nNowadays, the lack of a community scafold has brought failure to many young families that tried to leave the city and start a rural life, and we often see couples breaking up for not being able to sustain their families with products sales, specially if they live in a small town far from any large urban center.
