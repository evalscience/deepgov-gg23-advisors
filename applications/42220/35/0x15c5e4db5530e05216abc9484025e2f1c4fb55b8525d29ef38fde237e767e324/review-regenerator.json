  "summary": "ReFi DAO is a pioneering initiative in the Regenerative Finance (ReFi) movement, leveraging Web3 technologies to foster ecological and social well-being. The project has demonstrated significant ecological impact through various initiatives, including tree planting, local node support, and the development of frameworks for evaluating ecological benefits. The application highlights a strong commitment to community involvement, innovation, and environmental sustainability, aligning well with the round's eligibility criteria and the model specification's principles.",
  "review": "The ReFi DAO application presents a compelling case for funding, showcasing a robust track record of ecological and social impact. The project aligns well with the round's focus on grassroots nature stewardship, using Hypercerts for impact verification and demonstrating measurable restoration efforts. The application emphasizes community involvement through local nodes and innovative approaches like the ReFi EBF and hypercerts for impact tracking. However, the application could benefit from more specific data-backed proof of impact tied to geographical locations, as required by the round's eligibility criteria. Additionally, while the project demonstrates a strong commitment to innovation and sustainability, further details on the long-term stewardship plans and community accountability mechanisms would strengthen the application.",
