  "summary": "ReFi DAO is a project focused on leveraging Web3 technologies to foster ecological and social well-being through regenerative finance. The application highlights various initiatives, including tree planting, ecological benefits frameworks, and local node support, aiming for global impact. The project aligns with the round's focus on restoration and community involvement but lacks specific geographical impact data and measurable outcomes.",
  "review": "The ReFi DAO application presents a compelling vision for leveraging Web3 technologies to drive ecological and social well-being. The project has demonstrated a commitment to tangible climate solutions through initiatives like ReFi Week and the ReFi EBF partnership. However, the application lacks specific geographical impact data and measurable outcomes, which are crucial for aligning with the round's requirements. The project does not clearly demonstrate its readiness to create and publish an Environmental Hypercert on Ecocertain.xyz, nor does it provide data-backed proof of impact tied to a specific location. While the project has a broad and ambitious scope, it needs to focus on providing concrete evidence of its impact and readiness to meet the round's specific requirements.",
