  "summary": "The Ecovillage Network Ukraine project aims to support ecological regeneration and community resilience in war-affected regions of Ukraine through collaborative land restoration initiatives. Coordinated by GEN Ukraine, the project involves 60+ rural ecovillages and engages residents, displaced families, eco-activists, and international allies to restore biodiversity, water systems, and landscape health across the country. The project emphasizes community involvement, with activities such as tree planting, water system regeneration, and grazing-based regeneration. The project has quantifiable results, including the planting of over 2000 trees and bushes, establishment of 5 water management systems, and involvement of over 300 people directly. The project aligns with the round's eligibility criteria, focusing on measurable restoration, long-term stewardship, and community involvement.",
  "review": "The Ecovillage Network Ukraine project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's eligibility criteria and the model specification's principles. The project demonstrates clear, measurable outcomes, such as the planting of over 2000 trees and the establishment of water management systems, which align with the Evidence and Measurement Principles. The project's focus on community involvement and ecological restoration supports the Governance and Equity Principles, promoting geographic equity and collective benefit. However, the application lacks detailed information on the project's sustainability model and long-term financial planning, which is crucial for aligning with the Sustainability Principles. Additionally, while the project demonstrates strong community involvement, more information on the governance structure and decision-making processes would strengthen its alignment with the Governance and Equity Principles. Overall, the project is a strong candidate for funding, but improvements in sustainability planning and governance transparency are recommended.",
