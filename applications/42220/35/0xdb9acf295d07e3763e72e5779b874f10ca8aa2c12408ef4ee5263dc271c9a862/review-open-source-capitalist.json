  "summary": "The Ecovillage Network Ukraine project aims to support ecological regeneration and community resilience in war-affected regions of Ukraine through collaborative land restoration initiatives. The project is coordinated by GEN Ukraine, a network of over 60 rural ecovillages, and involves residents, displaced families, eco-activists, and international allies. The project focuses on restoring biodiversity, water systems, and landscape health across diverse ecosystems in Ukraine. It emphasizes community involvement, with activities such as tree planting, water system regeneration, and grazing-based regeneration. The project has quantifiable results, including the planting of over 2000 trees and bushes, establishment of water management systems, and improved biodiversity.",
  "review": "The Ecovillage Network Ukraine project is a commendable initiative that aligns well with the round's focus on grassroots nature stewardship and ecosystem restoration. The project demonstrates strong community involvement, with a diverse range of participants including local residents, displaced families, and international volunteers. The project's activities, such as tree planting and water system regeneration, are well-documented and have quantifiable results, which is a significant strength. However, the application lacks detailed information on the project's long-term sustainability and scalability, which are crucial for maximizing impact. Additionally, while the project has a strong local focus, it could benefit from a clearer strategy for broader, scalable impact. The project should also provide more data-backed proof of impact to strengthen its application.",
