  "summary": "The Ecovillage Network Ukraine project aims to support ecological regeneration and community resilience in war-affected regions of Ukraine through collaborative land restoration initiatives. Coordinated by GEN Ukraine, a network of over 60 rural ecovillages, the project engages residents, displaced families, eco-activists, and international allies to restore biodiversity, water systems, and landscape health across diverse ecosystems in Ukraine. The project emphasizes community involvement, with activities such as tree planting, water system regeneration, and grazing-based regeneration, all aimed at improving biodiversity and ecosystem resilience.",
  "review": "The Ecovillage Network Ukraine project presents a compelling case for funding under the Hypercerts for Nature Stewards round. The project aligns well with the round's eligibility criteria, demonstrating measurable restoration efforts, long-term stewardship, and significant community involvement. The project spans 11 ecovillages across Ukraine, engaging a diverse group of stakeholders, including local residents, eco-activists, and international allies, in ecological restoration activities. The project's approach combines ecological restoration with community empowerment, focusing on activities such as tree planting, water system regeneration, and grazing-based regeneration. These efforts are supported by ecological education, community gatherings, and permaculture training, which build both human and ecosystem resilience. The project has achieved quantifiable results, including the planting of over 2000 trees and bushes, the establishment of five water management systems, and the restoration of four hectares of land. The project's emphasis on community involvement and ecological sustainability aligns with the constitutional principles and values outlined in the model specification. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the project's long-term sustainability and the specific roles of community members in decision-making processes.",
