        "description": "### 🌍 The Challenge We’re Tackling \nIn Kenya’s South Rift Valley, the degradation of grasslands is threatening pastoral livelihoods, wildlife habitats, and cultural heritage. As grass cover disappears, so does the food for livestock and wildlife, leading to increased conflict and vulnerability—especially for women who depend on the land for household sustenance. If we do nothing, we risk losing both biodiversity and traditional ways of life.\n\n### 📜 Our Solution \nWe are restoring degraded rangelands through a community-led grass seed bank. This 20-acre seedbank, managed by a local women’s group, not only rehabilitates the land but also generates income through the sale of native grass seeds and hay. It’s a nature-based solution that empowers women, supports livestock production, and protects critical ecosystems—all rooted in indigenous knowledge and community leadership.\n\n### 🌱 Our Organisation / Community \nWe are SORALO (South Rift Association of Land Owners), a land trust representing 16 Maasai communities working across over 2 million acres. Our work is guided by Enkop’ang (Our Land) and Erematare (Stewardship)—cultural principles that drive our mission to protect and restore this shared landscape for both people and wildlife.\n\n🖼️ See Our Impact\n\n🔗 [View our ecocert here](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/hypercert/42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-33687954325172907882874086135745052934144)\n\n![alt text](https://ecocertain.vercel.app/_next/image?url=%2Fapi%2Fhypercert-image%2F42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-33687954325172907882874086135745052934144&w=640&q=75)\n\n### 📝 What This Hypercert Represents \nThis hypercert represents the successful establishment of one 20-acre community grass seed bank.
