            "description": "SORALOâ€™s Women-Led Grass Seed Banks restore degraded rangelands while creating economic opportunities for Maasai women. At the Lenkobei site, one of four sites across 80 hectares, 20 women are actively involved in cultivating and harvesting native grasses to reseed overgrazed lands, revitalizing grazing areas, and strengthening ecosystem health. So far, the initiative has restored over 80 acres, ensuring sustainable pastoralism and wildlife coexistence. Beyond ecological impact, the seed banks generate income that supports families and funds school bursaries, fostering long-term community resilience. By combining restoration with economic empowerment, SORALO is securing a healthier future for both people and nature."
