The initiative supports two local community groups—**Orum** and **Abyecce**—to lead the planting and care of mangrove seedlings in ecologically vulnerable creek zones.\n\nThe project combines environmental restoration with livelihood creation by training and employing community members in mangrove nursery management, planting, and conservation education. In 2023, the program successfully planted **54,400 mangrove trees**, laying the foundation for long-term ecosystem recovery and sustainable economic opportunities.\n\nThe 2025 planting season will scale these efforts, improve seedling survival through enhanced nursery practices, and introduce monitoring systems to ensure ecological impact. The project empowers local communities as stewards of their environment, contributing to biodiversity conservation, climate resilience, and inclusive development.\n\n\n\n"
