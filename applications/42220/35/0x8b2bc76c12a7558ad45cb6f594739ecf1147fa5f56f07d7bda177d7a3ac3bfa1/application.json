        "description": "🌍 **The Challenge We’re Tackling**  \nIn Uganda, over 70% of healthcare facilities lack climate adaptation measures, leaving them vulnerable to climate-related disasters. Without action, the health and wellbeing of communities are increasingly at risk. The impacts of climate change—ranging from food insecurity to poor air quality—are already affecting public health.\n\n📜 **Our Solution**  \nClimatica Foundation launched a fruit tree-growing initiative across 30 healthcare facilities in Uganda. By planting trees, we’re improving food security, restoring degraded landscapes, and helping healthcare centers become more climate-resilient. This project strengthens the link between environmental health and public health.\n\n🌱 **About Us**  \nWe are Climatica Foundation, a Uganda-based organization working at the intersection of climate resilience and public health.
