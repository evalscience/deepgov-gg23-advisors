  "summary": "The Climatica Foundation's grant application focuses on addressing climate adaptation in healthcare facilities in Uganda by planting fruit trees and training healthcare workers. The project aims to improve food security, restore landscapes, and enhance climate resilience in 30 healthcare facilities. The application aligns with the round's focus on grassroots nature stewardship and uses Hypercerts for impact verification.",
  "review": "The Climatica Foundation's application presents a compelling case for funding, addressing a critical issue of climate adaptation in healthcare facilities in Uganda. The project aligns well with the round's eligibility criteria, focusing on ecosystem restoration and community involvement. The use of Hypercerts for impact verification and the provision of data-backed proof of impact strengthen the application. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the scalability of the project and how it plans to achieve long-term systemic change. Additionally, while the project has a clear local impact, it should emphasize how it aligns with the model specification's focus on maximizing total impact and long-term systemic change.",
