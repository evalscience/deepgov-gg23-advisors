In March-April 2024, Climatica Foundation planted 2,000 trees using agroforestry techniques on local farms. The initiative not only improved soil health, crop yields, and the microclimate but also trained 5 youth farmers in tree mapping technology, allowing them to monitor tree growth and track the planting sites using satellite data. The project is set to continue, with plans to plant 3,500 more trees along road reserves in Odwarat Subcounty."
