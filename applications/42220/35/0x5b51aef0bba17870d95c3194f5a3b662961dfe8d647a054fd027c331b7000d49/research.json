    "name": "Ginakev Farms",
    "objectives": [
      "Reverse the rapid decline of tree cover due to unstructured farming practices and removal of high-value tree species.",
      "Restore soil fertility, biodiversity, and long-term agricultural productivity.",
      "Integrate tree conservation with large-scale reforestation.",
      "Preserve mature cashew trees and expand cashew tree cultivation.",
      "Scale palm tree reforestation for structured agroforestry.",
      "Ensure long-term land conservation and security.",
      "Provide sustainable income for local farmers.",
      "Strengthen biodiversity and restore tree cover.",
      "Build ecological resilience through water access and pollination.",
      "Create long-term economic sustainability and climate resilience."
    ],
    "scope": "The project is focused on the Amalla Community, Obollo, Udenu LGA, Enugu State, Nigeria. It currently involves securing 100 plots (approximately 11.48 acres / 4.65 hectares) for conservation and regenerative agroforestry. The scope includes specific tree planting targets (82 new cashew trees, 643 palm trees in 2025, with a long-term vision of 5,000 palm trees across 800 plots) and foundational infrastructure development (geological survey, borehole, fencing, beekeeping). The project also aims for long-term land conservation and securing a Certificate of Occupancy.",
    "problem_statement": "Across many rural communities, tree cover is rapidly declining due to unstructured farming practices and the removal of high-value tree species. This negatively impacts soil fertility, biodiversity, and long-term agricultural productivity, reducing the economic potential of trees like palm and cashew. Specifically, in Amalla Community, Udenu LGA, Enugu State, Nigeria, this trend needs to be reversed."

  "technical_analysis": {
    "methodology": "The technical approach integrates tree conservation with large-scale reforestation and sustainable agroforestry. Key methods include: securing land (100 plots), protecting existing mature cashew trees, planting new cashew trees, and planning extensive palm tree reforestation. Foundational infrastructure development is a core part of the methodology, including geological surveys for water, borehole drilling for irrigation and community needs, perimeter fencing for security, and beekeeping for pollination. The project also emphasizes land conservation and securing a Certificate of Occupancy for long-term management.",
    "innovation": "The project's innovative aspects lie in its integration of traditional regenerative agroforestry practices with modern Web3 and ReFi (Regenerative Finance) technologies. The use of Hypercerts for verifiable impact reporting and Gainforest for mapping proof of impact represents a novel approach to transparency and accountability in environmental restoration projects. This 'climate-positive approach' aims to create a scalable model for ecosystem restoration and sustainable livelihoods.",
    "feasibility": "The project's technical feasibility appears high, given the detailed plans for tree planting (specific numbers and plot allocations), and the clear outline for foundational infrastructure (geological survey, borehole, fencing, beehives). The methodology is well-defined and relies on established agroforestry practices. The use of Web3 tools for verification adds a layer of transparency and accountability, enhancing feasibility for impact reporting.",
