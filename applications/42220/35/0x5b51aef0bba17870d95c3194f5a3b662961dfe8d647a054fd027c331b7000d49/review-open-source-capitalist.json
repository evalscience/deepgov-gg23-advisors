  "summary": "Ginakev Farms is a regenerative agroforestry project located in Nigeria, focusing on reforestation, land restoration, and sustainable agroforestry. The project aims to reverse the decline in tree cover due to unstructured farming practices by conserving mature trees and expanding tree cultivation. It plans to plant 643 palm trees by 2025 and aims for a long-term goal of 5,000 trees. The project also includes infrastructure development like borehole drilling and beekeeping to support biodiversity and community needs.",
  "review": "The Ginakev Farms project aligns well with the round's focus on ecosystem restoration and community involvement. It demonstrates a clear commitment to measurable restoration and long-term stewardship, as evidenced by its detailed plans for tree conservation and reforestation. The project also integrates community empowerment and technological innovation through its use of Hypercerts for impact verification. However, the application lacks specific data-backed proof of impact and does not provide a clear timeline for achieving its long-term goals. Additionally, while the project mentions community involvement, it does not detail how local communities are engaged in decision-making processes.",
