  "summary": "Ayowecca Uganda's project focuses on regenerative agricultural practices and climate education in Uganda, aiming to address food insecurity and environmental degradation through community-driven initiatives. The project has planted over 5,000 fruit trees and engages in wetland restoration, agroforestry, and educational programs. It emphasizes community empowerment and sustainable development, aligning with the round's focus on measurable restoration and community involvement.",
  "review": "The grant application by Ayowecca Uganda presents a comprehensive approach to tackling food insecurity and environmental degradation through regenerative agricultural practices and climate education. The project has a strong community focus, empowering local stakeholders to maintain and benefit from the initiatives. The use of fruit trees as a tool for both nutrition and environmental restoration is innovative and aligns with the round's requirements for measurable restoration and community involvement. However, the application lacks specific data-backed proof of impact and a clear plan for creating and publishing an Environmental Hypercert on Ecocertain.xyz, which are critical for meeting the round's eligibility criteria.",
