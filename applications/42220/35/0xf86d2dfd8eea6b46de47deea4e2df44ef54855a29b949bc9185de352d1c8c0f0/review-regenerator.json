  "review": "The application from Ayowecca Uganda presents a comprehensive approach to tackling food insecurity and environmental degradation through community-driven initiatives. The project has a strong focus on planting fruit trees and restoring ecosystems, which aligns well with the round's emphasis on measurable restoration and community involvement. The use of indigenous knowledge and community-led solutions is commendable, as it respects and integrates local wisdom and practices. However, the application could benefit from more detailed data on past impacts and clearer plans for scaling the project. Additionally, while the project mentions the use of hypercerts for verification, more information on how this will be implemented would strengthen the application.",
