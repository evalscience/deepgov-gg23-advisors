We are [**building an ecosystem**](https://link.kokonut.network/press) to connect web3 and agriculture. \n* We have created a blockchain-based cooperative to develop and manage a network of Syntropic Plantations.\n* Our main goal is to address the [**worldwide lack of funding for agricultural projects**](https://youtu.be/ZjygLVUSq4s). \n* We partner with [**farmers**](https://link.kokonut.network/KKN-Seeds-Deck) to get the funds they need while creating opportunities for web3 communities by giving them access & upside into perpetual natural assets.\n\n# TL;DR 🗒️\n\nKokonut Network is a decentralized ecosystem for building and deploying syntropic agroforestry farms using Web3 infrastructure. Its [open-source framework](https://framework.kokonut.network/) allows communities to design farms [optimized for diverse funding sources](https://x.com/WasabiNetwork/status/1898000651646390343) (**grants, DAOs, cooperatives, investors**) and impact outcomes (**public goods, financial returns, or blended**). Currently operating 2 live farms and developing 4 more across the Dominican Republic, Kokonut represents a powerful example of Web3 applied to real-world ecological and economic transformation.\n\nKokonut Network leverages blockchain and **open-source accounting** to create a **community-owned** network of nature-based **sustainable assets**. Our mission is to encourage, organize, fund, and oversee purpose-based Syntropic Farms.\n\nKokonut Network forges partnerships with stakeholders through the Kokonut Framework, which utilizes a combination of Agriculture, Blockchain, Land, and Weather. \n\n> **This synergy has no expiration date ♻️**\n\n# Table of Contents 📜\n\n 1.

By supporting open-source documentation and modular deployment, we contribute directly to the broader development and adoption of ReFi systems.\n* ⚙️ **Ecosystem Activity on Celo & Ethereum:** With ongoing deployments across Arbitrum, Ethereum, and growing interest in Celo’s OP Stack migration, Kokonut is well-positioned to contribute to the expansion of financial and on-chain activity across Ethereum-aligned networks.\n* 🌱 **Local Ecological, Social, and Economic Impact:** Each Kokonut farm represents a tangible, community-led regenerative project—generating food, livelihoods, biodiversity, and revenue through eco-friendly land use. The [Kokonut Framework](https://framework.kokonut.network/) allows customization based on funding models, enabling it to work across both grant-funded and for-profit scenarios. With 6 farms in development across the Dominican Republic, Kokonut is already catalyzing systemic change in underserved rural communities.\n\n# Quantitative & Qualitative: This is what you're helping bring to life 🌱\n\n## Kokonut Venus - Six Dimensions of Impact ♻️\n\n1. **WHAT** – The objective is to test our thesis by building and developing syntropic plantations via a community-centric model, which intersects real-life communities, web3 communities, and global culture. The outcome of this investment will create a perpetual asset that will improve people's lives in every aspect.\n2. **WHO** – The families who own the land where the project will be developed are underserved in every aspect, including education, finances, health, and opportunities. In Latin America, jobs and the economy mainly function in big cities, and the countryside is typically marginalized or taken advantage of by large corporations. A blockchain-based co-op can help remove many of these barriers.\n3. **HOW MUCH** – Approximately 3 families own the land for Kokonut Venus a 100% women-based leadership syntropic farm with 60+ direct beneficiaries looking to expand beyond fruits & vegetable by also producing organic eggs, and the project will create dozens of direct and indirect jobs. This will be life-changing for everyone, as it will provide opportunities and value for at least 10 years.\n4. **CONTRIBUTION** – Underserved individuals depend on these types of projects and new concepts that open doors to new paradigms and possibilities. The current system's criteria and entry-level are very high, making it difficult for those who cannot meet their standards.\n5. **RISK** – We have several fail safes in place, such as agricultural insurance, open-source cloud accounting systems, government and community oversight, and technical support from government agencies.\n6. **PUBLIC GOODS** – Kokonut Venus Farm will be allocating 10% of its net profits as donations toward Asociacion de Mujeres Saladilleras AMUSA (100% Women-based Local Cooperative) which the manager of Kokonut Venus is the Director and [Kokonut Foundation](https://kokonut.foundation/) to further help with their mission.\n\n# Why Kokonut Network? 🌴\n\nIn essence, Kokonut Network serves as the coordination layer that harnesses the power of web3 and open-source technologies to craft an adaptable organism capable of limitless expansion, thanks to its modular plug-and-play design framework.\n\nEvery component of our network is crafted in alignment with our [core values](https://kokonut.network/about).\n\nOur commitment extends to safeguarding the interests of minorities through a holistic approach.\n\n## 🌍 The Challenge We’re Tackling\n\nA global issue revolves around insufficient funding for agricultural projects, imposing immense stress on grassroots farmers. This contributes to deforestation, as people resort to using wood for cooking and cutting down trees due to limited financial incentives to protect their environment. Most of the labor is executed by farmers trapped in poverty due to the lack of avenues to improve their income. They lack the processes, knowledge, and resources necessary to compete with corporations that control over 90% of the global coconut market.\n\n## Our Solution\n\nBlockchain open data and protocols offer a solution that benefits DAO members, farmers, and partners. This involves simplifying fundraising and coordination processes while actively monitoring fauna, flora, and endangered species to create a holistic solution. Through a [framework](https://framework.kokonut.network/) with bullet-proof standardized processes, we create job opportunities and enhance the quality of life for those contributing to the network's well-being. The objective is to establish a fair mechanism for funding, managing, and developing Syntropic Farms while maintaining a commitment to environmental preservation.\n\n## Why coconuts? Zero Waste & Circular Crop 🥥♻️\n\nCoconut is the most cultivated and vital palm tree in the world, as it is the main source of vegetable fat. It is one of the plants that provide a wide variety of products and by-products, serving as a primary source of food, drinks, and shelter for animals.\n\nThe coconut products market size was valued at $11.5 billion in 2018 and is estimated to reach $31.1 billion by 2026, registering a CAGR of 13.6% from 2019 to 2026. In 2018, the coconut oil segment accounted for more than half of the total coconut products market share.\n\n> ***Coconut is a versatile fruit with many health, environmental and biodiversity benefits.***\n\n## Kokonut Ecosystem Climate Impact\n\nWe’re developing a hybrid framework to create positive community-centric impact, addressing systemic issues in underserved areas and enhancing climate resilience. Our approach focuses on sustainable solutions that improve daily lives and provide incentives without deforestation.\n\n## EBF Framework\n\nWe will track and report environmental and social impacts using the EBF Framework. Our reports, published via Karma GAP, will ensure long-term compatibility within the ReFi and Climate communities. \n\n> The [Kokonut Framework](https://framework.kokonut.network/) significantly contributes to air, soil, biodiversity, equity, and carbon benefits.\n\n# Regenerative Agriculture: SDGs & 8 Forms of Capital\n\n## Value Creation in a Community-Owned Syntropic Farm\n\n![](https://kokonut.network/files/8%20Forms%20Diagram.png \"\")\n\n# Unlimited Scaling — Kokonut Framework Use Case; Public Goods powered by Trees 🌳\n\n![](https://kokonut.network/files/Diagram%20v0.2%20-%20KKN%20Foundation.png \"\")\n\n# Our Vision 🔭\n\nKokonut Network was created to [reduce the obstacles to agricultural development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjygLVUSq4s&pp=ygURa29rb251dCBleHBsYWluZXI%3D), and rural project funding, and democratize investment in real-world projects. We use blockchain technology to establish plantations, creating opportunities for the global web3 communities and everyone in the network.\n\nWhat makes us different: Many DAOs have great ideas, copywriting, and marketing but without a solid business model. Unfortunately, many of these projects are rug-pulled or abandoned by users due to a lack of quality products.\n\n---\n\n# Main Resources 🔖\n* ***Website** [https://www.kokonut.network/](https://www.kokonut.network/)*\n* ***Let’s have a chat** [https://link.kokonut.network/meeting](https://link.kokonut.network/meeting)*\n* ***Tree of Links** [https://link3.to/kokonutnetwork](https://link3.to/kokonutnetwork)*\n* ***Kokonut Network Karma GAP Profile** [https://link.kokonut.network/karma](https://link.kokonut.network/karma)*\n* ***Kokonut Data Hub** [https://hub.kokonut.network/](https://hub.kokonut.network/)*\n* ***Kokonut Framework Docs*** <https://framework.kokonut.network>\n* ***Adelphi 3D Land Elevation Model*** <https://link.kokonut.network/AdelphiOrtho3D>\n* ***Adelphi Species GeoNode*** <https://link.kokonut.network/AdelphiSpeciesGeoNode>\n\n> **Thank you for reading.
