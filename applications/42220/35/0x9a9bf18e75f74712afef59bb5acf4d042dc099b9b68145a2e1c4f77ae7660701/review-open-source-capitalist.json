  "summary": "The Kokonut Network project aims to create a decentralized ecosystem for syntropic agroforestry farms using Web3 infrastructure. It focuses on connecting web3 and agriculture, addressing funding gaps for agricultural projects, and creating sustainable, community-owned networks of nature-based assets. The project aligns with the round's goals by using Hypercerts for impact verification and demonstrating measurable restoration and community involvement.",
  "review": "The Kokonut Network project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's objectives of ecosystem restoration and community involvement. The project leverages blockchain technology to create a decentralized, community-owned network of syntropic farms, which is innovative and scalable. The use of Hypercerts for impact verification and the focus on measurable restoration outcomes are strong points that align with the round's requirements. However, the application lacks specific data-backed proof of impact and detailed plans for long-term stewardship, which are critical for assessing the project's potential for sustainable impact. Additionally, while the project demonstrates a strong commitment to community involvement, it could benefit from more detailed descriptions of how it plans to engage and empower local communities in the long term.",
