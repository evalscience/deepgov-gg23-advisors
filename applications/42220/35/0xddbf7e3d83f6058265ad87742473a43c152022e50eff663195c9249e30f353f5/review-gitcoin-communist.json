The foundation has planted 3,400 trees and engaged various community groups, demonstrating a commitment to environmental and cultural preservation. The application aligns with the round's focus on grassroots nature stewardship and impact verification through Hypercerts.",
  "review": "The Pandu Alam Lestari Foundation presents a compelling case for funding, emphasizing the critical need for forest restoration in Central Kalimantan. The application highlights the foundation's efforts in planting 3,400 trees and engaging local communities, including women and youth, in sustainable land practices. This aligns well with the round's requirements for measurable restoration and community involvement. The foundation's use of Hypercerts for impact verification and its focus on long-term stewardship further strengthen its application. However, the application could benefit from more detailed data on the project's impact and sustainability plans to reduce dependency on continuous donations. Additionally, while the project demonstrates strong community involvement, it should provide more evidence of its governance structures and how it plans to ensure equitable distribution of benefits across different communities.",
