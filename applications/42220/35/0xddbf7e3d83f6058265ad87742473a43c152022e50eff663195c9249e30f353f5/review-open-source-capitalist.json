  "review": "The Pandu Alam Lestari Foundation's application is well-aligned with the round's objectives, focusing on grassroots nature stewardship and community involvement. The project demonstrates measurable restoration efforts, such as planting 3,400 trees and engaging local communities in sustainable practices. The foundation's approach integrates environmental education, cultural preservation, and economic resilience, which are crucial for long-term impact. However, the application lacks detailed data-backed proof of impact and specific metrics for measuring success. Additionally, the project's scalability and potential for broader impact could be further elaborated.",
