            "description": "From 2022 to December 2023, the Pandu Alam Lestari Foundation (PAL), supported by Heidehof Stiftung, piloted a land restoration project in Bawan Village, Central Kalimantan. The initiative focused on rehabilitating fire-impacted land through agroforestry, planting 3,400 trees across 10 hectares and integrating environmental education and sustainable land practices.\n\nThroughout 2023, regular maintenance was conducted every three months, including cleaning around the trees, applying manure, and replacing dead seedlings. These efforts, spanning both rainy and dry seasons, engaged local farmers, students, and womenâ€™s groups in long-term restoration and agroforestry practices.\n\nIn a region where land restoration competes with extractive industries like mining and palm oil plantations, the project gauged local interest in agroforestry as a viable, sustainable alternative. Despite challenges such as poor soil and limited landowner participation, the project laid the groundwork for future community-led restoration efforts and economic resilience."
