        "description": "# **üåç The Challenge We‚Äôre Tackling**\n\nThe People's Organization called Capalonga Mangrove Development Association, Inc in Capalonga, Camarines Norte, is home to over 1,800 hectares of mangrove areas, including abandoned fishponds. While restoring these areas seems like the obvious solution, large-scale restoration without careful assessment can backfire, disrupting local ecosystems and doing more harm than good. We intervened in the planting plans for an initially identified 1,209 hectares by a third-party company, whose approach was solely based on satellite imagery. Upon evaluation, we found that their method could lead to ecological damage and emphasized the need for a thorough, science-based feasibility assessment before proceeding with any large-scale intervention. Without a solid understanding of which areas are ecologically viable for restoration, even the best intentions can result in negative outcomes.\n\n# **üìú Our Solution**\n\nWe conducted a science-driven feasibility study to evaluate these 1,209 hectares. After thorough GIS mapping, ecological surveys, and community consultations, we discovered that only 39 hectares are truly viable for restoration. This small but high-impact area is where we‚Äôll focus our efforts, ensuring that restoration happens without causing unintended ecological damage. Our approach blends passive and active restoration techniques, with community members trained to propagate diverse native mangrove species beyond the usual Rhizophora spp.\n\n**üå± Our Organisation/Community**\n\nWovoka Philippines and the members of the Capalonga Mangrove Development Association (CAMADA), a group of local upland farmers, worked closely to conduct on-site sampling and measurements of mangrove forests, map historical land cover changes using satellite data and interviews, and identify the most suitable assemblage of mangrove species for planting. As an extension of the feasibility study, we‚Äôre now advancing our research and biodiversity monitoring while equipping CAMADA‚Äôs farmer-members to lead the restoration efforts. They‚Äôre being trained to use cutting-edge tools like multispectral imaging, eDNA sampling, and bioacoustic monitoring to track ecosystem recovery and ensure long-term success.\n\n\n# **üñºÔ∏è See Our Impact**\n\n üîó [View Our Hypercert](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/hypercert/42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-46278401901247631031018946610720476758016)\n\n![](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/_next/image?url=%2Fapi%2Fhypercert-image%2F42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-46278401901247631031018946610720476758016&w=384&q=75)\n\n# **üìù What This Hypercert Represents**\nThis hypercert documents the completion of a science-based feasibility assessment that scoped more than 1,900 hectares of tenured land and identified 39 hectares of viable mangrove restoration sites.
