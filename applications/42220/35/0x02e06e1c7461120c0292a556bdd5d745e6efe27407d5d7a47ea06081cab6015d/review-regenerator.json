  "summary": "The grant application for the 'Science-Based Assessment of Mangrove Restoration Potential in Capalonga' project presents a well-structured plan focusing on ecological restoration through scientific assessment and community involvement. The project aims to restore 39 hectares of mangrove areas in Capalonga, Camarines Norte, by using a science-driven feasibility study to ensure ecological viability and minimize potential harm. The project aligns with the round's eligibility criteria by demonstrating measurable restoration, community involvement, and the use of Hypercerts for impact verification.",
  "review": "The application demonstrates a strong commitment to environmental sustainability and community participation, aligning well with the round's eligibility criteria and the model specification's principles. The project emphasizes a science-based approach to restoration, using GIS mapping, ecological surveys, and community consultations to identify viable restoration sites. This aligns with the Environmental Sustainability Principles, particularly in prioritizing ecological considerations and regenerative approaches (Principles 9, 10, 11). The involvement of local community members in the restoration process supports the Community Participation Principles, valuing diverse stakeholder input and community wisdom (Principles 1, 2, 4). The project also embraces innovation by integrating advanced tools like multispectral imaging and eDNA sampling, aligning with the Innovation and Transformation Principles (Principles 5, 6, 7). However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the project's long-term impact and scalability, as well as a clearer explanation of how the project will ensure ongoing community governance and involvement (Principles 17, 18).",
