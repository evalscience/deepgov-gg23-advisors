  "summary": "The grant application for the 'Science-Based Assessment of Mangrove Restoration Potential in Capalonga' project is a well-structured proposal that aligns with the round's focus on grassroots nature stewardship and measurable restoration impact. The project emphasizes a science-driven approach to mangrove restoration, ensuring ecological viability and community involvement. It highlights the importance of data-backed decision-making and long-term sustainability, which are crucial for successful ecosystem restoration.",
  "review": "The application presents a compelling case for the restoration of mangrove areas in Capalonga, Camarines Norte. The project is led by Wovoka Philippines in collaboration with the Capalonga Mangrove Development Association (CAMADA), focusing on a science-based feasibility study to identify viable restoration sites. The project aligns with the round's eligibility criteria by demonstrating measurable restoration impact, community involvement, and the use of Hypercerts for impact verification. The application provides evidence of a thorough feasibility study, including GIS mapping, ecological surveys, and community consultations, which identified 39 hectares as viable for restoration. This approach ensures that restoration efforts are ecologically sound and community-driven. The project also emphasizes the use of advanced tools like multispectral imaging and eDNA sampling, showcasing a commitment to innovative and data-driven methods. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the project's long-term sustainability and revenue model to reduce dependency on continuous donations. Additionally, while the project demonstrates strong community involvement, further details on governance structures and how community input is integrated into decision-making would strengthen the application.",
