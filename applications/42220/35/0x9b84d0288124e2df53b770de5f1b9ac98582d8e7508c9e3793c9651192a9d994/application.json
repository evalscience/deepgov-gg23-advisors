However, this ancient ecosystem is under severe threat. Decades of pollution, habitat degradation, invasive species, and untreated wastewater have disrupted ecological balance. Climate change has exacerbated these pressures, making the survival of the axolotl and the biodiversity it supports increasingly difficult. If no action is taken, we risk losing an iconic species and the environmental services this ecosystem provides, including aquifer recharge and traditional agriculture.\n![Image](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmReXYg6JqxARvLaktCwCTTYCJ7toQ75QAAydQvsbgnVos){MC4zNzQzMD:64}\n\n### Our Solution\n\nThis project, led by MOJA, focuses on the ecological restoration of a 3-hectare lagoon within the Xochimilco wetland. The goal is to establish the largest natural sanctuary for axolotls in the area. Through community participation, environmental education, and scientific monitoring, we are reintroducing native aquatic vegetation, installing floating axolotl enclosures to protect them from invasive species, and improving water quality conditions. We are also building sustainable infrastructure for long-term conservation efforts, including rainwater harvesting systems and facilities for education and monitoring.\n![alt text](https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=1920x400:format=jpg/path/s033283336e5bbdf3/image/iad7e7b7916426326/version/1594689741/image.jpg){MC4zNzQzMD:64}\n\n### Our Organisation / Community\n\nMOJA is a Mexican environmental NGO committed to the protection and restoration of ecosystems through community-based approaches. We work with local farmers, educators, researchers, and students to promote ecological awareness and action. More than 160 volunteers and over 200 students have been directly involved in our restoration efforts, making this a collaborative and inclusive conservation project.\n\n![alt text](https://lightroom.adobe.com/v2c/spaces/496c52e094114decbdf4efba5b209ce0/assets/5df7222fb0394a348fa7a49219d6929f/revisions/22e72d18b9ad464694412b4314a0b4dd/renditions/6d9539afc71a5dba19964ab0291f7943){MC40Nzc4Mj:62}\n\n### See Our Impact \n\nYOUTUBE MOJA CHANEL:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDEvAW9rIRk\n\nFACEBOOK BLOG:\nhttps://web.facebook.com/moja.ong/?locale=es_LA&_rdc=1&_rdr#\n\nVOLUNTERING WITH STUDENTS:\nhttps://lightroom.adobe.com/shares/496c52e094114decbdf4efba5b209ce0\n\n[View Our Hypercert here](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/hypercert/42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-51382637405061707982969565722196999929856)!\n\n![alt text](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/_next/image?url=%2Fapi%2Fhypercert-image%2F42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-51382637405061707982969565722196999929856&w=640&q=75){MC40Nzc4Mj:62}\n\n### What This Hypercert Represents\n\nThis Hypercert certifies the restoration of 3 hectares of wetland in Xochimilco.
