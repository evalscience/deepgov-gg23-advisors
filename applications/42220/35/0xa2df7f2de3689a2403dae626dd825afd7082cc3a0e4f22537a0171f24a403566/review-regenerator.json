  "summary": "Hofi Kolektivo is an agroforestry project in Curacao aimed at enhancing the island's self-sufficiency and community well-being through innovative and sustainable practices. The project has demonstrated significant community involvement and environmental impact, including the restoration of 0.2 hectares of land and the planting of over 300 trees. It aligns with the round's focus on grassroots nature stewardship and uses Hypercerts for impact verification.",
  "review": "The Hofi Kolektivo project presents a compelling case for funding under the 'Hypercerts for Nature Stewards' round. The project addresses a critical issue in Curacao, where 80% of food is imported, leading to unreliable and costly food supply chains. By promoting agroforestry, Hofi Kolektivo not only aims to increase local food production but also enhances environmental sustainability and community resilience. The project has already made measurable impacts, such as restoring 0.2 hectares of land and engaging over 250 community members in its activities. This aligns well with the round's requirements for measurable restoration and community involvement. However, the application could benefit from more detailed data-backed proof of impact and a clearer plan for long-term stewardship and scalability. Additionally, while the project uses Hypercerts, further integration with Ecocertain.xyz for funding and visibility could strengthen its proposal.",
