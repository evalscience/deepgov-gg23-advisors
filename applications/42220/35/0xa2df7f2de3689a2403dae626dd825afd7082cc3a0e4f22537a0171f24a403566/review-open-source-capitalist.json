  "summary": "Hofi Kolektivo is an agroforestry project in Curacao aimed at reducing the island's dependency on imported food by promoting local food production through community engagement and environmental restoration. The project has demonstrated measurable impact through community workdays, workshops, and the planting of diverse tree species, including endangered ones. It aligns with the round's focus on ecosystem restoration and community involvement, using Hypercerts for impact verification.",
  "review": "The Hofi Kolektivo project is a commendable initiative addressing the critical issue of food security in Curacao by promoting agroforestry. The project has shown significant community involvement and environmental impact, which aligns well with the round's eligibility criteria. The use of Hypercerts for impact verification and the provision of data-backed proof of impact are strong points. However, the application lacks detailed information on long-term sustainability plans and scalability beyond the local context, which are crucial for maximizing total impact as per the model specification. Additionally, while the project has a clear local impact, it does not fully address the broader systemic changes or innovative approaches that could enhance its scalability and efficiency.",
