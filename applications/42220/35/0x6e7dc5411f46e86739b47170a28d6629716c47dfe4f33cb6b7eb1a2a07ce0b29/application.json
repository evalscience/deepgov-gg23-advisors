Our Water & Green Life program combines access to clean water with environmental restoration to support healthier, more resilient communities.\n[![trees-planting.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/4xvYnH3N/trees-planting.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/XrJjzJFT)\n\nIn Ogbunka, Anambra State and Amechi primary school, we installed a solar-powered borehole at Umunebo Ogbunka and water facility at Amechi primary. This system now provides safe drinking water to students and nearby residents. Before installation, we conducted a community needs assessment involving local leaders, women, and youth to ensure the solution fit local realities. Community members also supported the site selection and implementation process, making it a truly participatory effort.\n[![tree-planting33.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/nzFBnYYJ/tree-planting33.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/rdHKJ4Pn)\n\nComplementing this, our tree planting program helps protect water sources and restore the natural ecosystem. Over 500 native trees have been planted around water points, schools, and communal lands. These trees prevent erosion, support groundwater recharge, and improve air quality. Tree planting activities are also tied to school programs and youth engagement.\n\n[![solarsystem.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/Gt05pV49/solarsystem.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/sQcc6n9R) \n\n\nTogether, clean water access and tree planting not only reduce disease and environmental degradation but also empower communities to protect their resources. The Water & Green Life program reflects our commitment to long-term impact—where people and the planet thrive side by side.\n\n[![solar-water.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/PqLS1FyV/solar-water.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/qtTcTw92)\n\nEvidence of our water project: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/kMwNuYFoIxY  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F1v2Lcd1-I  ,   \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROQ3EqMYavA\n\nSolar lantern project\n\n https://youtu.be/DM_BtE1FgI0    \n\n https://youtu.be/lYvGZjs1MKY  \n\n                                                         Tree planting program\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jIgfgWqMr0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TVv6_ZkCJc\n\n\nView our Hypercert [here](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/hypercert/42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-63632802614215492667651051589740655542272)\n\n![alt text](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/_next/image?url=%2Fapi%2Fhypercert-image%2F42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-63632802614215492667651051589740655542272&w=640&q=75)",
