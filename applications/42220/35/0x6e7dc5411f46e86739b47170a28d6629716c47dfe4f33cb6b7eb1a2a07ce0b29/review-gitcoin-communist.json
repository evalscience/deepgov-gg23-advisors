  "summary": "The \"Greening Nigeria: Clean Water & Tree Planting\" project by Helpers Social Development Foundation aims to improve rural well-being through sustainable, community-led initiatives. The project focuses on providing clean water access and environmental restoration through tree planting in Ogbunka, Anambra State, and Amechi primary school. The project has installed solar-powered boreholes and planted over 500 native trees to protect water sources and restore ecosystems. The initiative emphasizes community involvement and long-term impact, aligning with the round's focus on measurable restoration, community involvement, and the use of Hypercerts for impact verification.",
  "review": "The project demonstrates a strong alignment with the round's eligibility criteria, particularly in terms of community involvement and measurable impact. The installation of solar-powered boreholes and tree planting activities are well-documented, with evidence provided through videos and a Hypercert. The project's focus on sustainable, community-led initiatives and environmental restoration aligns with the model specification's emphasis on sustainability, community governance, and collective impact. However, the application lacks detailed information on the project's long-term sustainability model and specific data-backed proof of impact, which are crucial for a comprehensive evaluation.",
