  "summary": "The \"Greening Nigeria: Clean Water & Tree Planting\" project by Helpers Social Development Foundation aims to improve rural well-being through sustainable initiatives, focusing on clean water access and environmental restoration. The project has installed solar-powered boreholes and water facilities in Anambra State, Nigeria, and has planted over 500 native trees to protect water sources and restore ecosystems. The project emphasizes community involvement and long-term impact, aligning with the round's focus on measurable restoration and community accountability.",
  "review": "The project aligns well with the round's eligibility criteria, demonstrating measurable restoration through clean water access and tree planting. The use of solar-powered technology and community involvement in the project design and implementation are commendable. The project provides evidence of impact through videos and a Hypercert, which supports its claims of community and environmental benefits. However, the application lacks detailed data-backed proof of impact and specific metrics for measuring long-term success. Additionally, while the project shows potential for scalability, the application does not clearly outline how it plans to expand its impact beyond the current locations.",
