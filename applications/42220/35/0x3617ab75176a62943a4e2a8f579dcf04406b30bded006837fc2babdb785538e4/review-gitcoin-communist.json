  "summary": "Project OSISI is a grassroots initiative focused on combating climate change in Africa through tree-planting events. The project is inspired by traditional community-driven environmental conservation practices and aims to empower local land stewards with tools to plant trees, capture ecological data, and earn rewards. The project has established a pilot tree garden in Lagos and has secured partnerships with local communities, schools, NGOs, and governments to implement tree-planting festivals. The project seeks funding to support the sourcing and nursing of seedlings and to lead tree-planting festivals in schools and climate-affected communities.",
  "review": "Project OSISI presents a compelling case for addressing the climate crisis in Africa through community-driven tree-planting initiatives. The project aligns well with the round's focus on grassroots nature stewardship and the use of Hypercerts for impact verification. The application provides clear evidence of impact, including the establishment of a pilot tree garden and partnerships with local entities. The project's focus on empowering local communities and promoting climate education is commendable. However, the application lacks detailed information on the project's long-term sustainability and revenue model, which is crucial for reducing dependency on continuous donations. Additionally, while the project demonstrates community involvement, it could benefit from a more structured governance framework to ensure accountability and scalability.",
