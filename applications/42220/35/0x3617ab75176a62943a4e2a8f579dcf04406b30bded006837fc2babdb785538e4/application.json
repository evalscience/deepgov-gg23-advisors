        "description": "**üåçProblem Worth Solving**\n\nAfrica's climate crisis is complex. Temperatures in the Sahel region are rising 1.5 times faster than the global average due to increased urbanization and severe deforestation, both of which increase carbon emissions. \n\nDeforestation in Nigeria has led to the [loss of 96% of the country's primary forest](https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/09/deforestation-nigeria-has-lost-96-of-its-forest-ncf/). This has exacerbated climate change impacts, including biodiversity loss, heat waves, and [severe coastal erosion](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2022/6/1/in-oil-rich-niger-delta-coastal-erosion-is-outliving-residents)  in the country. \n![Deforestation in Nigeria](https://i.ibb.co/yRPM3DG/Gitcoin.png) \n\n**[Climate change costs Africa $15 billion per year,](https://www.afdb.org/en/cop28/focus-africa)** which exceeds the GDPs of 26 African countries. By 2050, it could reach $50 billion. Climate change impacts disadvantaged communities and threatens traditional livelihoods. With low access to climate finance, millions of smallholder farmers and land stewards are unable to adapt. Addressing this issue is critical for environmental sustainability and community well-being, and we are passionate about helping to solve it. \n\n**üìú Our Solution**\n**[Project OSISI](http://osisi.earth/)** is a ReFi project combating climate change through tree-planting events in Africa. It is inspired by [Mbom-Uzo Festival](https://acjol.org/index.php/ajap/article/view/1340/1315), an ancient community-driven environmental conservation festival celebrated by some Igbo communities in southeast Nigeria. OSISI allows impact donors to efficiently support tree-planting festivals with real-time data and impact reports.
