        "description": "#### 🌍 The Challenge We’re Tackling\n[ \nMangroves are the coastal guardians with more than ten times the capacity to absorb our carbon emissions than the tropical rainforest, and are the most powerful trees for climate mitigation. Sadly, these were cut in the past, with Tanzania having lost more than 100,000 hectares. Restoration is highly needed at the moment to enable uptake of 100 million tons of carbon by 2040, and support communities on sites.]\n\n#### 📜 Our Solution\n[\nBlue Carbon Tanzania (BCT) works with coastal communities to restore mangroves and support sustainable livelihoods like beekeeping. Since January 2025, we’ve planted 4,320 mangroves in Kisiju, protecting coastlines, supporting biodiversity, and capturing ~2,000 tons of CO₂—equal to removing 1,500 🚗 cars from the road! Every $1 plants a 🌱 mangrove. Join us in scaling this impact! 🌍💚\n]\n\n#### 🌱Our organisation/ Community\n[\nBlue Carbon Tanzania (BCT) partners with coastal communities to restore mangroves and create sustainable livelihoods.
