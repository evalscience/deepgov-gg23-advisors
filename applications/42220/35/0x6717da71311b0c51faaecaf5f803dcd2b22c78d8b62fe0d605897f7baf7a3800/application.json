        "description": "\n# About Formosa Art Bank DAO (FAB DAO)\n\nFAB DAO, also known as Formosa Art Bank DAO, is a self-governing organization for charity NFTs since 2021. The largest charity NFT fundraising project in Taiwan, the \"Project Percentage, %\", brought together cross-disciplinary organizations and individuals to create a new system and style in Taiwan NFT market that combines the theme of charity, art and culture.\n\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/projectpercentage\n\nFAB DAO focuses on minting and selling non-profit NFTs, creating artist and collector communities, building blockchain experiences and designing blockchain education for the public. With goodness and eternity as our starting point, we are building a connected Web3 metaverse. We will apply the good features of blockchain to take the real actions in the real world.\n\n# Background\n\nAs FAB DAO became formally DAO in April 2023, the core team handed over the management of FAB DAO to the communities. Different initiatives and ideas were raised and discussed within FAB DAO.\n\nAt the same time, Public Goods ecosystems grew under the support of Gitcoin and other organizations. As one of the pioneers in Public Goods, GreenPill would like to share its experience and develop local chapters for different cities over the world.\n\nWhen two communities connected with each other, the idea of Taiwan Chapter was born.\n\nMission & Vision, Value alignment\n\nGreen Sofa aligns with the mission and vision of GreenPill, which is to build a global network society transcending national and cultural boundaries, while exporting regenerative digital infrastructure to the world.\n\nAs one team under FAB DAO, Green Sofa aims to explore the possiblity of collaboration wtih GreenPill international and FAB DAO. It is a school for FAB DAO learning from GreenPill about Public Goods, e.g. QF/QV, Gitcoin Grants Stack. It is also a laboratory for FAB DAO to apply the knowledge, kick off hands-on projects in smaller scale, to gain local experiences and feedback to FAB DAO and GreenPill.\n\nCritical success factors\n\nIncrease awareness of the GreenPill and look for collaboration opportunity with FAB DAO\n\nLearn and apply GreenPill related tools and knowledge to support FAB DAO development, e.g. QF/QV, Gitcoin Grants Stack, Hypercert.\n\nAct as the communication channel between FAB DAO and GreenPill International and other local chapters.\n\n# Hypercert project: Tamagochi at Riverside\n\nProject Website: https://www.facebook.com/our.river.region\n\n[Tamagochi at Riverside Hypercert](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/hypercert/42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-44917272433563877177165448180993403912192)\n\n![Tamagochi at Riverside Hypercert](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/_next/image?url=%2Fapi%2Fhypercert-image%2F42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-44917272433563877177165448180993403912192&w=640&q=75)\n\n# üåç The Challenge We‚Äôre Tackling  \nIn rapidly urbanized cities like Taipei, rivers are often overlooked, over-dredged, and stripped of biodiversity. The Huangxi River (Southern Sulfur Creek), once teeming with life, has seen its ecosystem disrupted by aggressive vegetation clearing and human detachment. Shy native species like the White-breasted Waterhen have nearly vanished from view. If we don't act now, we risk losing not only vital habitats but also the community's connection to the very nature flowing beside them.\n\n---\n\n# üìú Our Solution  \n**Tamagochi at Riverside** brings together environmental education, civic action, and Web3 technology to rewild our imaginations‚Äîand our rivers. Partnering with Huangxi Environmental Education Programme (HEEP) and Formosa Art Bank DAO (FAB DAO), we designed a playful, powerful campaign where students and citizens alike complete ecological missions, earn interactive NFTs, and re-learn how to live with rivers as neighbors. Through school programs, community workshops, and NFT collectibles, we‚Äôre rebuilding bonds between people and place‚Äîand helping wildlife thrive again.\n\n---\n\n# üå± Our Organisation / Community  \nWe are a collaboration between **HEEP**, a grassroots environmental education initiative, and **FAB DAO**, a Web3 collective focused on public good. Together, we‚Äôve built a vibrant, decentralized community of educators, parents, artists, technologists, and river-lovers. We‚Äôve reached **50,000+ local residents**, **20+ community partners**, and over **3,000 students and parents** from Mingde Elementary School alone.\n\n[GreenSofa_TW](https://hackmd.io/@greensofa/home) |  [FAB FAO](https://fabdao.world/) |  [HEEP](https://www.facebook.com/our.river.region)\n\n---\n\n# üñºÔ∏è See Our Impact  \n- [Tamagochi at Riverside NFT](https://akaswap.com/akaobj/14470)  \n- [Heart of the River Corridor POAP](https://akaswap.com/akaobj/14471)\n\n---\n\n# üîó [View Our Hypercert](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/hypercert/42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-44917272433563877177165448180993403912192)\n\n---\n\n# üìù What This Hypercert Represents  \nBetween **March and December 2023**, we ran school-wide ecological challenges, issued **300+ proof-of-attendance NFTs (POAPs)**, hosted over **10 public events**, and piloted habitat recovery in **2 riverbank zones**. We replaced top-down conservation messaging with community-led learning. Students adopted digital Waterhen ‚Äúpets,‚Äù learned through play, and became stewards of real-world habitats‚Äîhelping restore native biodiversity and reshape urban watershed governance.\n\n---\n\n# ‚úÖ Proof That It‚Äôs Working  \nNative species like the **White-breasted Waterhen** have dewelled to rehabilitated zones. Over **300 NFTs** were minted to mark engagement. Student feedback and observational data confirm increased ecological awareness and behavioral change.  \n\nüìÇ [See the Proof of Impact](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OXgtcFSb46AR2ktN9Dq2R3CYoUXnr_Td?usp=sharing)\n\n---\n\n# üí° Join Us in Making a Difference!  \nYour support helps us scale this playful, powerful model to other schools, rivers, and cities.
