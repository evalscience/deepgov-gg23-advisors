Solar lanterns provide light and charging for phones to those living without electricity. We see the lanterns as the first step to bringing people out of energy poverty. We have received feedback that they have helped children study at night, help keep phones charged and provide light at evening markets.\n\nAyowecca Uganda - Tororo, Uganda - 285 lanterns\nHelper Foundation - Enugu, Nigeria - 50 lanterns\nCare for the Needy - Mityana, Uganda - 15 lanterns"
