  "summary": "The Solar Foundation's grant application focuses on providing solar lanterns to underserved communities in East and West Africa, aiming to improve energy access and contribute to SDG7. The project emphasizes community involvement, sustainable energy solutions, and the use of blockchain technology for funding and impact verification. The application aligns with the round's focus on grassroots nature stewardship and the use of Hypercerts for impact verification.",
  "review": "The Solar Foundation's application presents a compelling case for funding, with a clear focus on providing solar lanterns to communities in Uganda and Nigeria. The project aligns with the round's goals by using Hypercerts for impact verification and demonstrating community involvement. The application highlights the potential for solar lanterns to improve health, economic opportunities, and climate resilience, which are critical aspects of sustainable development. However, the application lacks detailed data-backed proof of impact and a clear plan for long-term sustainability beyond initial funding. The use of blockchain technology for funding and impact verification is innovative, but the application would benefit from more concrete evidence of its effectiveness in this context.",
