        "description": "## About Us\n\nThe Solar Foundationâ€™s mission is to fund and accelerate off-grid solar solutions for underserved communities in emerging markets with a focus on Sub-Saharan Africa. We believe decentralized clean energy is a public good, and that by partnering with community led NGOs and utilizing new technologies such as blockchain, we can accelerate progress toward SDG7: Universal access to affordable, reliable, clean and modern energy.\n\nThrough our work in Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya and Nigeria, we have seen how small, decentralized solutions provide ripples of exponential impact including improved health outcomes, increased economic opportunities and greater climate adaptation and resilience. The Solar Foundationâ€™s focus is evolving towards off-grid, full-stack, solar solutions for local, high-impact organizations such as schools, healthcare centers, community centers and agroforestry and regenerative farming cooperatives.\n\nAt The Solar Foundation, we envision innovative, sustainable funding models to enable rural, low-income communities to access clean energy and have an ownership stake in the solar deployed. Our aim is to democratize access to solar solutions and solar-powered appliances for improved well-being and prosperityâ€”and a just transition to clean energy for ALL.\n\n## Solar Lanterns\nWe fund and give away solar lanterns in many of the communities we serve. We think of access to solar as a ladder with solar lanterns being the first rung up the ladder to energy access and independence. \n[![Media-post-from-The-Solar-Foundation.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/9QC5m7Yf/Media-post-from-The-Solar-Foundation.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/tYSmD7f0)\nIn 2024, The Solar Foundation funded and distributed 350 solar lanterns to communities in Uganda and Nigeria. Solar lanterns provide light and charging for phones to those living without electricity. We see the lanterns as the first step to bringing people out of energy poverty. We have received feedback that they have helped children study at night, help keep phones charged and provide light at evening markets. \n[![Media-post-from-The-Solar-Foundation-2.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/hjJNybc2/Media-post-from-The-Solar-Foundation-2.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/qhTmgKtK)\n\n## Solar Lanterns Funded in 2024\n\n - Ayowecca Uganda - Tororo, Uganda - 285 lanterns \n- Helper Foundation - Enugu, Nigeria - 50 lanterns \n- Care for the Needy - Mityana, Uganda - 15 lanterns\n\n[![Media-post-from-The-Solar-Foundation-1.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/hPn3Tqzy/Media-post-from-The-Solar-Foundation-1.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/5jP3WTmL)\n\n## Our Ecocert\n\nWe have minted an Ecocert to represent the impact of the solar lanterns we distributed in 2024.
