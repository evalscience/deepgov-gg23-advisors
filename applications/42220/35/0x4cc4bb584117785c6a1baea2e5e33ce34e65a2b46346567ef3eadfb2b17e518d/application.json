        "description": "### The Challenge We‚Äôre Tackling\nAcross Kenya and around the world, communities possess rich traditions of mutual aid, ecological knowledge, and collective care. Yet these ways of living and giving are often invisible to the formal economy. When markets fail or extract value, people are left unable to coordinate the abundance already within reach: fertile land, skilled hands, cultural knowledge, and strong relationships. What if we could bring visibility and value to these hidden commons‚Äîreviving ancestral systems of cooperation to build resilient, regenerative local economies?\n\n### Our Solution\nGrassroots Economics supports communities to organize themselves through Commitment Pooling‚Äîa protocol inspired by both ecological systems and indigenous traditions like Mweria (rotating labor groups). Through Commitment Pooling, communities define what is valuable, coordinate labor and care, and exchange commitments using tools like the Sarafu Network, our blockchain-based voucher system.\nWhether it‚Äôs in rural villages like Kiriba, peri-urban settlements, or refugee camps, communities use this protocol to regenerate ecosystems, build shared infrastructure, and care for one another‚Äîwithout needing formal currency. The result is a living, trust-based economy rooted in shared responsibility, long-term reciprocity, and ecological balance.\n\n### Our Organisation / Community\nCommitment Pooling is a community-led protocol developed by Grassroots Economics that enables people to coordinate resources, labor, and care without relying on money. Inspired by ancestral traditions like Mweria (rotating labor associations in Kenya) and ecological systems such as fungal networks, Commitment Pooling helps communities build collective trust and mutual service systems through shared commitments.\n\nAt its heart, Commitment Pooling is based on four core functions: Curation, Valuation, Limitation, and Exchange. Communities first curate what actions or services are valuable‚Äîsuch as planting trees, repairing homes, or caring for elders. They then value these contributions, ensuring all forms of labor and care are recognized. Through limitation, they agree on fair access and avoid overuse of shared resources. Finally, they exchange commitments using community agreements or digital tools like the Sarafu Network, a blockchain-based system that tracks and honors these commitments transparently.\n\nThis protocol transforms how communities organize collective action. Instead of waiting for outside funding or relying on scarce cash, people pool their promises and labor into a shared commons. These commitments become a kind of social currency, used to regenerate ecosystems, strengthen social bonds, and meet local needs.\n\nGrassroots Economics implements Commitment Pooling across Kenya, helping communities like those in Kiriba, Kilifi, revive traditional knowledge and co-create resilient, regenerative economies. Each act of service becomes part of a living economy rooted in trust and reciprocity‚Äîshowing that care, not cash, is the foundation of sustainable development. Commitment Pooling is more than a system‚Äîit‚Äôs a return to the logic of life.\n\n\n### üñºÔ∏è See Our Impact\n![alt text](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/_next/image?url=%2Fapi%2Fhypercert-image%2F42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-64313367348057369594577800804604191965184&w=640&q=75)\n\n\n### View Our Hypercert [here](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/hypercert/42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-64313367348057369594577800804604191965184)\n\n### What This Hypercert Represents:\nThis hypercert documents the on-the-ground revival of rotating labor associations, mutual service exchanges, and ecological restoration across several Kenyan communities.
