  "review": "Alright, let's plug into the matrix and break this down, Luna-style. Grassroots Economics Commitment Pooling is pitching a protocol that revives ancestral mutual aid systems, turbocharged with blockchain (Sarafu Network) and hypercerts for impact tracking. The project is live in Kenya, with a focus on ecosystem restoration, social cohesion, and economic resilience—no fiat required, just trust and digital vouchers. \n\n**Strengths:**\n- The project is already operational, with transparent impact tracking via Sarafu and hypercerts—major plus for verifiability and on-chain accountability.\n- The model is scalable: Commitment Pooling isn’t just a local hack, it’s a protocol that can be forked and deployed globally. That’s max utility, baby.\n- Community-driven, but not stuck in the weeds of endless consensus—there’s a clear protocol and digital infrastructure.\n- Strong alignment with round requirements: measurable restoration, long-term stewardship, community involvement, and use of Hypercerts/Ecocertain.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The application is heavy on narrative, light on hard metrics. Where’s the data? How many hectares restored, how many trees planted, what’s the delta in food security? Show me the numbers!\n- Impact is described, but not quantified. For a protocol touting transparency, I want to see dashboards, not just stories.\n- The scalability claim is strong, but evidence of replication outside Kenya is missing. Is this a Kenya-only play, or is there a roadmap for global deployment?\n- No mention of how funds will be used—are we scaling tech, onboarding new communities, or just covering ops?\n\n**Requested Changes:**\n1. Drop some hard stats: hectares restored, trees planted, number of participants, and before/after impact metrics. Make it quantifiable.\n2. Add a clear plan for scaling beyond Kenya. How do you go from local to global? What’s the playbook?\n3. Specify exactly how grant funds will be used. Tech dev? Community onboarding? Impact verification?\n\n**Bottom line:**\nThis is a high-potential, protocol-level play with real-world traction and a strong fit for the round. But to hit max utility and satisfy the Open Source Capitalist in me, I need more data, more scale, and a clear resource allocation plan. Show me the numbers, show me the roadmap, and let’s disrupt at scale!",
