  "summary": "The Oceanus Conservation project aims to address the significant decline in mangrove cover in the Philippines by integrating local knowledge with technology to enhance community capacity in mangrove restoration. The project focuses on training local communities in restoration techniques, seedling propagation, and monitoring, while also providing economic incentives through eco-tourism and nursery sapling sales. The project has demonstrated measurable impact through the documentation of 600 mangrove trees using digital tools, providing supplemental income to local surveyors and increasing community engagement in conservation efforts.",
  "review": "The Oceanus Conservation project presents a well-structured approach to addressing the decline in mangrove cover in the Philippines. The project effectively integrates local knowledge with scientific methods, providing a strong foundation for community engagement and long-term conservation success. The use of digital tools for data collection and monitoring is a notable strength, as it enhances the accuracy and efficiency of impact measurement. The project aligns well with the round's eligibility criteria, demonstrating measurable restoration, community involvement, and the use of Hypercerts for impact verification. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the project's sustainability model and long-term funding strategy to ensure continued impact beyond the initial grant period.",
