            "description": "The BKCF Project: AI/Machine Learning-powered Digital Monitoring of Mangrove Ecosystems is a collaboration between Thinking Machines, Oceanus Conservation, and GainForest, conducted in Bislig, Surigao del Sur, Philippines. Oceanus trained 11 local surveyors to use smartphones for data collection, replacing traditional pen-and-paper methods. Combining their local knowledge with technology, the surveyors documented 600 mangrove trees, recording species, diameter at breast height (DBH), height, GPS coordinates, and photos of tree barks, leaves, flowers, and fruits. These parameters are key in determining the carbon potential of each tree. The surveyors collectively earned 40 pesos per tree, providing a form of supplemental livelihood. A total of 48,000 pesos was distributed through two wallet accounts managed by field officers, who facilitated cash withdrawals and ensured transparent payment distribution. By integrating local expertise with technology, the project provided exposure to digital tools and actively involved communities in mangrove conservation efforts."
