        "description": "**üåç The Challenge We're Tackling**\nSince the early 1900s, the Philippines has experienced a devastating decline in mangrove cover, reduced from an estimated 500,000 hectares to around 250,000 hectares today. The widespread conversion of mangrove forests into fishponds has disrupted natural coastal habitats, resulting in reduced biodiversity, diminished ecosystem services, and increased vulnerability to climate change. Local communities face challenges of uncertain land ownership, limited awareness, and exclusion from conservation planning, making restoration efforts difficult despite their importance.\n\n**üìú Our Solution**\nOur solution is the development of localized training workshops that enhance community capacity in mangrove restoration techniques, seedling propagation, and monitoring. We integrate local indigenous knowledge with science-based methods to create visually engaging educational materials that guide and empower communities for long-term conservation success. These workshops also highlight potential economic benefits such as eco-tourism and selling nursery mangrove saplings, creating sustainable incentives for preservation.\n\n**üå± Our Organisation/Community**\nWe are a community-focused, science-driven organization dedicated to protecting marine and coastal ecosystems in the Philippines. Through evidence-based activities such as habitat restoration and community empowerment, we work to safeguard biodiversity while ensuring sustainable livelihoods for local communities. Our initiatives include mangrove rehabilitation, marine protected area management, and citizen science programs that engage local communities in conservation efforts. Oceanus Conservation bridges the gap between research and real-world impact by fostering collaboration with local leaders, scientists, and policymakers.\n\n**üñºÔ∏è See Our Impact**\n![alt](https://gainforest.notion.site/image/attachment%3A8aee7c56-c82c-47f1-a73b-9f528a356799%3A42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-35389366159777600200190959172903893991424.png?table=block&id=1ce94a2f-76b3-8026-8e12-fd294abd257d&spaceId=592f10fa-b2fe-4de7-84d7-d47ef5244493&width=1340&userId=&cache=v2)\n\nüîó **[View Our Hypercert](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/hypercert/42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-35389366159777600200190959172903893991424)**\n\n**üìù What This Hypercert Represents**\nThe BKCF Project: AI/Machine Learning-powered Digital Monitoring of Mangrove Ecosystems is a collaboration between Thinking Machines, Oceanus Conservation, and GainForest, conducted in Bislig, Surigao del Sur, Philippines. Oceanus trained 11 local surveyors to use smartphones for data collection, replacing traditional pen-and-paper methods. Combining their local knowledge with technology, the surveyors documented 600 mangrove trees, recording species, diameter at breast height (DBH), height, GPS coordinates, and photos of tree barks, leaves, flowers, and fruits. These parameters are key in determining the carbon potential of each tree. The surveyors collectively earned 40 pesos per tree, providing a form of supplemental livelihood. A total of 48,000 pesos was distributed through two wallet accounts managed by field officers, who facilitated cash withdrawals and ensured transparent payment distribution. By integrating local expertise with technology, the project provided exposure to digital tools and actively involved communities in mangrove conservation efforts.\n\n**‚úÖ Proof That It's Working**\nOur training programs are increasing wildlife biodiversity and adaptive management through continuous community monitoring efforts. The integration of local knowledge with scientific methods has proven effective in engaging communities for long-term conservation success. The successful documentation of 600 mangrove trees by local surveyors using digital tools demonstrates both the effectiveness of our training and the creation of supplemental income opportunities for community members. These efforts not only support conservation goals but also provide sustainable alternative livelihoods for local communities while building digital literacy and environmental stewardship.\n\nüìÇ **[See Proof of Impact](https://gainforest.app/40367dfcbafa0a8d1fa26ff481d6b2609536c0e14719f8e88060a9aee8c8ab0a?app-tab=layers&site-id=f38677db-71a8-4621-93ea-c000bae7a628&view-0=info&enabled-layers=20-03-2025%20Acevedo,19-03-2025%20Cajes,19-03-2025%20Sotto,19-03-2025%20Sanchez)**\n\n**üí° Join Us in Making a Difference!**\nYour support will expand our mangrove restoration across the Philippines while providing sustainable livelihoods for coastal communities.
