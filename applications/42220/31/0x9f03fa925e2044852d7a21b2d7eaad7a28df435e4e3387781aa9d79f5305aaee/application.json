It's a 50k€ investment (out of which we have funded 15k€  so far from Gitcoin). \nThis particular machine goes into production in Jan 2026, so we aim to be ready to deploy it when it's ready - hence a delay on the initially scope milestones. This machine will not only help us build up our soil, increase water retention & microbial life - it will also produce about 50kw of heat that we can use in our coliving building under development (450m2), making it a carbon negative heating solution.\n\nIn the meantime, we have continued development of the lands, building more water retention infrastructure (we stored 1000m3 so far this year), we are building a mushroom farm (target to go into production this summer), and we are now looking into also adding a spirulina farm.\n",

        "description": "_This project seeks to utilize a gasifier for transforming biomass into biochar, a stable form of carbon that enriches soil health, supports water retention, and fosters biodiversity. Our aim is to produce half a metric ton of charcoal per day, subsequently transformed into biochar for application in our expanding food forest and market garden, ultimately fostering a regenerative agricultural system._\n\n### Background:\n\nSet amidst the rich biodiversity of Alentejo, Traditional Dream Factory (TDF) has established a burgeoning food forest and market garden, supporting the nutritional needs of our community while embodying the Principles of Regeneration and Land Stewardship. The addition of a biochar production system aligns with our goals for sustainable land management, enhanced carbon sequestration, and the promotion of ecological balance.\n\n### Objective:\n\n-   Purchase, transport, and set up a gasifier for biochar production.\n\n-   Produce biochar for application in TDF's food forest and market garden, aiming to enrich soil fertility, improve water conservation, and enhance carbon storage.\n\n-   Produce capacity to apply biochar to our expanded  10-hectares food forest, thereby increasing our self-sufficiency in food production and furthering our contribution to ecological restoration.\n\n-   Research how to issue biochar carbon credits on-chain\n\n-   Producing benefits for all local stakeholders and proving we can create a planet positive DAO governed economy on a local scale\n\n\n### Implementation Plan:\n\n-   Q2 2024: Acquisition and installation of the gasifier.\n\n-   Q3 2024: Training for staff and initiation of biochar production.\n\n-   Q4 2024 - Q1 2025: Application of biochar in the food forest and market garden.\n\n-   Q2 2025: Monitoring and evaluation of biochar's impact on soil health and crop yield.\n\n\n\nWe're super stoked to apply for a grant on behalf of Traditional Dream Factory (TDF) to bring an industrial-scale gasifier to our regenerative co-living village in Abela, Portugal. Our plan is to integrate biochar issuing into our system and collaborate with ReFi protocols.\n\nAt TDF, we're all about creating positive vibes and making a real impact on the environment. With the gasifier, we can turn organic waste into biochar, a super cool carbon-negative material that helps improve soil health and sequester carbon. And by integrating biochar issuing into our token-based system, we can reward our awesome community members for their regenerative efforts.\n\nBut wait, there's more! We're teaming up with ReFi protocols to optimize our DAO's growth and explore new regenerative accounting metrics. We're also studying the possibility of issuing biochar carbon credits, checking out CHAR from Toucan and seeing how we can leverage Puro.earth for this.\n\nWe're also hosting a ReFi hackathon from June 10-14 to connect with experts and explore monitoring solutions and ways to increase water retention on our land, right in between a weekend with Regenesis and one with ReFi Lisboa. Join us there to buidl together!\n\nWith your support, we can make all of this happen. We'll bring the gasifier to TDF, integrate biochar issuing, and strengthen our ties with ReFi protocols. This will not only level up our regenerative practices but also serve as a shining example for other communities looking to do the same.",
