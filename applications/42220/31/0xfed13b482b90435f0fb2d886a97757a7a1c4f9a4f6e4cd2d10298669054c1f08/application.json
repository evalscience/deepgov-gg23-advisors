        "description": "# About the chapter\n\nAs a chapter of the [GreenPill Network](https://greenpill.network/), GreenPill India is committed to converging regenerative digital infrastructure with grassroots efforts in India to drive local outcomes for global problems in coordination. With a population of 1.4 billion, India holds a massive opportunity to unlock the gains from combining coordination mechanisms to drive local outcomes for global problems.\n\n# Who are we\n\nWe are an assembly of ReFi founders, designers, engineers, writers, and web3 enthusiasts who were busy in our rabbit holes until most of us met each other at various points since early 2022 when the book GreenPilled launched the meme of regenerative crypto-economics into the world. While each of us has been striving in our primary role to revive public goods in our projects, in our individual and collective capacity, we have been championing the need to fund, design, develop, and market a future rooted in regeneration.\n\n# Activities\n\n- Throughout the year, we have published educational articles on our online publication [Gulshan](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india) on topics such as:\n\n    -   [navigating challenges for regen founders](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/navigating-regen-movement)\n    -   [the role of inquiry in regen's future](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/role-of-inquiry)\n    -   [inspirations from nature for mechanism design](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/mechanism-design)\n    -   [the legacy of the Chipko Movement in India](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/chipko)\n    -   [key takeaways for India from the GreenPill book](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/programmable-money)\n\n-   June 2024: Establish a partnership with a retainer contract with a local biodiversity farm, [Nature Inspires](https://www.facebook.com/NIChiguruecospace/), based near Bangalore, to drive immersive educational experiences on actionable insights for eco-friendly sustainable living\n\n-   March 2024: Conducted a [half-day community visit](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/farm-visit) to Nature Inspires farm, Chiguru Ecospace, to bridge the world of web3 enthusiasts, builders, and thinkers with the grassroots wisdom of sustainable living.\n\n-   March 2024: Designed and delivered a [2-day workshop on DAOs](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/dao) for faculty at Punjabi University Centre for Emerging and Innovative Technology\n\n-   February 2024: Conducted [workshop on understanding and applying quadratic voting](https://paragraph.xyz/@greenpill-india/qv) for collective decision-making\n\n-   December 2023: Conducted session on [Role of Crypto in Public Goods](https://x.com/Atlantis_p2p/status/1731932427554116074) at [Interfaces](https://lu.ma/interfaces) Unconference at the Indian Institute of Science\n\n# Challenges\n\nOur ongoing challenge is community building. So far, all the activities have been driven by the core team. We are planning to scale the operations using the Impact Miner app, which can reward volunteers and contributors for their actions using the grant funding and, in return, help codify their impact onchain.\n\n# Wins\n\nThe most rewarding part of running the chapter activities is introducing the affordances of blockchain technology to non-crypto audiences and explaining how the Lego blocks stack together for new solutions for some of the most complex challenges, from funding open-source software to climate action.\n\n![](https://paragraph.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fpapyrus_images%2F47b00ad1fad236ffb3294b062f23fcfc.jpg&w=1920&q=75)\n\n# Path Forward\n\nGreenPill India aspires to create spaces where dialogues can flourish and debates can be hosted to bring code and culture together to challenge the status quo and build plural pathways for an equitable future.\n\nThe core team will continue to offer their time for the chapter with no expectation of compensation. We want to enable funding for volunteers and contributors who drive action on the ground. For this purpose, we will utilize the capital allocation workflow using the Impact Miner app from Atlantis.\nWe will continue using residual and new funds raised for the following:\n\n-   Upcoming focus: Expand the core group's subject matter expertise to new community members and enable them to scale independent projects, events, and activities\n-   Use of funds: Cost of logistics to host events. Incentivizing members with relevant skills to own and deliver curated bounties for delivering on chapter priorities using Impact Miner\n-   Type of events: Highly curated in-person experiences to introduce and apply regenerative concepts to fund and thrive public goods in India\n-   Measuring success: Quality of engagement, type of events, and number of artifacts produced as part of our communication and outreach",
