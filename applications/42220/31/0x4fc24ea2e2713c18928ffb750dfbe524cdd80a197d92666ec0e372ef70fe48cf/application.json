          "answer": "This year, ReFi Mexico is focused on creating the conditions for Impact DAOs to emerge across Mexico and LATAM, using Regenerative Finance principles as our north star. Our work centers on expanding the narrative, architecture, and activation models behind Impact DAOs—a class of on-chain infrastructure connecting community action with regenerative economic flows. We're looking to deploy the first smart contracts of the IMM, while contributing to the Celo local stable coin currency adoption. In parallel, we’re simplifying non-technical onboarding for grassroots groups, supporting their transition into tokenized impact measurement, and translating essential “How to DAO” content to make decentralized coordination frameworks more accessible across the region.",
