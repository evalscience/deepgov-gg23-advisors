The first stage of our operations was to successfully start a community and onboard different talents along. This part is set and done, we have established ourselves as one of the more active Web 3.0 communities in Mexico, by having presence with multiple events and collaborating with local initiatives. Not only that, we attended a World-class hackathon and many members of our community won a prize, showing their talent and individual efforts done per each team, plus the interconnection and the power the ReFi Mexico community has.

Our focus is to deliver tangible outcomes while onboarding impact driven communities and help them capture (impact) market capitalizations by design. This creates the natural conditions to tokenize any activity/asset which will hold and represent value of specific climate solutions, enabling specific market industries. Envisioning a future where we can redistribute, regenerate and design a globally interconnected and interdependent society. Bringing new growth opportunities to take down global south inequalities with the use of distributed ledger technologies and new self-sustainable business models along with complementary currencies and open source design.\n\n[![Screen-Shot-2024-03-27-at-05-06-41.png](https://i.postimg.cc/76tQ3NBG/Screen-Shot-2024-03-27-at-05-06-41.png)](https://postimg.cc/k68c9WPq)\n\nMockUp design and Wireframing\n\n\n[![Screen-Shot-2024-03-27-at-05-06-58.png](https://i.postimg.cc/MGMDk8tT/Screen-Shot-2024-03-27-at-05-06-58.png)](https://postimg.cc/XZWFFmRS)\nNFT Minter and Impact Market maker workflow\n\n\n\nFrameworks: \nWhile this is a data driven proof of concept design. We integrate multiple frameworks, since this allows us to share a larger scope with world wide initiatives. In a simple but elegant manner, we use within our design the Economic Donut and Ecological Benefits Framework (EBF). In a way, to be able to share thought structures with bigger and more robust frameworks, which are in a way theoretical reductions for climate and social action. This helps us identify in a fractal structure 9 main planetary needs and 12 social needs, while adopting the EBF semantic structure. Literally obtaining a map to onboard local impact initiatives. \n\n\n[![Refi-NFT-minter.png](https://i.postimg.cc/vZZ4r7QY/Refi-NFT-minter.png)](https://postimg.cc/pp3VxFh4) \n**Our proposal is getting adopted by ReFiDAO** \n\n\n\n\n\n[![meet-up-1.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/1Rj3XhKP/meet-up-1.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/Sjch1P5t)\nMexico City Community mappings 1\n\n\n[![refi-near.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/ZnKcqg1h/refi-near.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/2bMvcHkH)\nMexico City Community mappings 2\n\n\n\nState of the Art:\nAs leaders in the Web 3.0 ReFi space in Mexico, we have enabled community dynamics that helps us experiment with the NFT minter, before it’s an NFT minter, since we have mapped that our community is aiming to tokenize Real World Assets, specially natural products such as: coffee, rain water harvesting, amaranth, up-cycled clothing, cryptoreforestations and more. Therefore we experimented with a regenerative market, to create a real market maker (buyers-sellers) condition. We gathered local impact communities, for them to have product exposure, while we provided with Web 3.0 and crypto exposure, pushing adoption and inviting assistants to download their Wallet and push on-chain transactions, while maybe not being too successful, 15+ people left with wallets and knowing how to transact. Our next experiment is to plan another Regen Market, and this time, mint the products before and make seamless transactions, with chain abstraction. \n\n\n[![IMG-0717.png](https://i.postimg.cc/C1kcWVJ0/IMG-0717.png)](https://postimg.cc/N9G8HSWC)\nEntrance to the Regen Market, our first experimental live marketplace. \n\n\n\n[![IMG-0719.png](https://i.postimg.cc/mk9LKj6J/IMG-0719.png)](https://postimg.cc/hQSRdLn1)\nLocal communities setting up shop: Amaranth and Kombucha\n\n\n[![IMG-0718.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/8cXRn19t/IMG-0718.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/PvZvCktw)\nSorry for the bad picture. IRL Market, Upcycling clothing on the right, Kombucha in the middle and Amaranth on the left. \n\n\n\n[![IMG-0720.png](https://i.postimg.cc/QMDTm9Vj/IMG-0720.png)](https://postimg.cc/87ycPChY)\nExcerpt taken from video: transacting with Bitcoin and Near in the IRL Market. We taught how to download a wallet in seconds and make transactions. It wasn’t such a successful activity as people were mostly relying on cash or debit cards. \n\n\n[![IMG-1058-1.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/4xg6LFSC/IMG-1058-1.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/tYBn7DbD)\nProduct showcase and Live demos. \n\n\n\n[![partners.png](https://i.postimg.cc/fLmWr5PF/partners.png)](https://postimg.cc/MMZ8c0qb)\nCommunities that participated with us that day, having live demos, product showcases, presentations and tech talks.\n\n\nNFT Minter:\nIntegrating Web 3.0 technology goes beyond the code implementation to the Web page, specially when there is a full climate solution framework behind. At this point, we have a mock-up design and wireframing done. Not only that, we have worked on our tokenomics, introducing unique but also well known aspects in the economic space. We this NFT minter we are creating the conditions to fuel the classic formula y=x*z, which allows us to tokenize any type of activity/community/asset. We then help communities deploy their own attestation service based on EBF, and circular frameworks. We add endowments and liquidity pools to enable a regen data/metrics market maker. Tokenize Data and metrics - Creating a new way to socially capture economic value and innovate tokenomics in ReFi. We are creating the foundations of a Public Goods infrastructure with regenerative impact to make on-chain attestations to generate value from off-chain activities. This means a new way to add value to community tokens based on their impact. NFT Minter - Open and inclusive, all-in-one built-in NFT minter. This helps impact communities to capture economic value, and add a “proof of work” as an dMRV, while enabling global collaborations. These are the pillars of the Impact Market Maker. Funding Mechanisms - Recognizing the importance of decentralized donation platforms, such as Gitcoin and Giveth to bootstrap the basics, we integrate other concepts, like endowments and liquidity pools to enable DeFi tools for the ReFi space (ReDeFining the future). R3G3N M3ntorship -   We push offline and Web 2 communities to adopt Web 3.0 technologies and regen habits/activities while integrating built-in frameworks (EBF, ED, E8) for more equitable distribution of humanity’s resources to help balance our complex planetary household through large scale cooperation in societies all around the globe starting in Mexico-Latam. Keep an eye on the memes of productions as hyperstructures (not as financial flash mobs). \n\nOn the road to create the first Impact Market Maker:\nWe envision an Impact Market Maker as a tool to facilitate the trading of impact-driven data, while providing liquidity to that specific market/project/community and dMRV. So We first need to understand that the primary role of a traditional market maker “is to enhance the efficiency and fluidity of the market by quoting both buy and sell prices for a financial instrument.” In a way, we introduce additional layers to the traditional Market Maker, seeking to add these principles to generate social/environmental impact storytellings (turning projects into their own oracle and pushing the dMRV narratives) alongside financial returns. This is how we ReDeFine a data-impact driven Market Maker. Carbon credits? Old fashion. Gamified Impact Market Maker as a meme of production of a hyperstructure is the future. \n\n[![2.png](https://i.postimg.cc/fyW4fKQY/2.png)](https://postimg.cc/LYW0HjXs)\nOur roadmap for 2024\n\n\n[![asesoria-refi.png](https://i.postimg.cc/T1K0xLrZ/asesoria-refi.png)](https://postimg.cc/fShmjbqK)\nAs well we are providing Office hours on ReFi Mexico Metaverse, to push projects implementing Web 3.0 tools from the design of their solutions. \n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nIn just 11 months, our local ReFi node in Mexico City has emerged as a dynamic force driving innovation and sustainability in the Web 3.0 landscape. With a strong community foundation and a track record of impactful collaborations, we are poised to revolutionize the market through our visionary proposal: the development of an NFT Minter to fuel an Impact Market Maker. By tokenizing real-world assets and activities, we're not just redefining market principles; we're reshaping the future. Through integration of frameworks like the Economic Donut and Ecological Benefits Framework, alongside collaboration with local organizations and adherence to ecological guidelines, we're forging a path towards a more equitable, regenerative, and interconnected society. Our vision transcends traditional market mechanisms, offering a bold, gamified approach to social and environmental impact, where carbon credits become antiquated relics of the past and the Impact Market Maker emerges as the beacon of a hyperstructural future.\n\n\n[![R-evolucio-nm.png](https://i.postimg.cc/RhtPfJNw/R-evolucio-nm.png)](https://postimg.cc/ZvTFzRPq)\n\n\n\n\n[![opevnt.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/MG8zj1Hm/opevnt.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/WdSBBFMd)\n\n\nIf you've received funding in past grant rounds, please share any new updates or milestones from the prior months. You can also include the challenges you've faced. \n\nHow do you measure the impact of your project? Please provide examples and/or standard metrics. This might be used in future impact reports:\n\nCertainly, the impact of our project is not confined to traditional metrics like carbon credits. Instead, we are pioneering a decentralized approach to measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) that empowers our community to define and track its own metrics for success with professional guidance. By designing decentralized MRV systems, we are removing the reliance on single points of failure and placing decision-making power back into the hands of the community. For example, we are developing tools and frameworks that allow individuals and organizations to autonomously measure their contributions to sustainability, whether through carbon offsetting, biodiversity conservation, or social impact initiatives. These decentralized MRV mechanisms not only ensure greater transparency and trust but also enable more tailored and context-specific assessments of our project's impact. As we move away from antiquated models like carbon credits, we are paving the way for a more inclusive and resilient approach to measuring and maximizing our collective efforts towards building a regenerative and interconnected society.\n\nAnything else you'd like to share about your project, previous work, or other project affiliations? Anything you'd like to add that may help in determining project eligibility?\n\nIt’s important to mention that we started the Regen Market initiative aligned with ecological guidelines, therefore we have collabed with local organization Angulo Ambiental, receiving both guidance on the process before and during the event, while receiving final feedback after the event as well. We compromise to make more and stronger collabs, to reduce the Web 3.0 events footprint, while providing top quality educational content in the space. \n\n\n[![4.png](https://i.postimg.cc/DZ4VjZSw/4.png)](https://postimg.cc/qhrZgpcP)\n\n\n\n",

          "description": "The NFT Impact Minter is designed to introduce communities to blockchain technology by allowing them to tokenize their impact. This platform empowers individuals and projects to easly create and trade NFTs that represent their positive environmental, social, and economic activities. For the next phase, an impact marketplace will be established to serve as a financial inclusion tool, enabling users to sell their NFTs and access alternative funding. This initiative marks the beginning of a grassroots movement aimed at driving widespread adoption of Web 3.0 technologies powered by Celo.",
          "problem": "Many people are unaware of Web 3.0, regenerative practices, and the potential of blockchain technology brings as a financial inclusion tool. There is a significant adoption barrier due to the technical knowledge required. Impact communities struggle to find funding and face challenges in sustaining their efforts. Additionally, a large portion of the population is unbanked or underbanked, lacking proper financial guidance and often falling victim to scams when approaching the crypto space. ",
          "solution": "Our solution involves introducing Impact NFTs as utility tokens. By mapping impact communities and assisting them in tokenizing their impact in the simplest manner possible, we facilitate online transactions. Following this, we create an impact marketplace where users can sell their NFTs and start capitalizing on their efforts. This approach aims to increase transaction volumes on the protocol, bringing gamified tokenomics while demonstrating real use cases, and drive adoption by pushing the tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWA) backed by an impact market. Our documentation provides detailed guidance on both financial and educational aspects, addressing the needs of these communities comprehensively. We have also been extensively helping the Regen community grow, by bringing entrepreneurial guidance, serving as a ReFi hub where people interconnect, and promote Web 3.0 adoption, bringing builders into our community. \n\nDive in to [refimexico.org/en](url) don't forget to explore our [mirror.xyz/refimexico.eth](url)\n\n",

          "description": "This year, ReFi Mexico is focused on creating the conditions for Impact DAOs to emerge across Mexico and LATAM, using regenerative principles as our north star. Our work centers on expanding the narrative, architecture, and activation models behind Impact Market Makers—a new class of on-chain infrastructure connecting community action with regenerative economic flows. We're advancing this by connecting the frontend and backend of our protocol, deploying the first smart contracts, and contributing to the Celo Mexican Peso mission as a catalyst for local, stable economic exchange. In parallel, we’re simplifying non-technical onboarding for grassroots groups, supporting their transition into tokenized impact measurement, and translating essential “How to DAO” content to make decentralized coordination frameworks more accessible across the region.",
          "problem": "Across Mexico and Latin America, countless grassroots initiatives are generating real ecological, social, and economic impact—but they remain disconnected from meaningful funding, governance tools, and digital infrastructure. Despite the rise of Web3, most communities lack accessible pathways to organize, measure their impact, and participate in regenerative economies. Meanwhile, existing funding systems are extractive, centralized, and often reward visibility over substance. Without localized frameworks, inclusive coordination models, and tools to link action to on-chain value, the regenerative movement remains fragmented and under-resourced.",
          "solution": "ReFi Mexico is building the foundations for a decentralized regenerative economy by designing and activating Impact DAOs—on-chain systems that connect real-world impact with digital value flows. Through a combination of protocol development, field-based experimentation, and cultural protocol stewardship, we enable local communities to form Impact DAOs, organize around shared goals, and access regenerative funding using blockchain tools. By translating \"How to DAO\" resources, supporting the launch of the Celo Mexican Peso, and simplifying non-technical onboarding, we’re creating an accessible, interoperable, and sovereign framework for regeneration to scale from the ground up.",
          "missionSummary": "ReFi Mexico exists to unlock the regenerative potential of communities across Mexico and LATAM by bridging grassroots action with Web3 infrastructure. Our mission is to empower local actors to coordinate transparently, access sustainable funding, and participate in decentralized regenerative economies through the creation of Impact DAOs and the development of inclusive, sovereign market tools like the Impact Market Maker.",

We are developing and adapting a template for the regenerative community marketplace.\n\nSo far, we have onboarded several stakeholders, such as greenhouses, farmers, artists, and more, and we are mapping a network state of impact in Mexico. This will eventually become a full-fledged marketplace (e-commerce) for regenerative products and services. We are building and experimenting with concepts, actions, connecting channels, and regenerative literature to create a comprehensive platform for the community.\n\n**Utilizing the Celo Ecosystem:**\n\n- **NFT Minter and Marketplace:** Our evolving NFT minter and marketplace will be built on the Celo platform, leveraging its blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and scalability.\n[![Re-Fi-minter-00001.png](https://i.postimg.cc/nrCbkcHk/Re-Fi-minter-00001.png)](https://postimg.cc/Fk5BFvkd)\n[![Re-Fi-minter-00002.png](https://i.postimg.cc/50PWLFMy/Re-Fi-minter-00002.png)](https://postimg.cc/xJbZS88V)\n[![Re-Fi-minter-00003.png](https://i.postimg.cc/HWhCL52P/Re-Fi-minter-00003.png)](https://postimg.cc/gr87Sx1v)\n[![Re-Fi-minter-00004.png](https://i.postimg.cc/gjQ9BFjP/Re-Fi-minter-00004.png)](https://postimg.cc/Lgt0nWjy)\n\n- **Tokenomics and Framework Design:** By contributing to the state of the art in tokenomics and framework design, we aim to set new standards for regenerative finance within the Celo ecosystem.\n  - Read more here (don't forget to mint): [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/refimexico.eth)\n  - Check out our [White Paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aTUaVFSvcLJ_LIiKt6X9Z7BQ7SIKJbzDLdpSoh6vdtc/edit)\n  - Explore our [Github](https://github.com/ReFiMexico/NFT-Minter)\n  - Karma: [Gap Karma](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/refi-mexico---building-a-regenerative-community-nft-impact-minter)\n  - Don't forget to visit our [Web page](https://refimexico.org/en)\n\n- **Stakeholder Onboarding:** We have successfully onboarded various stakeholders, including greenhouses, farmers, and artists, to our community, and they are ready to dive into the Celo ecosystem, facilitating their transition to blockchain-based solutions. We have also hosted 3 events featuring the Celo logo as a Quadratic Funding (QF) sponsor for previous Gitcoin rounds. We have experimented with organizing an IRL Marketplace that aligns with our project development and successfully collaborated with over 13 impact communities from different parts of Mexico and the world.\n[![limpieza-cascada-foto-basura-AGBGX9-EKL4c7-P1-Pe.avif](https://i.postimg.cc/C1C0WbFc/limpieza-cascada-foto-basura-AGBGX9-EKL4c7-P1-Pe.avif)](https://postimg.cc/Q9Mv79K7)\n[![winners-huatli.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/y6LDrC7H/winners-huatli.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/CdfMztZP)\n[![ETHCincode-Mayo-Post-para-Instagram.png](https://i.postimg.cc/GpLcDRsM/ETHCincode-Mayo-Post-para-Instagram.png)](https://postimg.cc/fVPn46CX)\n[![ETHCincode-Mayo-Post-para-Instagram-2.png](https://i.postimg.cc/C1MWhCQ5/ETHCincode-Mayo-Post-para-Instagram-2.png)](https://postimg.cc/p970kjxM)\n[![X-Space.png](https://i.postimg.cc/d0jbcNng/X-Space.png)](https://postimg.cc/94z8Gp6B)\n[![1.png](https://i.postimg.cc/zBfcZzyR/1.png)](https://postimg.cc/sBtc5R9V)\n\n- **Network State Mapping:** Our efforts in mapping a network state of impact in Mexico City and beyond are aligned with Celo's mission of financial inclusion and sustainable development.

Bringing together GreenPill Network 1, ReFi DAO 1, Celo Regional DAOs 1 and Regens Unite 1, we aim to support a global movement of regenerative communities leveraging Web3 for real-world impact and addressing local needs. The round will feed into a program to support the further development of local community impact tracking methodologies, grant tooling interoperability, and integrated QF & RPGF. We have currently secured $60K in funding from Celo Public Goods, ReFi DAO and Greenpill and ask for Gitcoin’s backing as we embark on a shared mission to showcase how community coordination, Web3, and innovative financial mechanisms can enable ecological and social regeneration on a global scale.",

We're looking to deploy the first smart contracts of the IMM, while contributing to the Celo local stable coin currency adoption. In parallel, we’re simplifying non-technical onboarding for grassroots groups, supporting their transition into tokenized impact measurement, and translating essential “How to DAO” content to make decentralized coordination frameworks more accessible across the region."

Bringing together GreenPill Network 1, ReFi DAO 1, Celo Regional DAOs 1 and Regens Unite 1, we aim to support a global movement of regenerative communities leveraging Web3 for real-world impact and addressing local needs. The round will feed into a program to support the further development of local community impact tracking methodologies, grant tooling interoperability, and integrated QF & RPGF. We have currently secured $60K in funding from Celo Public Goods, ReFi DAO and Greenpill and ask for Gitcoin’s backing as we embark on a shared mission to showcase how community coordination, Web3, and innovative financial mechanisms can enable ecological and social regeneration on a global scale.",
