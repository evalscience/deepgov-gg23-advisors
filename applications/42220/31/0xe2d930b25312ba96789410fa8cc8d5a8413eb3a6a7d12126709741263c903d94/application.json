By combining innovative waste & sustainable management strategies with the transparency and security of blockchain technology, we intend to contribute to a more sustainable and regenerative future.\nTanzania, like many other regions, faces significant challenges related to waste management and environmental degradation. Improper disposal of waste contributes to pollution, health hazards, and ecological damage. At the heart of it all, Waste pickers are the ones that do all the off-setting however face many challenges such as lack of resources, negative societal stigma, and most importantly exploitation in pay where they receive a mere $0.1 per kilogram of waste! Additionally, the lack of transparent financial systems often hinders sustainable development efforts. Our project addresses these issues by creating a waste regeneration system that not only reduces waste but also provides economic incentives through blockchain-powered finance mechanisms.\nFurthermore, Tanzania's development index is closely tied to energy supply, and with the rapid depletion of non-renewable resources, an energy crisis looms. Over 95% of Tanzanian households rely on firewood and charcoal for cooking, revealing a significant market demand for cleaner energy sources.\n\nProject Solution:\nOur project's core solution involves the establishment of an infrastructure for climate and socio-economic upheaval. Our infrastructure for waste regeneration enables incentivizing regenerators in the form of waste pickers, transforming waste materials into valuable resources and enabling different organizations and businesses to keep track of their impact. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Blockchain, dmrv and efficient recycling processes, we aim to minimize waste accumulation and its negative impact on the environment. \n\n![chatafisha](https://bafybeif5lkfkqrkshqkhmlgtf6aw3oc5rzd2nx6otvmw72i4ooa3wnyihi.ipfs.w3s.link/dApp%20userflow%20copy.png)\n\nWe are also building governance frameworks for marginalized communities that will also be used in preserving these resources transparently as well as enable them to receive alternative means to financing.\n\n[![create-dao.png](https://i.postimg.cc/FztPHN97/create-dao.png)](https://postimg.cc/34BjLM0T)\n\nFurthermore, we integrate blockchain technology to ensure transparent tracking of waste transformation processes and provide financial and governance rewards to participants who contribute to the system.\n\n![chatafisha](https://bafybeif5lkfkqrkshqkhmlgtf6aw3oc5rzd2nx6otvmw72i4ooa3wnyihi.ipfs.w3s.link/dApp%20userflow%20copy.png)\n\nProject Goals:\n- Environmental Regeneration: Reduce waste accumulation, minimize pollution, and promote sustainable resource management through the production and use of eco-products, solar micro-grids in the near future to ensure as much sustainability and climate friendly as possible.\n- Blockchain Integration & Onboarding to Web3 through alternative financing: Implement a secure and transparent blockchain system to track waste regeneration processes, decentralized storage onboard waste pickers to web3 directly and incentivize participants and receive impact certificates.
