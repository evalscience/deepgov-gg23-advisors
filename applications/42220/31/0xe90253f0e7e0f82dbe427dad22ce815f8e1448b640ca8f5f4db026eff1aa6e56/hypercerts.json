Using the Silvi protocol, we’ve planted 20 foxtail palm and coconut trees in Lagos' Mopo Akinlade community to help combat coastal erosion.  \n\n#Olókun is a product of our research at the intersection of climate, agriculture, web3, and regenerative finance(ReFi) in Africa. Here’s a link to the tree planting event https://tinyurl.com/projectolokun, and my ReFi community stories https://blog.refidao.com/author/simon/ \n\n#ProjectOlókun was sponsored by #ReFiDAO and #Celo with HUGE support from #Silvi.Earth"

            "description": "Project OSISI is a ReFi Lagos ecosystem project connecting impact donors to tree-planting events in Nigeria. OSISI Pilot Farm is a 1040-SQM tree nursing garden in Badagry town, Lagos State. It serves as a hub for nursing and distribution of tree seedlings \n\nBy establishing this pilot garden, we've gained valuable insights into several key aspects of the tree nursing business:\n1) Unit Cost Analysis: Understanding the cost of producing tree seedlings is crucial for scaling up tree planting efforts and creating sustainable environmental programs. \n2) Distribution Methods: The pilot has allowed us to test and refine strategies for distributing planting materials and tree seedlings, which can inform future tree planting festivals\n\nCommunity Involvement: Project OSISI enables land stewards to organize tree-planting events in schools and climate-affected communities in Nigeria. OSISI works with coconut farmers in Badagry, empowering them to grow and sell tree seedlings. \n\nScale and Impact: The OSISI Pilot farm employs 3 farmers to nurse tree seedlings. The farm has successfully grown 100 tree seedlings ready to be transplanted.\n\nActivities & Approach: We take pride in our mutual partnership with NGOs and governments. Project OSISI recently secured the approval of Lagos State Government Education Districts to implement tree-planting festivals in 8 schools in Lagos. \n\nQuantifiable Result: OSISI pilot farm sits on a 1040 SQM farmland where we grow tree seedlings and banana/plantain fruits. Project OSISI has planted over 200 trees in schools, recreational parks, and coastal communities in Nigeria\n"
