        "description": "About\nFormosa Art Bank DAO (FAB DAO)\n\nFAB DAO, also known as Formosa Art Bank DAO, is a self-governing organization for charity NFTs since 2021. The largest charity NFT fundraising project in Taiwan, the \"Project Percentage, %\", brought together cross-disciplinary organizations and individuals to create a new system and style in Taiwan NFT market that combines the theme of charity, art and culture.\n\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/projectpercentage\n\nFAB DAO focuses on minting and selling non-profit NFTs, creating artist and collector communities, building blockchain experiences and designing blockchain education for the public.
