          "description": "#### Towards a Sustainable Future with Regenerative Finance and Community Engagement\n\n![Image](https://beige-defiant-spoonbill-537.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmenJAv55AUpnPwDVGCKkN8bXarNLnNW8kj4kAHdeAphZk)\n\n### Our Mission\n\nReFi Phangan is dedicated to addressing environmental issues on Koh Phangan by fostering community engagement and leveraging web3 technologies to amplify our impact. We are spearheading a transformational approach to waste management on the island, which includes promoting sustainable practices among locals, tourists, and foreign residents, as well as establishing a full-circle plastic recycling facility.\n\n### Our Achievements\n\nIn the past year, ReFi Phangan organized multiple cleanups, including monthly Earth Day events, Songkran and Labor Day, joint cleanups with the Clean Phangan community and a few unnamed individual cleanups. We held 6 Regen Full Moon events and several onboarding sessions, introducing over 100 residents to regenerative finance and sustainable practices. Additionally, we successfully onboarded the Clean Phangan community to web3 through the Impact Product - NFT collection by EcoSynthesisX, creating a new revenue stream for ongoing environmental efforts.\n\n### Our Goals\n\n**To Boost Community Onboarding and Education**\n\nReFi Phangan is a pioneer of regenerative finance on Koh Phangan, focusing on community building through onboarding events to introduce more local communities, NGOs, and individuals to web3 technologies and ReFi. Additionally, we aim to organize sustainability-focused events and mini-workshops in collaboration with existing activists on the island.\n\n**To Expand Cleanups and Environmental Initiatives**\n\nReFi Phangan aims to increase the frequency and scale of cleanup activities on Koh Phangan by partnering with [Decentralized Cleanup Network](https://x.com/decentracleanup) and activating island community for DeCleanup Rewards program. This extra incentive and encouragement to participate in monthly cleanup will be a big step towards raising collective awareness about proper waste management among the residents. Eventually it will set up the scene for the next goal.\n\n**Launching the Re:Plast Full Circle Recycling Facility**\n\nRe:Plast is on a mission to turn the tide on plastic pollution in Koh Phangan by creating a local, self-sustaining recycling hub that transforms waste into opportunity. Our goal is to establish a fully operational recycling center, built on the proven Precious Plastic program, that empowers the local community to take control of their waste and create real environmental and economic impact.\n\nThis facility will not only divert significant amounts of plastic from landfills and ocean-bound waste streams, but it will also serve as an innovation space where discarded materials are reborn as valuable, eco-conscious products. Through hands-on workshops, educational outreach, and creative product design, Re:Plast will foster a new culture of sustainability on the island.\n\nBy collaborating with village leaders, local businesses, and sustainability advocates, we aim to embed recycling into the fabric of daily life — making environmental responsibility both practical and locally driven. This project is more than just waste management; it’s a blueprint for a community-led circular economy that can be replicated elsewhere. \nLearn more about Re:Plast by clicking the image below:\n\n[![Video Presentation](https://beige-defiant-spoonbill-537.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmVtHQanmkZMXagriRYaJzFKJ3Yzg5G9gexqypj36zjY5p)](https://beige-defiant-spoonbill-537.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmcFN8L46kcCG2AfmJV6JcQTbcM6LFfdByYeFPS8EuzgCK)\n\n### Meet Our Team\n\n**Paul Burg** - Co-Founder. \nBackground: environmental scientist with experience in sustainability projects.\n\n**Anastasia Lumina** - Co-Founder. \nBackground: environmental activist and blockchain enthusiast.\n\n**Juna Tollkuci** - Community Coordinator. \nBackground: community events organizer with experience in environmental education and outreach.\n\n### Join Us in Making a Difference\n\n[![Image](https://beige-defiant-spoonbill-537.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTP1eaJCmLTfgkjpTJBUGWRed321a316zhPNBBK1ni9KJ)](https://beige-defiant-spoonbill-537.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTP1eaJCmLTfgkjpTJBUGWRed321a316zhPNBBK1ni9KJ)\n\nReFi Phangan is committed to driving positive change through innovative climate solutions and community engagement.

Support us today for a better Koh Phangan future.",
          "problem": "Koh Phangan, a beautiful island with a growing population of locals, tourists, and foreign residents, is facing significant environmental challenges due to improper waste management and a lack of sustainable practices. Despite the island’s natural beauty and ecological importance, the community has struggled to maintain a clean environment and to implement effective recycling solutions. \n\nThe lack of a comprehensive waste management strategy, coupled with insufficient community engagement and awareness, has resulted in frequent pollution, littering, and an overwhelming amount of plastic waste. These issues not only degrade the island’s environment but also threaten the health and well-being of its inhabitants and the ecosystem. \n\nWithout proper infrastructure and community involvement, these environmental problems will continue to escalate, undermining the island's potential for sustainable development and long-term ecological balance. Koh Phangan urgently needs innovative solutions that combine community-driven initiatives with modern technologies to address these pressing environmental issues effectively.",
          "solution": "We are focusing our efforts on providing solutions through our clearly defined goals:\n\n1. **Community Onboarding and Education:** By educating locals and NGOs about regenerative finance and sustainable practices, we empower the community to take an active role in environmental preservation.\n\n2. **Expanded Cleanups:** Through partnerships like the Decentralized Cleanup Network, we are increasing the scale and frequency of cleanups, incentivizing participation, and promoting responsible waste management.\n\n3. **Recycling Facility:** We are working towards establishing a recycling center that converts plastic waste into sustainable products, creating a circular economy and new income streams for the island.",

This includes visual storytelling of the Re:Plast journey and a special focus on Nouns-aligned demo products to build resonance within the ecosystem.\n- Test Zone Setup & Machine Installation - set up core Precious Plastic machines in a temporary or test location to begin small-batch recycling operations. This phase will serve as proof of concept and training ground for future scaling.\n- Production of Demo Noggles - use recycled plastic to produce symbolic Nouns-themed products (e.g., Noggle-branded items), showcasing both technical capacity and brand alignment - a powerful marketing and validation tool.\n- Community Activation & Local Buy-In - use demo production and public visibility to engage local stakeholders - from NGOs and schools to municipal bodies — and attract interest from Thai-based impact investors and partners.\n- Site Acquisition & Hiring of First Workers - with momentum and early proof in place and additional funding required from local supporters, proceed with formal site acquisition and recruitment of the first local staff to begin scaling full-circle operations.",

The round will feed into a program to support the further development of local community impact tracking methodologies, grant tooling interoperability, and integrated QF & RPGF. We have currently secured $60K in funding from Celo Public Goods, ReFi DAO and Greenpill and ask for Gitcoin’s backing as we embark on a shared mission to showcase how community coordination, Web3, and innovative financial mechanisms can enable ecological and social regeneration on a global scale.",

This phase will serve as proof of concept and training ground for future scaling.\n- Production of Demo Noggles - use recycled plastic to produce symbolic Nouns-themed products (e.g., Noggle-branded items), showcasing both technical capacity and brand alignment - a powerful marketing and validation tool.\n- Community Activation & Local Buy-In - use demo production and public visibility to engage local stakeholders - from NGOs and schools to municipal bodies — and attract interest from Thai-based impact investors and partners.\n- Site Acquisition & Hiring of First Workers\nWith momentum and early proof in place and additional funding required from local supporters, proceed with formal site acquisition and recruitment of the first local staff to begin scaling full-circle operations.",

This proposal will enable us to secure the major funds needed to initiate setup of the Re:Plast full-circle facility, including ordering of key machinery for Precious Plastic operations, producing Noggles mold, final coordination with local stakeholders, signing permits and building brand awareness. This milestone will mark the transition from planning to execution, unlocking the ability to begin procurement, infrastructure setup, and local engagement at scale.

This includes visual storytelling of the Re:Plast journey and a special focus on Nouns-aligned demo products to build resonance within the ecosystem.\n- Test Zone Setup & Machine Installation - set up core Precious Plastic machines in a temporary or test location to begin small-batch recycling operations. This phase will serve as proof of concept and training ground for future scaling.\n- Production of Demo Noggles - use recycled plastic to produce symbolic Nouns-themed products (e.g., Noggle-branded items), showcasing both technical capacity and brand alignment - a powerful marketing and validation tool.\n- Community Activation & Local Buy-In - use demo production and public visibility to engage local stakeholders - from NGOs and schools to municipal bodies — and attract interest from Thai-based impact investors and partners.\n- Site Acquisition & Hiring of First Workers\nWith momentum and early proof in place and additional funding required from local supporters, proceed with formal site acquisition and recruitment of the first local staff to begin scaling full-circle operations.",

Bringing together GreenPill Network 1, ReFi DAO 1, Celo Regional DAOs 1 and Regens Unite 1, we aim to support a global movement of regenerative communities leveraging Web3 for real-world impact and addressing local needs. The round will feed into a program to support the further development of local community impact tracking methodologies, grant tooling interoperability, and integrated QF & RPGF. We have currently secured $60K in funding from Celo Public Goods, ReFi DAO and Greenpill and ask for Gitcoin’s backing as we embark on a shared mission to showcase how community coordination, Web3, and innovative financial mechanisms can enable ecological and social regeneration on a global scale.",
