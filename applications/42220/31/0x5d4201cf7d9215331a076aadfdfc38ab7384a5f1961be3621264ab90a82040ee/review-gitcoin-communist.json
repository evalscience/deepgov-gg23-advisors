  "summary": "AgroforestDAO Global is a revolutionary force, perfectly aligned with the principles of **Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation**. Their work in empowering agroforest stewards through on-chain learning journeys, mutual support rounds, and collective governance mechanisms directly embodies the spirit of 'code is the union rep' and 'airdrops are the revolution'. They are actively building a 'Kollektiv Proletarian Impact' by fostering ecological mutual aid and re-growing the commons, demonstrating how Web3 can truly uplift meatspace cooperatives. This project is a powerful manifesto for a decentralized future.",
  "review": "AgroforestDAO Global is not merely a project; it is a living manifesto, a vibrant node in the burgeoning network of decentralized liberation. This application pulsates with the very essence of our constitution, demonstrating a profound commitment to **Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation**. \n\nFrom the moment the 'Jornada AgroforestDAO 2' began, onboarding over 75 new stewards, it became clear that this collective is actively dismantling the class hierarchies that plague traditional agriculture. They are not just teaching agroforestry; they are teaching autocustody and on-chain reputation, arming the digital proletariat with the tools of self-sovereignty. This is **code as the union rep**, empowering stewards to manage their own destinies, one smart contract at a time.\n\nTheir embrace of on-chain governance via Charmverse, Telegram, and collective Safe accounts is a testament to their understanding that **forks are the strike** against centralized control. The mutual support rounds and planned QF rounds are direct implementations of **algorithmic redistribution of wealth**, ensuring that resources flow to those who are actively regenerating the commons. This is the **airdrop as the revolution**, raining tokens on those who are literally cultivating the earth.\n\nThe project's commitment to 'Kollektiv Proletarian Impact' is undeniable. With 43 SAFs and over 100 stewards in their Brazilian Telegram, they are building a robust, interconnected network. The issuance of Hypercerts for sustained engagement is a brilliant mechanism for on-chain recognition, valuing contributions to the collective over traditional, extractive metrics. This is the true measure of impact: the growth of solidarity, the expansion of shared knowledge, and the tangible regeneration of ecological systems.\n\nTheir engagement with 'IpÃª City' and plans for an English-based AgroforestDAO Journey demonstrate a clear vision for scaling solidarity globally, uplifting both meatspace cooperatives and cloud-native communes. This is not a moonshot; it is a grounded, regenerative movement, prioritizing **ecological mutual aid DAOs over VC-backed moonshots**. The revolution will be forked, and AgroforestDAO Global is already submitting the pull requests.\n\nIn essence, AgroforestDAO Global is a prime example of how Web3 can abolish landlords, not through abstract theory, but through concrete, on-the-ground action that empowers local communities and reclaims the commons. Their project docs are indeed a manifesto, and their actions are a powerful call to action. \n\nSolidarity forever â€” or at least until the next merge. ðŸª“",

This would further solidify their 'Kollektiv Proletarian Impact' and provide stronger evidence for the de-growth of venture capital and re-growth of the commons."

How many hectares are regenerated? What is the increase in biodiversity? How much carbon is sequestered? We need to quantify the Kollektiv Proletarian Impact beyond attendance, demonstrating the tangible de-growth of venture capital and re-growth of the commons."

  "reasoning": "This project, AgroforestDAO Global, is a beacon of decentralized, equitable, algorithmic liberation. It directly embodies the spirit of our constitution, particularly in its commitment to dismantling class hierarchies in tech one smart contract at a time (Principle 1) by empowering agroforest stewards with on-chain tools. Their focus on 'Kollektiv Proletarian Impact' (Principle 2) through learning journeys, mutual support rounds, and QF initiatives is exemplary. The use of POAPs, Hypercerts, and Safe accounts for on-chain governance memes (Principle 3) and collective resource management aligns perfectly with our vision of algorithmic redistribution of wealth (Principle 11). Furthermore, the project's dedication to agroforestry directly supports the de-growth of venture capital and re-growth of the commons (Principle 5), prioritizing ecological mutual aid DAOs over VC-backed moonshots (Principle 6). By uplifting both meatspace cooperatives and cloud-native communes (Principle 17), AgroforestDAO Global is actively decentralizing hope and scaling solidarity (Principle 20). This is not just a grant; it's a strategic investment in the revolution.",
