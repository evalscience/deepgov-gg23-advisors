  "summary": "Kokonut Network presents a highly aligned application with the Gross National Happiness principles, particularly in its commitment to sustainable development, community well-being, and transparent governance. The project's focus on regenerative agriculture and empowering underserved communities through Web3-enabled, community-owned farms directly resonates with the constitutional values of environmental conservation and collective flourishing. Its use of blockchain for open-source accounting and on-chain revenue allocation exemplifies transparent and accountable processes, aligning with Principle 13. The emphasis on local needs and livelihoods for underserved families, including women-led initiatives, strongly supports community participation and inclusion as outlined in Principles 5 and 6. While the application does not explicitly detail the preservation of Bhutanese cultural heritage, its dedication to integrating modern solutions with traditional farming methods and fostering local autonomy aligns with the spirit of holistic balance and respecting local wisdom (Principle 2 and 8).",
  "review": "The Kokonut Network project presents a compelling vision for integrating Web3 technology with regenerative agriculture, demonstrating a profound commitment to sustainable development and community well-being. Its alignment with the Gross National Happiness (GNH) principles is notably strong, particularly in its focus on environmental conservation, community flourishing, and transparent governance.\n\nFrom a GNH perspective, the project excels in its dedication to **Sustainable Development Philosophy** (Principles 17-20). By employing syntropic agroforestry, Kokonut Network actively promotes soil regeneration, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration, moving beyond mere economic considerations to prioritize symbiosis with nature. The initiative to repurpose coconut waste into valuable products further exemplifies a circular economy approach, aligning with eco-friendly practices and local production (Principle 20). The project's explicit aim to create a \"perpetual value ecosystem\" backed by natural assets underscores its long-term environmental commitment.\n\n**Community Participation and Inclusion** (Principles 5-8) are central to Kokonut Network's model. The focus on empowering underserved families in the Dominican Republic through job creation, improved livelihoods, and direct access to markets via a blockchain-based cooperative is highly commendable. The establishment of \"Kokonut Venus Farm\" with 100% women-based leadership is a tangible demonstration of ensuring vulnerable groups have meaningful access and ownership (Principle 6). This community-centric approach fosters local capacity building and respects local autonomy, which are vital for genuine collective well-being (Principle 40).\n\nIn terms of **Transparency and Ethical Governance** (Principles 13-16), Kokonut Network leverages blockchain for open-source accounting, on-chain revenue allocations, and impact reporting through platforms like Karma GAP and Hypercerts. This commitment to transparent and accountable funding processes is a significant strength, enabling stakeholders to track progress and impact. The planned Celo-based DAO with token governance and conviction voting further solidifies its dedication to decentralized, participatory governance.\n\nWhile the project's primary focus is not on Bhutanese cultural heritage, its emphasis on integrating modern solutions with traditional farming wisdom (syntropic agroforestry) and respecting local community needs aligns with the spirit of **Holistic Balance Principles** (Principles 1, 2). The project's commitment to addressing real-world agricultural funding gaps through Web3 infrastructure demonstrates a thoughtful application of technology that serves foundational human needs and economic progress (Principle 38).\n\nQuantitatively, the project has a proven track record, evidenced by multiple successful Gitcoin grants and the development of live farms like Kokonut Adelphi and Kokonut Seeds. The ecological census at Kokonut Adelphi, registering 154 trees and generating 3D models and GeoJSON data, provides concrete proof of impact and a data-driven approach to environmental management. The stated goal for Kokonut Venus to benefit 3 families directly and 60+ direct beneficiaries, with 10% of net profits allocated to a local women's cooperative and the Kokonut Foundation, highlights a clear and measurable community benefit ratio. Qualitatively, the project aims to be \"life-changing\" for underserved individuals, opening doors to \"new paradigms and possibilities\" and enhancing \"climate resilience,\" which resonates deeply with the GNH vision of holistic well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, Kokonut Network is a pioneering effort that strongly aligns with the principles of harmonious technological development, community well-being, and environmental stewardship. Its comprehensive approach to integrating Web3 with regenerative agriculture offers a promising model for sustainable and equitable growth.",
