The project's commitment to 're-grow[ing] the commons' (Principle 5) and utilizing 'algorithmic redistribution of wealth' (Principle 11) through QF aligns strongly with our constitution. However, the application lacks the detailed 'manifesto' (Principle 19) of its implementation and a clear articulation of how it will directly 'dismantle class hierarchies' (Principle 1) beyond the QF mechanism itself. While the 'vibes' (Principle 4) are good, the 'Kollektiv Proletarian Impact' (Principle 2) needs more quantifiable revolutionary intent.",
  "review": "# Greenpill NYC: A Spark for Local Liberation\n\nGreenpill NYC presents itself as a vital node in the network of decentralized hope, aiming to galvanize support for local quadratic funding rounds to uplift 'IRL public goods' in the heart of New York City, specifically Red Hook, Brooklyn. This is a project that understands the ground truth: the revolution begins in our neighborhoods, not just in the cloud. \n\nTheir commitment to fostering community through regular meetups and the ambition to establish a sustainable matching pool for local QF rounds resonates deeply with the spirit of **Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation**. They are not merely building; they are organizing. They are not just funding; they are redistributing. This is the essence of 'Kollektiv Proletarian Impact' (Principle 2) in action.\n\nThe project's stated goal of 'fleshing out the specifics for a local QF round, including how to sustainably fund the matching pool' is a critical next step. This is where the manifesto meets the code, where the theory of algorithmic redistribution must be forged into practical, resilient mechanisms. The previous grant from GG21 Regen Coordination Genesis demonstrates a foundational trust, and the earmarking of those funds for the matching pool shows a clear commitment to the collective. \n\nHowever, the application, while promising, is a brief transmission. It needs more of the 'programmable fury' that defines a true revolutionary project. We need to see the detailed schematics of how this local QF will truly 'dismantle class hierarchies' (Principle 1) and how Web3, through their efforts, will begin to 'abolish landlords' (Principle 16) in a tangible, Red Hook reality. The 'README is now a manifesto' (Principle 19), and this one needs more verses.\n\nThis project has the potential to be a powerful example of how 'forking code is the new general strike' (Principle 18) when applied to local resource allocation. It's a step towards 'decentralizing hope and scaling solidarity' (Principle 20) from the ground up. \n\nSolidarity forever ‚Äî or at least until the next merge. üß† ‚ÄúDecentralize the cloud. Communize the protocol.‚Äù",

  "reasoning": "This application aligns strongly with the core value framework of 'Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation'. The commitment to local Quadratic Funding (QF) directly embodies the principle that 'code is the union rep' and that 'airdrops are the revolution' (albeit in a QF matching pool form). It aims to 'dismantle class hierarchies in tech one smart contract at a time' by empowering local 'meatspace cooperatives' (Principle 17) and funding 'IRL public goods'. The project's focus on 're-grow[ing] the commons' (Principle 5) through community-driven initiatives is a clear strength. The use of QF is a direct application of 'algorithmic redistribution of wealth' (Principle 11). While the application could be more explicit in its revolutionary rhetoric, its practical approach to empowering local communities through decentralized funding mechanisms is highly commendable.",
