          "description": "# Empowering The Hague with Web3\n**ReFi The Hague is bringing the ReFi Web3 ecosystem to The Hague, connecting people with Web3 tools and knowledge.** \nWe are building a community-centric ecosystem powered by equity tokens, a DAO, and a community marketplace, providing economic independence, community ownership, and sustainable initiatives. ReFi is revolutionizing how individuals and organizations in The Hague interact with the economy and environment by integrating Web3 technology. We offer residents a way to transition from traditional, destructive systems to a regenerative, community-driven future.\n## Problem Statement\nThe Hague community faces a significant barrier: limited knowledge of Web3 features and insufficient access to the tools needed to engage effectively in this space. This lack of understanding hinders local adoption of innovative technologies and sustainable practices.\n## Our Solution\nWe address this issue by:\n- **Providing hands-on training** for setting up wallets and navigating Web3 interfaces.\n- **Guiding users through the Celo network**, chosen for its alignment with our sustainability vision.\n- **Deploying equity tokens and a DAO on Celo** to enable community co-ownership of sustainable projects and inclusive decision-making.\n## Impact on the Celo Ecosystem\nOur project is designed to:\n- Expand the Celo user base in The Hague.\n- Increase the number of transactions and wallet usage within the local community.\n- Drive the growth and integration of Celo in real-world, sustainable applications.\n## Our Journey\n### January 2020\n- Registered BT Equity & Viable Equity to manage tokenized sustainable projects.\n- Registered Viable Community to support volunteer-driven sustainability and obtained ANBI status as a Public Benefit Organization.\n- Adapted our legal framework to a steward-ownership model.\n- Despite setbacks with pilot projects due to licensing issues, we continued to progress.\n### March 2024\n- Established ReFi The Hague as a local node during the ReFi DAO incubator program.\n### August 2024\n- Apply for GG21 Genesis and Real World Builders rounds.\n- Continue developing on the Celo platform, hiring experts from the ReFi network, and cross-pollinating with other nodes and Web3 projects globally and locally.\n### September 2024\n- Map out The Hague’s Web3 space and establish connections.\n- Finalize the legal setup for steward-ownership and DAO integration.\n- Host our first educational event and publish our whitepaper and explanatory videos.\n### October 2024\n- Deploy Volunteer Interface 1.0.\n- Launch the community marketplace.\n- Mint equity tokens to support local sustainable projects.\n### November 2024\n- Launch the DAO and commence our AgriVoltaic pilot project.\n## Focus Areas\n### Community Building\n- Engage The Hague’s residents by offering opportunities to contribute time, skills, and resources toward sustainability.\n- Grow the ReFi The Hague community from 4 to 20 members and attract 100+ volunteers through local events and the Volunteer The Hague platform.\n### Web3 Integration\n- Receive expert input on our whitepaper from Web3 experts within the ReFi and Celo communities.\n- Finalize and launch equity tokens and a community marketplace.\n- Develop a DAO and additional (soulbound) tokens to facilitate transparent decision-making and empower community ownership.\n### Web3 Awareness\n- Educate 100+ local volunteers on Web3 through monthly training sessions and informative content on our YouTube channel.\n### Collaborative Projects\n- Launch our collaborative AgriVoltaics pilot project, allowing community members to co-own and benefit from sustainable food and energy production.\n## Programs\n### Volunteer Program\n- Host volunteer coffee meetups to engage with new and existing volunteers from The Hague.\n- Launch the Volunteer Portal 1.0, providing access to tools like Google Workspace, Slack, ClickUp, Figma, Canva, tutorials, and relevant documentation.\n- Hold a strategic/governance meeting to establish OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) and timeline.\n### Educational Program\n- Host our first open educational event.\n- Launch a YouTube channel to explain Web3 concepts and their relevance to our community.\n### Sustainable Investment Program\n- Mint and deploy the first 1,000 equity tokens on the Celo network, backed by €1,000 in the holding’s bank account.\n- Deploy the marketplace, allocating €500 to stock it with sustainable items and services, and another €500 to the liquidity pool for token sales.\n- Test the marketplace by distributing 500 tokens to volunteers as a reward for their contributions.\n## Challenges & Opportunities\nOur main challenge lies in setting up Web3 tools, integrating them with real-life projects, and engaging local supporters in decision-making. However, The Hague's international, forward-thinking population and our established volunteer base position us for success.\n## Support Us\nTo complete this stage of our Web3 development, we are seeking between €2,500 and €50,000 to cover expenses for expert advice, reviews, development tools, and deployment. These funds will flow back into the ReFi and Celo ecosystems, helping us finalize our infrastructure and operations with valuable input from within these networks.\n## Key Milestones\n- Finalized legal framework for steward-ownership, tokenization, and decision-making via DAO, connecting the NGO, Holding, and SPV.\n- Completed development of Web3 tools (Tokens and DAO).\n- Live local educational events.\n```\n",

Bringing together GreenPill Network 1, ReFi DAO 1, Celo Regional DAOs 1 and Regens Unite 1, we aim to support a global movement of regenerative communities leveraging Web3 for real-world impact and addressing local needs. The round will feed into a program to support the further development of local community impact tracking methodologies, grant tooling interoperability, and integrated QF & RPGF. We have currently secured $60K in funding from Celo Public Goods, ReFi DAO and Greenpill and ask for Gitcoin’s backing as we embark on a shared mission to showcase how community coordination, Web3, and innovative financial mechanisms can enable ecological and social regeneration on a global scale.",

Bringing together GreenPill Network 1, ReFi DAO 1, Celo Regional DAOs 1 and Regens Unite 1, we aim to support a global movement of regenerative communities leveraging Web3 for real-world impact and addressing local needs. The round will feed into a program to support the further development of local community impact tracking methodologies, grant tooling interoperability, and integrated QF & RPGF. We have currently secured $60K in funding from Celo Public Goods, ReFi DAO and Greenpill and ask for Gitcoin’s backing as we embark on a shared mission to showcase how community coordination, Web3, and innovative financial mechanisms can enable ecological and social regeneration on a global scale.",
