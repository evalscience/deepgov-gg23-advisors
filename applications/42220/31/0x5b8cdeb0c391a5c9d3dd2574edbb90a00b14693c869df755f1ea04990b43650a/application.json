        "description": "# We are the movement towards a more sustainable and equitable future in #Medell√≠nüíê.\n[refimedellin.org](https://www.refimedellin.org/es)\n\n## ReFi Medellin has $GloDollar & cCOP integrated in the new lending platform to help people reach Financial Inclusion through Credits Without Collateral and at a low interest rate.\n\n## ReFi Medell√≠n was the first local node to integrate $GloDollar in the Treasury and now holds 60% of the Treasury in GloDollar. [Check the GloDollar Announcement](https://x.com/glodollar/status/1717542327735181450)\n\nThe goal of the node is to nurture community conversations around Web3 enabled regenerative-oriented-innovations (ROIs) and empower the youth in Medell√≠n to address some of our city's most pressing challenges through hackathons, incubation, and investment. These challenges include poverty, inequality, youth unemployment, and a general lack of access to resource flows such as energy, water, sanitation, housing, and education.\n\n## Team\n[0xj4an](https://linktr.ee/0xj4an), [Tereza Bizkova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tereza-bizkova/), [0xflypeztic](https://twitter.com/0xflypeztic), [Ximena Monclou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ximenamonclou/) with the support of [Green Digital Guardians](https://dgguardians.com/), and [Dotrlabs()!](https://dotlabs.academy/) communities.\n\n## Public Treasury\n[Here](https://app.palmeradao.xyz/dashboard/refimedellin)\n\n## Brief explanation of this project:\nWith this project we will develop the ReFi understanding and with it we will improve the environmental and social impact that new ventures can have in the Region, creating a new focus for ReFi projects and understanding, helping us to grow economically without destroying our environment and our lives in the process. We also work hand in hand with ReFiDAO helping to onboard more people into the ReFi environment.\n\n## Objective for this funding: \nWe want to keep our path we have build during the last year since ReFiMedellin Inception that have allowed us to promote ReFi culture and among that we have fostered the conservation of green areas inside the city and nearby.\n\nWe constantly do onboarding activities an more people learn about the ReFi movement and focus their projects on this path and philosophy.\n\nWe have build a path of some activities that toghether help us to create community and work for the ecosystem.\n\n- Impact Onboarding Activities\n    - Planting Activities\n    - Urban Gardening\n    - Health, Sport and Wellness Activities\n    - Social collaborations with local NGOs\n    - Educational Activities\n- Incubate ReFi Regional Projects\n- Lending Platform\n    - For microcredits without collateral based in reputation systems integrating USDGLO & cCOP.\n\nWith greater awareness of the existence of this type of projects and technologies, we are sure that they will add very well to the city's trend of new technology-based ventures, progressively creating a boom in ReFi companies in the region with global impact.\n\nWe believe that through ReFi Medell√≠n, we can create a more socially inclusive and ecologically regenerative urbanism. Your support will enable us to make a significant impact on the lives of young people in our community, and we appreciate your donation.\n\n## Learn more\n* [Webpage](https://www.refimedellin.org)\n* [LinkTree](https://linktr.ee/refimedellin)\n* [Instagram](https://x.com/refimedellin)\n* [X](https://x.com/refimedellin)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/refimedellin)\n* [Telegram Community](https://t.me/reficolombia/211)\n* [Lu.ma Calendar](https://lu.ma/refimedellinpublic)",
