          "description": "**Mission** \n\nThe mission of ReFi BayArea is to incubate and finance entities committed to regeneration.  More funds are needed for regenerative activities, especially those more critical in the Bay Area. We are focused on substantially increasing these funds.\n\n\n**Context** \n\nStrong forces make the Bay Area a unique and wealthy place. From natural beauty, activism, and art, to hi-tech and world-influence. These forces have mutated into some regrettable outcomes, such as vast suburban sprawls, homelessness, heavy drug use; soil depletion and deforestation, and an overall void in culture and increasing inequality. These contrasts can be turned into symbiotic success.\n\nBy blending a wholistic approach with the current capitalistic system to mobilize resources and strategically allocate them in the fertile soils of regeneration; We are determined to grow capital and contribute to the transition to \"the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible\", at the speed this area and the world needs.\n\nAn anecdote from an event we participated in collaboration with the Street Outreach DAO: “We invited homeless people to join us in the park where we cooked and served pancakes. Some pulled their instruments and livened up the environment with music while one of them showed us Tai Chi. When I said goodbye to an older gentleman I invited, who was having a terrible time sleeping in the street; He made sure I looked into his eyes while he firmly shook my hand, so he could show me how much he appreciated our gesture. It was a great feeling to know that somehow we had given him hope too. \" We are currently seeking housing for him.\n\nThis is one of the types of regeneration we want to focus on. The actions required to tackle these complex problems, such as affordable housing, ending homelessness, and regenerative sustainability for the suburban sprawl affecting the environment, require large investments and high levels of expertise.\n\n\n**Solution**\n\nWe aim to exponentially increase regenerative funding by incubating high-profit margin entities that commit a percentage of their profits to regeneration; Leveraging web3, AI, tokenomics, and incentivizing the community.\n\n\n**Project**\n\nWe are raising funds to embark on a 2-month “Impact Business Campaign” in which our core team, experts in sales, branding, and operations, works to close 10 big-ticket deals in sustainable real estate development, solar energy, regenerative architectural and engineering design. The average commission of these deals is approximately $10,000, which will result in $100,000 in revenue. 20% of the revenue from this Impact Business Campaign, which is $20,000, will be donated toward regenerative activities, consequent campaigns, and funding rounds; Continuously compounding investments into regenerative projects and activities.\n\nEach Campaign culminates with the “Regenerative Treaties”, where the deals will be presented to the public. This event will help the deals gain publicity and exposure and, at the same time, serve as an opportunity to call for regenerative projects and talents to participate in future Campaigns.\n\n\n**Journey**\n\nBeing actively involved in the ReFi space in the Bay area Sunny and Al met in several events such as Funding the Commons/Earth Commons in Berkeley which led to wanting to work together in contributing to the growth of regeneration of the environment, including human society. Camille and Martin, exploring opportunities to make an impact with tech, discovered Al’s idea of creating a reward system to fund regenerative activities. Together, the core team aligned with Refi DAO’s vision of leveraging Web3 technology to address local needs and create real-world impact, and created ReFi BayArea to structure and grow the envisioned reward system.\n\n\n**Key milestone**\n\nAgreement to incubate Atmosphereum, a web3 regenerative impact business network marketplace.\n\n\n**Challenges and opportunities**\n\n* Challenges: The social and environmental needs of the Bay Area are complex and require huge investments.\n\n* Opportunities: The San Francisco Bay Area is known for incubating technology innovations with the most concentrated funding resources and talents. We aim to utilize this wealth of resources and network to build up ReFi Bay Area, making it the epicenter for funding projects that regenerate and sustain our world.\n",

Bringing together GreenPill Network 1, ReFi DAO 1, Celo Regional DAOs 1 and Regens Unite 1, we aim to support a global movement of regenerative communities leveraging Web3 for real-world impact and addressing local needs. The round will feed into a program to support the further development of local community impact tracking methodologies, grant tooling interoperability, and integrated QF & RPGF. We have currently secured $60K in funding from Celo Public Goods, ReFi DAO and Greenpill and ask for Gitcoin’s backing as we embark on a shared mission to showcase how community coordination, Web3, and innovative financial mechanisms can enable ecological and social regeneration on a global scale.",

Bringing together GreenPill Network 1, ReFi DAO 1, Celo Regional DAOs 1 and Regens Unite 1, we aim to support a global movement of regenerative communities leveraging Web3 for real-world impact and addressing local needs. The round will feed into a program to support the further development of local community impact tracking methodologies, grant tooling interoperability, and integrated QF & RPGF. We have currently secured $60K in funding from Celo Public Goods, ReFi DAO and Greenpill and ask for Gitcoin’s backing as we embark on a shared mission to showcase how community coordination, Web3, and innovative financial mechanisms can enable ecological and social regeneration on a global scale.",
