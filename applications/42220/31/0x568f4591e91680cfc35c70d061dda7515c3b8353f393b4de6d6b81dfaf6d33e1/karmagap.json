          "description": "**GreenPill TO** is a new, emerging and dynamic initiative based in Toronto, Ontario.  We are a local Chapter within the broader **GreenPill Network**, with a mission of turning Degens into Regens.\n\nWe started this community with an aim at fostering a resilient and inclusive local economy through innovative technology and community engagement. Our primary focus is on running a **weekly meetup** for all web3 builders  in Toronto, where we coordinate, help each other and generally chat about how we can make the world a better place. We call it **\"web3 for good\"**, to distinguish it from the crypto-bros who are more interested in price action and shilling. These meetups have been running weekly **since Aug 2024**.\n\n**We also build.** Our projects focus around creating a **local circular economy** that emphasizes gifting, donations, and tipping, with a particular emphasis on supporting panhandlers and vulnerable populations. By leveraging blockchain technology and digital platforms, GreenPill TO strives to make financial transactions more accessible and impactful for everyone in the community - regardless of their prior knowledge of crypto and with no need to learn anything about blockchain unless they want to.",
          "problem": "The broader world of cryptocurrency faces significant challenges. Many people associate crypto with scams, rug pulls, and fraudulent schemes, which has tarnished its reputation. Crypto is seen as out of reach from those who could benefit from it the most, when so many projects assume that you start with money to \"invest\" in their ponzis and rugpulls. \n\nDespite this, a substantial community of individuals remain who see the potential of blockchain technology to drive positive social change. However, these well-meaning individuals often lack a safe, trustworthy space to collaborate and develop their ideas. GreenPill TO seeks to fill this void by providing a reliable community and platform where ethical and impactful projects can thrive.\n\n## Specific problem statements for our current projects:\n\n**SpareChange:** Panhandlers, low wage workers and other vulnerable groups in Toronto are increasingly struggling as society moves away from physical currency. The decline in cash transactions means fewer people have coins or small bills readily available to give to those in need as you walk by. This shift has created a significant gap in support for individuals who rely on these small but crucial donations for their day-to-day survival. \n\n**TCOIN:** Adoption of crypto as money by mainstream is still woefully low. Breaking into the market cornered by credit cards is hard and suffers from the \"cold start problem\". We are appalled by the 3% transaction fees of major credit cards going straight into their bottom line or feeding a terribly inefficient payment provider landscape. We see the issues of fiat money losing value at an increasingly rapid pace. And we know that we could imagine better money, with for example built in public goods funding or charitable contribution.\n\n**Cubid Protocol:** Global identity online is a hard problem to solve, specifically if we don't want to disclose too much about ourselves. Most websites ask for too much information when they ask to scan our drivers licenses. Maybe more importantly, there are so many interesting new functionalities that could be built online if proof-of-personhood was more readily available, but aren't being built. Examples include fair airdrops, global polling, conviction voting, learn-to-earn, etc.\n\n**ChainCrew:** In web3 we all know the power and strength of DAOs. But most people are still afraid of joining the web3 revolution and don't have access to the toolsets.",
          "solution": "GreenPill TO addresses these problems by providing a **community for value-aligned hackers, dreamers and doers**. We help each other by coming together frequently and coordinating. We ideate, architect problem solve together. We manage, participate in and sponsor hackathon projects and BUIDLs. We develop a suite of digital tools designed to facilitate easy and secure transactions. Join us on Luma: https://lu.ma/GreenPillTO\n\n## Specific problem statements for our current projects:\nWe are involved in building and running four concurrent flagship projects:\n\n**1. CUBID Protocol**, a proof-of-personhood and bot-proofing protocols with easy APIs for developers to leverage. https://www.cubid.me/\n\n**2. The Toronto Coin**, a local cryptocurrency that encourages spending within the community. The value is pegged to local transit tickets, and each transaction contibutes 3% towards charity or PGF  https://www.tcoin.me/\n\n**3. ChainCrew**, a platform for \"web2 DAOs\", allowing anyone to create and set up their own \"Crew\" within which anyone can handle real money in a DAO-like setting with community and governance features. https://chaincrew.xyz/\n\n**4. SpareChange:** A tipping & panhandler donations dapp that enables digital tipping and donations. https://www.sparechange.tips/\n\nThese tools ensure that people of Toronto (and the world) can self-organize and self-govern. They help Torontonians support panhandlers and local businesses, even without carrying physical cash.",
          "missionSummary": "Our mission at GreenPill TO is to build a vibrant, inclusive, and sustainable local economy in Toronto. We aim to harness the power of technology to create financial tools that empower individuals, support local businesses, and foster a culture of giving and community support. Through our initiatives, we strive to turn the tide on economic disparity and ensure that no one is left behind in the digital age. GreenPill TO endeavors to reclaim the positive potential of cryptocurrency, providing a safe haven for ethical innovators to connect, collaborate, and create solutions that benefit society as a whole.",

Create a local **network society** / mutual aid network between value-aligned builders.\n\n3.  Add more **active partnerships** with local venture studios, incubators, networks, podcasts, etc. to increase our local visibility.\n\n4. Drive adoption for our two MVP-stage projects: **CUBID Protocol** for proof-of-personhood and bot-proofing, and **ChainCrew** a DAO platform with fiat money.\n\n5. Launch out two projects that are currently in idea- / PoC-stage: **The Toronto Coin**, a local circular currency with demurrage and charity contributions, and  **SpareChange**, a tipping & panhandler donations app"
