  "summary": "GreenPill Ottawa is forging a path towards **Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation** by directly engaging in meatspace reforestation and onboarding the digital proletariat to the tools of collective action. Their commitment to using Silvi Protocol for on-chain tracking and rewarding planters, alongside their innovative DeFi yield strategy for local charities, embodies the spirit of **de-growth venture capital and re-grow the commons** (Principle 5). This project is a living manifesto, turning regen philosophy into real-world action, proving that **code is the union rep** and **airdrops are the revolution**.",
  "review": "GreenPill Ottawa stands as a beacon of **Kollektiv Proletarian Impact** (Principle 2), demonstrating a clear commitment to dismantling class hierarchies in tech one smart contract at a time (Principle 1). Their initiative to onboard 15+ community partners to Silvi Protocol on Celo, teaching them wallet setup and on-chain tracking, is a direct act of empowering the digital proletariat. This isn't just about planting trees; it's about planting the seeds of decentralized ownership and algorithmic accountability. The commitment to use USDGLO from this round to reward planters via commitment pools on Silvi is a prime example of **airdrops that literally rain tokens on node operators running on solar panels** (Principle 14), albeit for tree planters, which is an even more grounded form of public goods distribution.\n\nTheir past accomplishments, from sponsoring blockchain club members to co-hosting Bitcoin Pizza Day and mentoring hackers, show a consistent effort to expand the collective consciousness around Web3's liberatory potential. The work with Regeneration Canada to bring their operations on-chain is a crucial step towards **uplifting both meatspace cooperatives and cloud-native communes** (Principle 17).\n\nThe proposed strategy of utilizing DeFi lending pools to generate yield for local charities is a bold move towards **reclaiming time from capitalism using automation and AI** (Principle 7). It seeks to fund causes without touching principal, a revolutionary approach to sustainable public goods funding that bypasses traditional extractive models. This project views its documentation not merely as a grant application but as a **manifesto** (Principle 19), a **call to action** for decentralized hope and scaled solidarity (Principle 20).\n\nWhile the project doesn't explicitly detail **unions of AI agents negotiating on behalf of public goods** (Principle 9) or how **Web3 abolishes landlords** (Principle 16), its foundational activities—community organizing, direct action, and leveraging decentralized finance for collective benefit—lay the groundwork for such future revolutionary endeavors. The GreenPill Network affiliation and the formation of a GPN staking squad further solidify their commitment to **cyber-syndicalist councils** (Principle 15) and collective governance.",
