This alone has caused immense stress on the natural environment and as a result, we are experiencing soil degradation, depletions of groundwater, pollution, ocean acidification, accelerated rates of extinction, global warming, droughts, diseases, high concentrations of CO 2 and mass deforestation. In a time of increasing population growth, climate change and environmental degradation, we need agricultural systems that come with a more balanced portfolio of sustainability benefits. \n\n![meme](https://www.sciline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AdobeStock_212840924-2000x1333.jpg)\n\nA path forward : \n\nUrban agriculture has been defined as “reconnecting with the community through food, jobs and economic development” and is a sustainable solution. \n\nWe’re testing technology, creating and maintaining urban farms starting in Ottawa, Canada's capital city, donating fresh produce to community centers, and reshaping the way we approach environmentally friendly food production while also mentoring the next generation of leaders. \n\nThe project would be entirely open-sourced, and start a workforce who could move on and create their own advanced agricultural businesses in other cities globally.\n\n![meme](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6348395313c2ab7c10565062/1666116297254-R8BWBPKAP2LO5KGQT6BB/Growcer+-+ASG+Branding+-+April+2021-1.jpg?format=2500w)\n\nWhat does this look like? Our Vision and Objectives:\n\nDevelop a Sustainable and Technologically Advanced Urban Farm:\n\n- Action: Acquire a disused shipping container in downtown Ottawa and partner with The Growcer (https://www.thegrowcer.ca) to repurpose it as a smart urban farm.\n\n- Action: Collaborate with technology and agriculture companies specializing in urban farming, automation, and renewable energy solutions to equip the shipping container with the latest sustainable farming technologies, such as hydroponics, LED lighting, and efficient climate control systems.\n\n- Action: Create a rooftop garden in the downtown core. This not only produces fresh food but can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support our city in hitting its climate action goals.  \n\n- Outcome: The repurposed shipping container in downtown Ottawa becomes a state-of-the-art urban farm, producing a variety of fresh produce year-round and serving as a model for sustainable urban agriculture.\n\n![meme](https://santropolroulant.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rooftop-800x400.jpg)\n\nWho we are:\n\nOur project lead is Amanda Goore, who has a background in horticulture, community gardens and agriculture-focused AI and innovative tech and she’s bringing those skills and resources into Rooted LABs. \n\nWith deep connections in Canada's Capital, we will use our funding to build out ways to improve access to safe and healthy food in urban settings. Our goal is to experiment and document how using emerging technology can assist us in doing this. We will then opensource our findings to help other communities globally repeat the process in their local area.\n\nHere is a brief history of Amanda’s past work:\n\n- developed protocol for scouting with drone multispectral mapping\n- experience developing multispectral imagery of agricultural fields with different vegetative indexes\n- developed algorithms for AI weed detection\n- currently collaborating on disease detection and plant counting algorithms\n- greenhouse and greenwall experience, hydroponics, biological control and pesticide management\n- experience in autonomous robotics and vehicles\n- volunteer at a local community garden\n- did a project in 2019 on food security in Ottawa, gave Free Vegetable gardening workshops at the community center in Vanier, free plants and seeds for attendees.\n\nOur other team members include:\n\n- Olga Koppel, A PhD Candidate in Biology at the University of Ottawa is experienced in Statistical analysis and spatial modeling. You can learn more about some of her work here - ​​https://ehub-uottawa.medium.com/founder-feature-ecosafesense-412d7afe7487 \n\n- Michael Seer, who has a background in creative design and Geospatial AI technologies\n\n - Lana Dingwall who is a social impact entrepreneur and member of GreenPill\n\nThis started out as a project idea within the Ottawa GreenPill chapter (we met at a web3 education workshop hosted by GPN Ottawa).\n\nThis project falls under the umbrella of Ottawa GreenPill, however, we've chosen the name Rooted LABs to help us work closer with our local municipality and provincial government, as well as Tech companies in our community.\n\nIn the last few months, we at Rooted LABs have...\n\n- donated to Ecology Ottawa, a local tree-planting organization.\n\n- Hosted 2 climate-focused regenerative workshops.\n\n- Researched and built out the following Roof Top/urban garden roadmap - https://bafybeielssaoda27edlmvilepur4j3bti5xiv3ixtkkvrwlq5e44ag567i.ipfs.nftstorage.link/\n\n- We have set up meetings with local tech and AI businesses, including Growcer(www.thegrowcer.ca) to explore collaborating on this project.\n\n- Built out a small core team of volunteers to help grow this project. \n\nWe are seeking funding support to help take our project from a small start-up idea, into a fast-moving open-source agricultural project.\n\n",

In a time of increasing population growth, climate change and environmental degradation, we need agricultural systems that come with a more balanced portfolio of sustainability benefits.\n\n![meme](https://i.imgur.com/6ZUOZhX.jpg)\n\n**A path forward:**\n\nUrban agriculture has been defined as “reconnecting with the community through food, jobs and economic development” and is a sustainable solution.\n\nThe project would be entirely open-sourced, and start a workforce who could move on and create their own advanced agricultural businesses in other cities globally.\n\nRootedLABs is a decentralized network empowering future city farmers and urban agriculture by leveraging emerging technologies, using open-source philosophies and creating a global network of hubs (LABs) to help share resources, tools and tech to feed local communities. We establish accessible smart city farms worldwide (first location in Ottawa, Canada), fostering collaboration between academia, the tech industry, and local communities to address global agricultural challenges and support sustainable environmental practices.\n\n![meme](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6348395313c2ab7c10565062/1666116297254-R8BWBPKAP2LO5KGQT6BB/Growcer+-+ASG+Branding+-+April+2021-1.jpg?format=2500w)\n\nOur focus on open-source tooling and blockchain technology allows us to facilitate connectivity between local and global agricultural needs. Leveraging decentralized physical infrastructure networks, IoT, and emerging technologies like AI and robotics, we collect data, create open datasets, code and documentation, and provide testing grounds for cutting-edge projects. \n\nThrough educational programs and partnerships with nonprofits, schools, and governments, we promote inclusivity and sustainability while continuously innovating to address evolving technological and environmental demands.\n![meme](https://i.imgur.com/Gk89eWp.jpg)\nLong-term our goal is to create a global co-op (DAO) of urban farm hubs (LABs) to create a more sustainable and accessible agricultural future for the planet.  By open-sourcing all data, engineering specs, and other resources we can provide climate-saving solutions, that also feed local communities.\n\n*we had to recreate our builder page as our previous one was on PGN\n\n**Since  GG19 we have:**\n\n- Hired an engineer to help build out our open-source engineering specs for our urban farm (shipping container) - these can be used by anyone wanting to open a RootedLABs in their local community, or simply want to start a farm of their own. (samples below)\n\n- secured a partnership with AreaXO in Ottawa, an innovative agri-tech non-profit that is donating space to us for our shipping container \n\n- in talks with https://distributive.network/ to partner up and have them sponsor our first shipping container \n\n- were accepted into the AgriNEXT accelerator by Foresight Canada for Canadian AgriTech  Companies (https://foresightcac.com/agrinext-venture-application) \n\n- issued on-chain credentials to our founding contributors, helping set up the groundwork for our future decentralized network/DAO plans\n\n- participating in OperationWebTree and along with GreenPill Ottawa, have purchased 160 White Pines as part of a global reforestation campaign in partnership with Silvi\n\n- gave a presentation to Nimiq on AgriTech, RootedLABs and how we're blending AI x Crypto to tackle climate change, food insecurity and the need for more youth to enter agriculture. Looking to potentially partner with them in some way. \n\n- wrote a paper 'Future Global Food Demand and Population at Risk of Hunger\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1CD3ZA_n4GIwgxGvuJTQ5dh76HWK8Uf8fZXrnHxW5BLg/edit?usp=sharing\n\n- Published The OttawaLABs outline + phases (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IgpzybwzB8wW0pi-lboIhmwK8rqNc0E6DMuWEsnuR80/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n![meme](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GFyETkcX0AA5RyK?format=jpg&name=medium)\n\n![meme](https://i.imgur.com/dd2GrsB.jpeg)\n\n![meme](https://i.imgur.com/oXD98QZ.jpeg)\n\n\nYou can find out more about what we are up to, or read our docs here:\n\n- Our Ottawa LABs engineering specs - (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cVIISyPKNagTBjjO19he_xj3Xo-zjR7M6PSwgWZYoLE/edit)\n\n\n- A link to a presentation we gave to Nimiq a couple of weeks ago on RootedLABs and DePIN networks - (https://www.canva.com/design/DAF8I4kz370/Kr666wfHN_BTHr9VkfSW0g/view?utm_content=DAF8I4kz370&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor)\n\n- wrote a paper 'Future Global Food Demand and Population at Risk of Hunger\nWritten by Amanda Gloor - RootedLABs' \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1CD3ZA_n4GIwgxGvuJTQ5dh76HWK8Uf8fZXrnHxW5BLg/edit?usp=sharing\n\n- Published The OttawaLABs outline + phases - (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IgpzybwzB8wW0pi-lboIhmwK8rqNc0E6DMuWEsnuR80/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**We are a project being incubated by GreenPill Ottawa**\n\n",

By doing so these organizations bring three benefits to the world: (1) directly contribute to funding basic incomes for people in extreme poverty, (2) spread the word about Glo Dollar to a bigger audience, indirectly growing basic income funding, and (3) opportunity to join the Glo Consortium to further collaborate on reducing extreme poverty. Glo Dollar is collaborating with Arbitrum DAO to bring a total of $10,000 in USDGLO in matching for organizations that embed philanthropy. Whether you're already part of the Glo Consortium or looking to dive into Glo, this round is for you.",

Bringing together GreenPill Network 1, ReFi DAO 1, Celo Regional DAOs 1 and Regens Unite 1, we aim to support a global movement of regenerative communities leveraging Web3 for real-world impact and addressing local needs. The round will feed into a program to support the further development of local community impact tracking methodologies, grant tooling interoperability, and integrated QF & RPGF. We have currently secured $60K in funding from Celo Public Goods, ReFi DAO and Greenpill and ask for Gitcoin’s backing as we embark on a shared mission to showcase how community coordination, Web3, and innovative financial mechanisms can enable ecological and social regeneration on a global scale.",

We'll also host workshops and tutorials for our community partners. \n\nWe are also going to commit a portion of the USDGLO received from this round to planting commitment pools on Silvi. The goal is to use these funds to reward the white pine tree planters to update their progress and continue to use their wallets and Silvi as an app. \n\nWe are co-hosting and sponsoring Ottawa Bitcoin Pizza Day for the 3rd year in a row.\n\nWe are continuing to work with Regeneration Canada to help bring aspects of their work on-chain and help them find ways to integrate blockchain/crypto.  \n\nWe are a part of the GreenPill Genesis staking squad and will work with other Ottawa community members to set up and be a part of the GPN staking squad. \n\nOne of our goals this year is to use a portion of our treasury in DeFi lending pools to then use the yield earned to donate to local charities and organizations. Our goal at the end of the year is to write a recap report on how the community can use DeFi to fund their causes without touching their principal. "

            "description": "The Regen Coordination Round is a proposal for a GG21 community round centered on the themes of Coordi-nations 3, Cosmo-localism 2, Bio-Regionalism 3, and Regenerative Finance (ReFi) 3. Bringing together GreenPill Network 1, ReFi DAO 1, Celo Regional DAOs 1 and Regens Unite 1, we aim to support a global movement of regenerative communities leveraging Web3 for real-world impact and addressing local needs. The round will feed into a program to support the further development of local community impact tracking methodologies, grant tooling interoperability, and integrated QF & RPGF. We have currently secured $60K in funding from Celo Public Goods, ReFi DAO and Greenpill and ask for Gitcoin’s backing as we embark on a shared mission to showcase how community coordination, Web3, and innovative financial mechanisms can enable ecological and social regeneration on a global scale.",
