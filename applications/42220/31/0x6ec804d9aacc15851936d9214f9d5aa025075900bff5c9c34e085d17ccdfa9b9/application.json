We'll also host workshops and tutorials for our community partners. \n\nWe are also going to commit a portion of the USDGLO received from this round to planting commitment pools on Silvi. The goal is to use these funds to reward the white pine tree planters to update their progress and continue to use their wallets and Silvi as an app. \n\nWe are co-hosting and sponsoring Ottawa Bitcoin Pizza Day for the 3rd year in a row.\n\nWe are continuing to work with Regeneration Canada to help bring aspects of their work on-chain and help them find ways to integrate blockchain/crypto.  \n\nWe are a part of the GreenPill Genesis staking squad and will work with other Ottawa community members to set up and be a part of the GPN staking squad. \n\nOne of our goals this year is to use a portion of our treasury in DeFi lending pools to then use the yield earned to donate to local charities and organizations. Our goal at the end of the year is to write a recap report on how the community can use DeFi to fund their causes without touching their principal. ",
