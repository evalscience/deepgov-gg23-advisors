          "answer": "Our Red Hook coalition started 2025 off with a bang, continuing our work from 2024 to advocate for our community and the Brooklyn Marine Terminal site, 122 acres of waterfront land that the NYC Economic Development Corporation is attempting to deliver to luxury real estate developers. https://edc.nyc/project/brooklyn-marine-terminal \nThrough research, education, flyering, organizing, meetings, webinars, information sessions, workshops, town halls, film screenings, protests and more, we have taken the initiative and activated our community to resist development of unnecessary luxury housing units on Brooklyn’s last working waterfront - Red Hook. \nWe do not oppose development, but we do object to irresponsible and disrespectful design decisions such as building housing towers in a flood zone and further marginalizing existing communities which have been neglected and sidelined by NYC for decades, dating back to the time of Robert Moses and beyond.  \nWe have amplified underrepresented groups, united voices of nonprofits, activists, business owners, city council members and community members, and rewoven the fabric of neighborhoods which have experienced challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, lack of transportation, gentrification, and flooding. We have coalesced as a united group and developed the Voices of the Waterfront website to share activities and updates, directly countering NYC EDC’s efforts to leave people out of this extremely important process which will influence New Yorkers for generations to come. voicesofthewaterfront.com\nWe have spoken and we have listened - to each other. We believe that the Red Hook community knows what is best for us. We support a modern working waterfront that will benefit not only Red Hook but the entire borough of Brooklyn and all of New York City. \nOur activities in recent months can be viewed on our Karma GAP project here: https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/refi-red-hook?tab=updates\nWe have collaborated as a community to develop 7 foundational principles for the Brooklyn Marine Terminal development. These principles are currently under review from the group and we will share updates as they are finalized. In brief: \n1. We want a resilient, thriving green port that serves our community and the region well, now and into the future.\n2. We want this port to operate as a public good, financed using similar models to those that sustain other vital public assets.\n3. We want investment that prioritizes neighborhood infrastructure and NYCHA before accommodating new market rate tenants.\n4. We want equity, revenue and profits to stay local through jobs, small business and other programs.\n5. We want a plan that integrates well with existing local and regional plans.\n6. We want all applicable state, federal, and local laws, frameworks, and codes to be followed.\n7. We want true community participation to be honored in the planning process, and we want our planning efforts to be supported by local and regional experts.\nOur primary goal for Q2 2025 is to resist the NYC Economic Development Corporation's inadequate proposed plan to develop the Brooklyn Marine Terminal (BMT) site in Red Hook. We are galvanizing the community and advocating to the BMT Task Force toward this end. \nOnce we shut down the currently proposed EDC plan and receive more time for the planning process, we will continue to organize and collaborate as a community to develop a comprehensive beneficial BMT plan which adheres to and honors the 7 principles listed above. \nIn addition to these primary goals, in 2025 we plan to engage in the following: \n- host 3 web3 onboarding workshops for the Red Hook community \n- host 2 regenerative finance workshops for the Red Hook community \n- host regular (weekly or biweekly) community cleanups around the waterfront in Red Hook \n- explore decentralized governance possibilities and share them with Red Hook community (such as creation of a DAO) \n- host monthly water workshops led in collaboration with water artist and activist Betsy Damon \n- unite local water organizations such as Resilient Red Hook, PortSide NY and RETI Center through events and shared technology  \n- support Resilient Red Hook's initiatives (https://www.resilient-red-hook.com/) especially participation in the Rise to Resilience coalition (https://rise2resilience.org/)\nIt has been a great joy and honor to participate in grassroots organizing, to experience the tenacity of community, and to uphold the legacy of Red Hook as a historical maritime powerhouse, a haven for artists and creatives, a melting pot of diversity, and a neighborhood on the waterfront. \nThank you for your time, attention, and participation in the story of Red Hook, Brooklyn. We are very grateful. ",
