Bringing together GreenPill Network 1, ReFi DAO 1, Celo Regional DAOs 1 and Regens Unite 1, we aim to support a global movement of regenerative communities leveraging Web3 for real-world impact and addressing local needs. The round will feed into a program to support the further development of local community impact tracking methodologies, grant tooling interoperability, and integrated QF & RPGF. We have currently secured $60K in funding from Celo Public Goods, ReFi DAO and Greenpill and ask for Gitcoin’s backing as we embark on a shared mission to showcase how community coordination, Web3, and innovative financial mechanisms can enable ecological and social regeneration on a global scale.",

Through this grant, we successfully:\n\nDefined and structured the platform’s core milestones\n\nDeveloped smart contract logic for peer-to-peer lending on Arbitrum One\n\nBuilt a frontend interface enabling wallet connection, investment, and repayment tracking\n\nCreated a sustainable business model focused on real-world impact in high-remittance regions like Kenya, Nigeria, and Colombia\n\nDrafted a pitch deck and project documentation for scaling and partnerships\n\n\n\n---\n\nExperience Working on the Grant\n\nWorking on this grant has been both challenging and rewarding. It involved:\n\nDeep research into cross-border finance, local stablecoins, and DeFi lending models\n\nCoordinated team collaboration across tech and strategy domains\n\nFast iteration to meet hackathon and prototype deadlines\n\nExposure to Layer 2 ecosystems like Arbitrum and user needs in emerging markets\n\n\nThis process helped sharpen our technical, UX, and business strategy execution under tight timelines.\n\n\n---\n\nPotential Impact\n\nBorderless Yield can redefine how remittances work—turning them from one-time transfers into long-term investments.\nThe platform has the potential to:\n\nEmpower local entrepreneurs with access to affordable, stablecoin-based capital\n\nGive diaspora communities new tools to support their home countries while earning\n\nReduce reliance on exploitative middlemen in traditional remittance and loan systems\n\nExpand financial inclusion through DeFi in underbanked regions\n\n\nWith continued development and partnerships, this project could significantly improve access to capital, drive local innovation, and build cross-border economic bridges.",
