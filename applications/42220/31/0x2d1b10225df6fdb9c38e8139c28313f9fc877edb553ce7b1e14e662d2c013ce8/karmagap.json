Bringing together GreenPill Network 1, ReFi DAO 1, Celo Regional DAOs 1 and Regens Unite 1, we aim to support a global movement of regenerative communities leveraging Web3 for real-world impact and addressing local needs. The round will feed into a program to support the further development of local community impact tracking methodologies, grant tooling interoperability, and integrated QF & RPGF. We have currently secured $60K in funding from Celo Public Goods, ReFi DAO and Greenpill and ask for Gitcoin’s backing as we embark on a shared mission to showcase how community coordination, Web3, and innovative financial mechanisms can enable ecological and social regeneration on a global scale.",

                "reason": "## Overview\n\nWe recently held a Citizens Round to recognize past and ongoing contributions to Greenpill Nigeria and the African ReFi (Regenerative Finance) space. The round involved three council members who allocated 1,000 points to six candidates. The round used the Easyretro PGF platform, with applications open from September 27 to October 5. After reviewing submissions, council members voted between October 7 and October 11, and the final results were announced during an [XSpace](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1MnGnDrrAEoxO) event on October 18.\n\nRound operators: Amio and Izzy\n\n## Objective\n\nThe round aimed to:\n\n- Reward valuable contributions to Greenpill Nigeria and ReFi initiatives.\n- Set clear goals and intentions for future projects.\n- Gather insights from the council on community priorities.\n- Educate badge holders for future participation.\n\n## Execution\n\n### Pre-Round Preparation\n\nWe initiated a call for volunteers through our Telegram platform, inviting individuals to serve as council members. These council members were briefed on the scope of their responsibilities and instructed to consider the following factors when evaluating candidates:\n\n1. **Past Contributions:** Assess candidates based on their previous work.\n2. **Verification:** Confirm the validity of claimed contributions.\n3. **Application Quality:** Evaluate the clarity and thoroughness of the applications.\n4. **Reward Criteria:** Candidates were judged on contributions to the following categories:\n    - **Awareness:** Efforts to raise brand awareness, such as social media activity or public mentions.\n    - **Operations:** Initiatives that improve the coordination of Greenpill Nigeria and ecosystem partners.\n    - **Environmental Initiatives:** Work in areas like tree planting, waste management, solar distribution, or environmental data analysis.\n    - **Education:** Efforts to educate others about Greenpill Nigeria or the broader ReFi movement.\n    - **Community Building:** Activities that bring people together to work on regenerative goals.\n\n### Pre-Round Awareness\n\nTo encourage participation, we implemented several outreach strategies:\n\n- Co-hosted an [XSpace](https://x.com/GreenpillNaija/status/1839353950195355761) on public goods retro funding with the Pro Nouns community.\n- Sent direct invitations to known contributors.\n- Held daily Telegram workshops for potential applicants.\n- Used social media to promote the round and invite participants.\n\n### Voting Process\n\nAfter applications were submitted, council members were given 1,000 points to allocate among six approved candidates, based on the established criteria. Here's how each council member approached their decision:\n\n- **CJ:** Focused on alignment with Greenpill Nigeria's mission of sustainability and regeneration. He prioritized projects with demonstrated impact, innovation, and community engagement.\n- **Princewill:** Emphasized visibility and sustainability, considering the broader needs of the sector.\n- **Mmerichuckwu:** Based his decisions on candidates' track records, supplementing the incomplete applications with independent online research.\n\nTo hear more of this process feel free to listen to the retrospective [X space](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1MnGnDrrAEoxO). \n\n### Results\n\nThe 1,000 points was distributed as follows (based on average votes):\n\n- **Mercy (TAS project):** 260\n- **Ada (AfriLearn):** 220\n- **Emmanuel (PHweb3connect):** 183\n- **Whizrael Graphics:** 117\n- **Jude:** 110\n- **Sanitation BCFET:** 110\n\n\n## Challenges and Solutions\n\nSeveral issues arose during the round:\n\n1. **Platform Accessibility:** The Easyretro PGF platform had connectivity issues in Nigeria.\n2. **Application Clarity:** Some candidates misunderstood the application format, submitting projects instead of properly identifying themselves.\n3. **Short Timeline:** Both the awareness campaign and application period were too brief.\n\n### Proposed Solutions\n\n- Ensure all participants have access to a the necessary software.\n- Provide clearer guidance during workshops and improve the instructions on the application page.\n- Establish a dedicated feedback channel for applicants.\n- Start promotion 1-2 months before the next round to give applicants more preparation time.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nFor Q1, our focus will include:\n\n- Assigning council members for the Gardens project.\n- Revisiting the reward criteria to align with 2025 milestones:\n    - Education\n    - Regional Awareness\n    - Environmental Initiatives\n    - Operations\n    - Community Building\n- Funding Gardens based on the Q1-Q2 budget.\n- Initiating conviction voting for priority sectors.",

Bringing together GreenPill Network 1, ReFi DAO 1, Celo Regional DAOs 1 and Regens Unite 1, we aim to support a global movement of regenerative communities leveraging Web3 for real-world impact and addressing local needs. The round will feed into a program to support the further development of local community impact tracking methodologies, grant tooling interoperability, and integrated QF & RPGF. We have currently secured $60K in funding from Celo Public Goods, ReFi DAO and Greenpill and ask for Gitcoin’s backing as we embark on a shared mission to showcase how community coordination, Web3, and innovative financial mechanisms can enable ecological and social regeneration on a global scale.",

Bringing together GreenPill Network 1, ReFi DAO 1, Celo Regional DAOs 1 and Regens Unite 1, we aim to support a global movement of regenerative communities leveraging Web3 for real-world impact and addressing local needs. The round will feed into a program to support the further development of local community impact tracking methodologies, grant tooling interoperability, and integrated QF & RPGF. We have currently secured $60K in funding from Celo Public Goods, ReFi DAO and Greenpill and ask for Gitcoin’s backing as we embark on a shared mission to showcase how community coordination, Web3, and innovative financial mechanisms can enable ecological and social regeneration on a global scale.",
