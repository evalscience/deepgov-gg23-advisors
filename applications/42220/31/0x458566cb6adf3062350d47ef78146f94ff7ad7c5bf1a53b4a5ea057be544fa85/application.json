Defend them from floods, droughts, wildfires and other climate events. \n\nOn the other side is Regeneration. While we build resilience to mitigate climate change and adapt to it, we also need to actively accelerate removal and reduction of GHG by making regenerative life support systems more accessible.\n\n[![Vision-Mission.png](https://i.postimg.cc/TwvFc7BC/Vision-Mission.png)](https://postimg.cc/Y48dr3rW)\n\n# Vision\n\nWe dream of a future where humans finally decouple progress from the current degenerative systems to more regenerative systems.
