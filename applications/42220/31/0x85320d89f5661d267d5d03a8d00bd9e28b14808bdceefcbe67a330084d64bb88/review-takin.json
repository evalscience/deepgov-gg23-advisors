  "review": "Bloom Network presents a compelling vision for harmonizing technological advancement with community well-being and environmental sustainability, aligning profoundly with the Gross National Happiness principles. The project's foundation as a 'place-based social network with a peer incubator for community initiatives' directly supports the constitutional emphasis on community engagement and local ownership (Principles 5, 7). Its impressive track record, engaging over 30,000 people across 32 hubs in 13 countries, and facilitating thousands of urban farms, community enterprises, and watershed restoration projects, demonstrates a tangible commitment to real-world impact and sustainable development (Principle 39).\n\nThe innovative integration of Web3 bounties to 'scale impact and fund grassroots solutions' is a significant strength. By onboarding first-time users to Web3 and incentivizing 'image-rich impact reporting' that automatically posts to Karma GAP, Bloom Network enhances transparency and accountability in funding processes (Principle 13). This mechanism also ensures that 'invisible labor' critical to community-building and economic transformation is seen and compensated, directly contributing to equitable access and collective well-being (Principle 6, 40). The project's commitment to growing local treasuries and financing grassroots development further reinforces local economic resilience and self-sufficiency (Principle 4, 20).\n\nThe 2025 milestones, including expanding outreach to 100 local Blooms and 1,000 members, integrating impact report reviews into their app, and upgrading Karma GAP integration to the Common Impact Data Standard, indicate a clear roadmap for continued growth and improved efficiency. The team's dual expertise as 'local community organizers and technologists' ensures that the tools developed are 'actually needed' and effectively used by real-world leaders, fostering local technological capabilities (Principle 32).\n\nWhile the application does not explicitly detail how it integrates with specific cultural heritage elements like Dzongkha, its fundamental 'place-based' and 'community-oriented' approach inherently supports the preservation of local identity and practices by empowering communities to define and pursue their own regenerative actions. The project's success measurement, focusing on 'real-world impact' and compensating labor, moves beyond purely quantitative metrics, aligning with the holistic well-being indicators of GNH (Principle 35). The overall contribution to 'regenerating the planet' while 'bringing the next billion people on-chain' is a powerful testament to its alignment with a future vision of harmonious technological development. üå±üåç",

  "reasoning": "Bloom Network demonstrates exceptional alignment with the constitutional principles, particularly in its commitment to holistic balance, community participation, and sustainable development. The project harmonizes technological innovation (Web3 bounties, app integration) with real-world, grassroots action, reflecting Principle 2 (integrating modern solutions with traditional wisdom). Its focus on empowering local leaders, fostering community ownership, and compensating 'invisible labor' strongly aligns with Principles 5, 7, and 8, which prioritize community engagement, local capacity building, and decentralized approaches. Furthermore, the explicit goals of restoring ecosystems, regenerating economies, and supporting agroforestry and soil regeneration directly embody Principles 17, 18, and 19, emphasizing environmental sustainability and conservation. The project's overall contribution to collective well-being and community flourishing, rather than individual advancement, resonates deeply with Principle 40, making it a strong investment for harmonious progress. üèîÔ∏èüå±",
