  "summary": "The Rekt Security Intelligence Terminal is an AI-powered tool designed to enhance the security of Web3 projects by providing developers with real-time access to historical exploit data. It aims to transform static journalism into interactive intelligence, allowing developers to scan smart contract code for known vulnerabilities and learn from past incidents. The project is under development and plans to integrate advanced AI and cryptography-based security tooling. The grant will be used to build the MVP, train AI models, and deploy on-chain content.",
  "review": "The Rekt Security Intelligence Terminal presents a compelling proposal to address a significant gap in the Web3 development ecosystem: the lack of accessible, real-time security intelligence for developers. By leveraging the extensive archive of Rekt News, the project aims to provide developers with tools to detect vulnerabilities and learn from past security incidents. The integration of AI and cryptography-based tools, such as FHE and MPC, further enhances the project's potential impact on Web3 security.\n\nStrengths of the application include its innovative approach to transforming journalism into a security tool, the strong reputation and existing community support of Rekt News, and the strategic partnerships with leading security firms. However, the project is still in its early stages, with the MVP expected in Q2 2025, which poses a risk regarding timely delivery and execution.\n\nThe roadmap is ambitious, with clear milestones and a detailed plan for fund usage. However, the application could benefit from more specific metrics or examples of how the tool will reduce development barriers and improve efficiency. Additionally, while the project has a strong foundation in journalism, its transition to a technical tool requires careful execution to ensure it meets the needs of developers effectively.",
