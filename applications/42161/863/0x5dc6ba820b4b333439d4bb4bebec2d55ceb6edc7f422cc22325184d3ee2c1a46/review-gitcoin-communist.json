  "summary": "The Rekt Security Intelligence Terminal is an AI-powered tool designed to enhance the security of Web3 projects by providing developers with real-time access to historical exploit data. The project aims to transform static journalism into interactive intelligence, allowing developers to scan smart contract code against known exploit patterns and learn from past incidents. The tool is currently under development, with a roadmap extending to Q4 2025, and plans to integrate advanced AI and cryptography-based security tooling. The project has a strong community backing and a reputation for in-depth exploit post-mortems.",
  "review": "The Rekt Security Intelligence Terminal presents a compelling proposal to address a significant gap in the Web3 development ecosystem: the lack of accessible, real-time security intelligence for developers. By leveraging the extensive archive of Rekt News, the project aims to provide developers with tools to detect vulnerabilities and learn from past security incidents. The integration of AI and formal verification tools, along with partnerships with leading security firms, adds credibility to the project's potential impact. However, the project is still in its early stages, with a roadmap extending to 2025, which raises concerns about the timeline for delivering tangible results. Additionally, while the project has a strong community presence, more concrete evidence of current tool usage and support within the developer community would strengthen the application.",
