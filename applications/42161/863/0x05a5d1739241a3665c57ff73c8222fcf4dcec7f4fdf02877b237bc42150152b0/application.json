Tools like EIP-712 and ERC-191 that standardize the handling and signing of structured data, bit manipulation and transaction decoders to help in debugging. Developers can leverage the zk-boilerplate for building privacy-focused dapps. There are many such utilities that further support the developers by offering versatile, user-friendly tools for a variety of smart contract development tasks. Collectively, these tools enable developers to build, test, and debug web3 apps with greater ease and efficiency.",

Allow easy filtering of of features and smart contract functions\nABI Encoder - Easy to use abi encoder for the solidity smart contracts  \nEVMTools Extension - All the evmtools are accessible directly from the extension, just a click away. Developers need not break their development flow instead they can access all the tools directly from the extension\nThere are 21+ tools available.",
