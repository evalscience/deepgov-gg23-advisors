  "summary": "The Variance project is an open-source toolkit designed to integrate Flutter-based mobile development with the Web3 ecosystem. It aims to simplify the creation of decentralized applications by providing a modular API for secure and efficient blockchain interactions. The project has demonstrated real-world application through integrations with platforms like Voltage and Learnway, and it has a roadmap for future development that includes support for various Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs).",
  "review": "The Variance project presents a compelling case for funding within the GG23 OSS - Developer Tooling and Libraries round. It addresses key inefficiencies in the development of mobile-native Web3 applications by providing a modular, open-source toolkit that simplifies complex blockchain interactions. The project is well-aligned with the round's focus on reducing development barriers and improving efficiency, as evidenced by its integration with real-world applications like Voltage and Learnway. \n\nStrengths of the application include its clear demonstration of community support, with over 5,000 downloads and active GitHub engagement, and its commitment to open-source principles. The project also outlines a detailed roadmap for future development, which includes the implementation of new EIPs to enhance functionality and security.\n\nHowever, the application could benefit from more detailed information on its sustainability model and how it plans to maintain operations without continuous grant funding. Additionally, while the project has demonstrated initial success, more quantifiable metrics on its impact and adoption would strengthen its case. \n\nOverall, the Variance project is a strong candidate for funding, with a clear focus on enhancing the developer experience in the Web3 ecosystem.",
