  "summary": "Etherplay Open Source Game Studio is a project focused on building open-source games and tools using Ethereum technology. The project has been active since 2016 and has developed several tools and games that emphasize decentralization and permissionless operation. The application highlights tools like hardhat-deploy, clones-with-immutable, and ethereum-indexer, which are designed to enhance the development process by reducing barriers, improving efficiency, and enhancing security. The project has a strong community presence, with significant usage metrics and contributions to the open-source ecosystem.",
  "review": "The Etherplay Open Source Game Studio application presents a compelling case for funding within the GG23 OSS round. The project aligns well with the round's focus on developer tooling and libraries, demonstrating significant contributions to the Web3 ecosystem. The tools developed by Etherplay, such as hardhat-deploy and ethereum-indexer, are widely used and respected within the community, indicating strong support and relevance. The project's commitment to open-source principles and its track record of innovation since 2016 further strengthen its application. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the specific impact metrics and future plans for the tools and games being developed.",
