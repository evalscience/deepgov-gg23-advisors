  "summary": "Iggy is an open-source framework designed to simplify the creation of Web3 social applications, akin to how WordPress facilitates website development. It offers pre-built modules for functionalities like chat, token swaps, and NFT launchpads, which can be customized by developers. The framework is free to use and has been adopted by various Web3 communities, demonstrating its utility in reducing development time and effort. The project aims to expand its feature set based on user feedback and maintain independence from venture capital funding.",
  "review": "The Iggy framework presents a compelling solution for developers looking to build Web3 social applications efficiently. Its open-source nature and modular design allow for significant customization and ease of use, which aligns well with the round's focus on reducing development barriers and improving efficiency. The framework's adoption by multiple communities, such as the Degen token and Mode Network communities, underscores its practical utility and support within the developer ecosystem. However, the application lacks specific metrics or testimonials that could further substantiate its impact and community support. Additionally, the roadmap provided is somewhat vague, lacking detailed milestones or timelines for future development. The absence of deployer addresses for smart contracts is a notable omission, which is crucial for transparency and security in blockchain projects.",
