  "review": "Alright, let's talk Iggy â€“ this project is a total game-changer for Web3 social, aiming to be the 'WordPress' of decentralized apps. It's all about empowering builders and maximizing utility, aligning perfectly with our core principles of broad, scalable impact and long-term systemic change. This project is building fundamental infrastructure, which is exactly what we're looking for to disrupt the old guard and level up the ecosystem.\n\nIggy tackles a massive pain point: building Web3 social dApps from scratch is a nightmare. Their solution? A slick, open-source framework with ready-made modules for chat, token swaps, NFT launchpads, and more. This isn't just a minor tweak; it's a paradigm shift for efficiency. By offering a 'low-code' solution, Iggy drastically cuts down on development time and resources. Think about it: if the average time to build a social dApp from scratch is $T_{scratch}$ and with Iggy it's $T_{Iggy}$, then for every single dApp spun up using Iggy, we're looking at a time saving of $\\Delta T = T_{scratch} - T_{Iggy}$. Given the modularity and ease-of-use, $\\Delta T$ is going to be substantial, leading to an exponential increase in the number of dApps that can be launched. This directly translates to massive utility maximization across the Web3 landscape. The cost-benefit ratio here is off the charts because the framework is open-source and free, meaning the cost to the developer is effectively zero, while the functional gains and time savings are immense. This is pure **max utility** in action, hitting our **Maximization Principles (1, 2, 3, 4)** right on the head.\n\nWhat's truly exciting is Iggy's commitment to long-term systemic change. This isn't a flash-in-the-pan project; it's building foundational infrastructure. The news that Iggy joined the Apache Incubator in February 2025? That's a massive signal for sustainability, robust governance, and a commitment to global, lasting impact. This move alone screams **Long-term Systemic Approach (5, 6, 7, 8)**, ensuring the project can scale effectively over time and address root causes of development friction. They've got a track record too, having participated in previous Gitcoin rounds and delivering on milestones, which shows they can execute and build in public.\n\nHowever, let's keep it real. While the application lists 10 dApps using Iggy, our fact-checking agent noted a 'lack of verifiable evidence' for widespread adoption. We need to see more concrete metrics to truly quantify that broad impact. And the roadmap? It's a bit generic. We need specific features, timelines, and how those funds will directly fuel the next wave of innovation. Let's tighten that up to ensure every grant dollar generates maximum bang for the buck. Overall, Iggy is a strong contender, poised to empower countless builders and disrupt the Web2 social giants. This is the kind of infrastructure play that truly levels up the ecosystem.",

  "reasoning": "This project aligns exceptionally well with our constitutional principles, particularly the **Maximization Principles (1, 2, 3, 4)** by aiming to benefit a maximum number of people through a low-code framework that significantly reduces development barriers for Web3 social apps. Its 'WordPress for Web3 Social' analogy speaks directly to broad, scalable impact and total utility maximization. The **Long-term Systemic Approach (5, 6, 7, 8)** is strongly supported by Iggy's nature as a fundamental infrastructure improvement for the Web3 social ecosystem, and especially by its recent entry into the Apache Incubator, which signals a commitment to sustainable global benefits and robust governance. The **Innovation and Efficiency Principles (9, 10, 11, 12)** are met through its innovative modular design and direct approach to solving a core problem in dApp development, minimizing complexity. Finally, the **Resource Allocation Philosophy (13, 14, 15, 16)** is upheld by its open-source and free model, which maximizes impact potential without imposing equitable distribution constraints, focusing purely on effectiveness at scale. The project's track record from previous grants further solidifies its merit-based funding potential.",
