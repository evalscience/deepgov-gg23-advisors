          "answer": "EAS Pulse is a free multichain attestation analytics platform that provides insights into the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS). It helps developers, data analysts, and organizations better understand the usage, performance, and trends of attestations across various blockchains. By offering clear visualizations and actionable data, EAS Pulse empowers users to optimize attestation usage, improve decision-making, and foster ecosystem growth.\n\nThe platform addresses several inefficiencies in the development process:\n\nTransparent Data: Developers and businesses often lack of additional sources and easy access to on-chain attestation data, hindering informed decision-making. EAS Pulse provides clear, actionable insights into attestation metrics, trends, and performance.\n\nComplexity of Multiple Chains: With support for multiple blockchains the platform consolidates attestation data across chains, simplifying the process for developers working in diverse ecosystems.\n\nInaccessible Performance Metrics: Many developers struggle to track and analyze performance metrics related to attestations. EAS Pulse offers advanced metrics, such as attestation revenue, unique recipients, and attestation trends, making it easier for users to assess the performance of their projects.\n\nBarriers to Contribution: By being open-source, EAS Pulse encourages contributions from the community, improving accessibility and collaboration within the broader EAS ecosystem.\n\nThis helps reduce the friction in building, tracking, and optimizing applications that rely on attestations.",

          "answer": "EAS Pulse plays a key role in reducing development barriers, improving efficiency, and enhancing the security of Web3 projects in several ways:\nReducing Development Barriers:\nData Accessibility: Many developers face challenges in accessing reliable and transparent data on attestation usage and performance. EAS Pulse eliminates this barrier by providing a free, easy-to-use platform with curated metrics and insights. Developers no longer need to manually collect and aggregate data, saving time and effort.\nOpen-Source Platform: EAS Pulse is open-source, encouraging collaboration and allowing developers to fork, customize, and contribute to the platform. This open access helps streamline the development process, enabling a broader community to build and innovate without starting from scratch.\nMultichain Support: EAS Pulse aggregates data from various blockchains (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, etc.), addressing the challenge of working across multiple ecosystems. Developers can focus on their projects without worrying about fragmented data sources, which reduces the complexity of managing Web3 projects across chains.\nImproving Efficiency:\nAutomated Data Collection: EAS Pulse uses scheduled queries (e.g., weekly updates) to provide developers with real-time attestation data. This automation improves efficiency by eliminating the need for manual data fetching and processing. Developers can rely on consistent, up-to-date data, allowing them to make quicker decisions.\nActionable Insights: By providing clear visualizations of key metrics (such as attestation revenue, top attestors, and attestation trends), the platform streamlines decision-making for developers. This reduces time spent on analyzing raw data and accelerates the development process.\nFaster Execution: The platform is designed for fast data retrieval and intuitive user experience, making it easier for developers to quickly access and interpret data.\nEnhancing Security:\nTransparency: By offering a comprehensive view of attestation data and performance across multiple chains, EAS Pulse enhances transparency in the ecosystem. This visibility allows developers to identify suspicious activities or anomalies in attestation trends, improving the security of their projects.\nTrustworthy Data: As the platform aggregates data from Dune Analytics it helps ensure that the attestation data developers rely on is accurate and secure, reducing the risk of faulty or misleading information being used in projects.\nEcosystem Monitoring: The platform's insights into attestation usage, revocations, and revenue help developers monitor their projects' security in real-time. For example, if abnormal spikes in attestation revocations or unusual patterns in recipients are detected, developers can take proactive measures to ensure the integrity of their applications.",

        "description": "EAS Pulse is a free multichain attestation analytics platform (web app and Dune dashboard) for all about on-chain Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), providing insights on attestation usage, performance, and trends.\nIt all started as a hack for [ETHGlobal Superhack 2024](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/eas-pulse-yhn4i).\n\nEAS is an infrastructure public good for making attestations on-chain or off-chain about anything.\n\nEAS Pulse is intuitive on helping developers and organizations gain insights about attestation usage, performance, revenue generation, trends, and opportunities on-chain.\n\n# Mission\n\nEAS Pulse was created to help developers, data analysts and other stakeholders better understand the usage and adoption of the Ethereum Attestation Service. By providing in-depth analytics, trends, and performance metrics, EAS Pulse aims to:\n\n- Empower developers: Offering actionable insights that help them optimize the design and performance of their projects based on on-chain attestation data.\n\n- Enable data-driven decision-making: Providing clear visualizations of trends and metrics so developers and businesses can make informed decisions about their use of attestations.\n\n- Foster transparency: Giving users access to critical data that helps demystify the attestation ecosystem, supporting broader adoption of EAS across multiple chains.\n\n- Improve the ecosystem: By providing a comprehensive view of the ecosystem, EAS Pulse helps identify opportunities for growth, collaboration, and innovation.\n\n![](https://ivanmolto.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeifzw6he7ue7avgi3qtnbzqq4vyaedvsolrkyee6o4pswymzhavvhu)\n\n# Features, Metrics and Insights\n\nCurrently, we provide a curated and easy-to-understand set of metrics focusing on:\n\n- Blockchain networks: Arbitrum One, Base, Celo, Ethereum, Linea, Arbitrum Nova, Optimism, Polygon, Scroll, zkSync Era.\n- Flagship attestors: Coinbase Verifications, Human Passport, and Optimism Collective.\n- Featured attestors: Gitcoin and more.\n\nThese are some of the metrics and insights:\n\n- Total attestations\n- Total revocations\n- Unique recipients\n- Unique attestors\n- Attestations over time\n- Attestations by chain\n- Daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly attestations\n- Top attestors\n- Attestation revenue\n- Flagship attestors\n- Other featured attestors\n\n# A Message from the Creator\n\nHi there! I am Ivan Molto and I am leading EAS Pulse. As an engineer, analyst, hacker, meme creator, coder and public goods maxi, I have made a lot of projects and wacky things. Some of those I share with you [here](https://www.ivanmolto.com) and [here](https://x.com/ivanmolto)\n\n# Roadmap\n\n## Integration of additional chains\n\nAs EAS Pulse grows, we aim to include more blockchains that support Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), such as Shape network, offering insights across a broader ecosystem. This will increase the utility and relevance of the platform for developers and analysts working across different chains.\n\n## Advanced metrics\n\nWe will enhance the data collection and analysis features to include additional metrics such as more granular attestation data, further segmentation by attestor types, and detailed breakdowns of revenue sources.\n\n## Better user experience (UX)\n\nWe will improve the platform UX/UI design, making the dashboard more intuitive and user-friendly for users with varying technical expertise. And boosting experience with fast executions.\n\n## Open-source development\n\nWe remain committed to keeping EAS Pulse open-source, and part of our efforts will be directed towards maintaining the GitHub repository, Dune paid plan, improving documentation, and providing educational resources to empower the community to fork, customize, and contribute to the platform.\n\n# Tech Stack\n\nInitially the project was developed using Dune Analytics and (Dune)SQL which is a fork of Trino.\nAs a resource you can fork the queries directly from Dune Analytics [here](https://dune.com/ivanmolto/eas-pulse-ethereum-attestation-service) or by forking the [repository](https://github.com/ivanmolto/easpulse)\nSince GG22, we have been working on transitioning to a full-stack platform using Dune APIs.\nCreating and managing API endpoints from Dune queries on the web app (NextJS), enabling data consumption via custom URLs with scheduled query execution (Mondays early morning).\n\n# Call to Action\n\nWe invite you to explore EAS Pulse and start surfacing valuable insights into the Ethereum Attestation Service. Whether you are a developer, analyst, or part of an organization, our platform provides accessible, free-to-use data to help you better understand attestation usage, trends, and opportunities.\n\nStart exploring EAS Pulse: [Visit the platform](https://www.easpulse.com)\n\nFork the queries used in the platform for your own analysis or as an educational resource: [Dune Analytics Dashboard](https://dune.com/ivanmolto/eas-pulse-ethereum-attestation-service)\n\nContribute to the open-source project: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/easpulse)\n\nFollow updates and engage with the community: Follow us on X (Twitter) [here](https://x.com/eas_pulse)\n\nBy supporting this project, you help advance transparency and data-driven insights within the EAS ecosystem. Your participation, feedback, and contributions are key to our mission of empowering developers and data analysts with meaningful, open data.",

      "description": "EAS Pulse is a free multichain attestation analytics platform (web app and Dune dashboard) for all about on-chain Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), providing insights on attestation usage, performance, and trends.\nIt all started as a hack for [ETHGlobal Superhack 2024](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/eas-pulse-yhn4i).\n\nEAS is an infrastructure public good for making attestations on-chain or off-chain about anything.\n\nEAS Pulse is intuitive on helping developers and organizations gain insights about attestation usage, performance, revenue generation, trends, and opportunities on-chain.\n\n# Mission\n\nEAS Pulse was created to help developers, data analysts and other stakeholders better understand the usage and adoption of the Ethereum Attestation Service. By providing in-depth analytics, trends, and performance metrics, EAS Pulse aims to:\n\n- Empower developers: Offering actionable insights that help them optimize the design and performance of their projects based on on-chain attestation data.\n\n- Enable data-driven decision-making: Providing clear visualizations of trends and metrics so developers and businesses can make informed decisions about their use of attestations.\n\n- Foster transparency: Giving users access to critical data that helps demystify the attestation ecosystem, supporting broader adoption of EAS across multiple chains.\n\n- Improve the ecosystem: By providing a comprehensive view of the ecosystem, EAS Pulse helps identify opportunities for growth, collaboration, and innovation.\n\n![](https://ivanmolto.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeifzw6he7ue7avgi3qtnbzqq4vyaedvsolrkyee6o4pswymzhavvhu)\n\n# Features, Metrics and Insights\n\nCurrently, we provide a curated and easy-to-understand set of metrics focusing on:\n\n- Blockchain networks: Arbitrum One, Base, Celo, Ethereum, Linea, Arbitrum Nova, Optimism, Polygon, Scroll, zkSync Era.\n- Flagship attestors: Coinbase Verifications, Human Passport, and Optimism Collective.\n- Featured attestors: Gitcoin and more.\n\nThese are some of the metrics and insights:\n\n- Total attestations\n- Total revocations\n- Unique recipients\n- Unique attestors\n- Attestations over time\n- Attestations by chain\n- Daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly attestations\n- Top attestors\n- Attestation revenue\n- Flagship attestors\n- Other featured attestors\n\n# A Message from the Creator\n\nHi there! I am Ivan Molto and I am leading EAS Pulse. As an engineer, analyst, hacker, meme creator, coder and public goods maxi, I have made a lot of projects and wacky things. Some of those I share with you [here](https://www.ivanmolto.com) and [here](https://x.com/ivanmolto)\n\n# Roadmap\n\n## Integration of additional chains\n\nAs EAS Pulse grows, we aim to include more blockchains that support Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), such as Shape network, offering insights across a broader ecosystem. This will increase the utility and relevance of the platform for developers and analysts working across different chains.\n\n## Advanced metrics\n\nWe will enhance the data collection and analysis features to include additional metrics such as more granular attestation data, further segmentation by attestor types, and detailed breakdowns of revenue sources.\n\n## Better user experience (UX)\n\nWe will improve the platform UX/UI design, making the dashboard more intuitive and user-friendly for users with varying technical expertise. And boosting experience with fast executions.\n\n## Open-source development\n\nWe remain committed to keeping EAS Pulse open-source, and part of our efforts will be directed towards maintaining the GitHub repository, Dune paid plan, improving documentation, and providing educational resources to empower the community to fork, customize, and contribute to the platform.\n\n# Tech Stack\n\nInitially the project was developed using Dune Analytics and (Dune)SQL which is a fork of Trino.\nAs a resource you can fork the queries directly from Dune Analytics [here](https://dune.com/ivanmolto/eas-pulse-ethereum-attestation-service) or by forking the [repository](https://github.com/ivanmolto/easpulse)\nSince GG22, we have been working on transitioning to a full-stack platform using Dune APIs.\nCreating and managing API endpoints from Dune queries on the web app (NextJS), enabling data consumption via custom URLs with scheduled query execution (Mondays early morning).\n\n# Call to Action\n\nWe invite you to explore EAS Pulse and start surfacing valuable insights into the Ethereum Attestation Service. Whether you are a developer, analyst, or part of an organization, our platform provides accessible, free-to-use data to help you better understand attestation usage, trends, and opportunities.\n\nStart exploring EAS Pulse: [Visit the platform](https://www.easpulse.com)\n\nFork the queries used in the platform for your own analysis or as an educational resource: [Dune Analytics Dashboard](https://dune.com/ivanmolto/eas-pulse-ethereum-attestation-service)\n\nContribute to the open-source project: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/easpulse)\n\nFollow updates and engage with the community: Follow us on X (Twitter) [here](https://x.com/eas_pulse)\n\nBy supporting this project, you help advance transparency and data-driven insights within the EAS ecosystem. Your participation, feedback, and contributions are key to our mission of empowering developers and data analysts with meaningful, open data.",
