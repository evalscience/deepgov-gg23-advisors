With over 700 GitHub stars, it shows significant community support. The roadmap includes keeping the starter kit updated and expanding its capabilities with new technologies like ZK and TEE.",
  "review": "The Nexth project presents a strong case for funding within the GG23 OSS - Developer Tooling and Libraries round. It aligns well with the round's focus on empowering developers through efficient tools and libraries. The project addresses key inefficiencies in the Web3 development process by providing a ready-to-use starter kit that minimizes setup time and dependency management issues. This is particularly valuable in the fast-evolving Web3 space where keeping up with the latest tools and standards is crucial.\\n\\nThe project demonstrates significant community support, evidenced by its 700+ GitHub stars, indicating a positive reception and usage within the developer community. This aligns with the round's requirement for community support and usage.\\n\\nHowever, the application could benefit from more detailed information on how the grant funds will be specifically utilized to achieve the outlined roadmap goals. Additionally, while the project mentions plans to integrate new technologies, it lacks specific timelines or milestones for these developments.\\n\\nOverall, the Nexth project is a promising candidate for funding, offering a valuable tool for the Web3 developer community. It meets the eligibility criteria by demonstrating open-source principles and addressing development barriers effectively.",
