  "summary": "Chews Protocol is a modular Token Curated Registry (TCR) voting protocol designed to offer flexible and use-case-driven governance through its modular architecture. It allows for the creation of custom voting systems by composing different module types, making it suitable for a wide range of decision-making and governance applications. The protocol is currently in an experimental stage and is already being used by several projects, including Grant Ships, Gitcoin, and ask.haus. The project aims to improve user documentation and ease of use, with plans for further development and standardization in future versions.",
  "review": "The Chews Protocol application presents a promising project that aligns well with the round's focus on developer tooling and libraries. The protocol's modular architecture allows for flexible and customizable voting systems, addressing inefficiencies in traditional monolithic TCR systems. The application demonstrates current usage and support within the developer community, with implementations in projects like Grant Ships and Gitcoin, which enhances its credibility and relevance. However, the project is still in an experimental stage, which poses risks related to stability and long-term sustainability. The roadmap outlines plans for improving documentation and standardization, which are crucial for broader adoption and usability. The application could benefit from more detailed metrics or evidence of its impact on reducing development barriers and improving efficiency in Web3 projects. Overall, the project shows potential but requires further development and evidence of its effectiveness.",
