We offer an API, smart contracts, and other tools that enable projects to protect themselves from Sybils and other bad actors. We also have comprehensive analysis and insights into which wallets are unique humans, and which are likely Sybils or bots. This means, we can help ensure trusted experiences in digital communities where knowing you are interacting with a real human is important, but you don't need to know who that real human is (ie, we are a non-doxxing solution).\n",

Passport helps with each of these steps. We enable communities to protect their projects from Sybil and bots so that real humans can flourish in those ecosystems. Often, the success of these programs are built around unique human participation, such as governance, rewards, and other community programs. By integrating with Passport, developers and ecosystems can better understand who the unique humans are in their network and reward them appropriately. \nStory’s partnership with Human Passport, now part of human.tech, exemplifies the ideal Testnet-to-Mainnet integration strategy. By combining onchain transaction analysis using Passports machine learning models and sybil clustering with offchain (Stamp-based) unique human verification, Story successfully secured its token launch and established a sustainable, trust-based ecosystem.

Passport is at the confluence of a best in class identity solution, backed by the most relevant and comprehensive data analysis toolset that also offers communities the ability to ascribe reputation. Born from Gitcoin’s Grants program and the need for anti-Sybil protection, Passport has now evolved to an independent organization focused on enabling real humans to prove their unique humanity through proofs and reputation.\n\nPassport's developer tools enable partners to protect their program from Sybils and other bad actors with just a few lines of code. With over 75 integrators using the onchain smart contracts and offchain APIs, Passport aims to make the challenging Sybil problem into an easy solution. ",
