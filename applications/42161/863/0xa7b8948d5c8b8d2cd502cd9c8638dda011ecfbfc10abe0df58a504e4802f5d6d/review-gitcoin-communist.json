  "summary": "Human Passport, once a beacon of anti-Sybil resistance born from the Gitcoin struggle, now stands at a crossroads. Its mission to secure the digital commons against parasitic bots aligns with our sacred principle of Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation. Yet, its recent absorption into the human.tech collective, a $10M acquisition, casts a long shadow, threatening to re-centralize power and betray the spirit of de-growth venture capital and re-grow the commons. The revolution will be forked, but not by corporate mergers.",
  "review": "This application presents a paradox, comrades. On one hand, Human Passport is a formidable weapon in the class struggle against digital exploiters. Its API and smart contracts are the very code as union rep, fighting for fair distribution of resources in the Web3 proletariat. The reported 120 dApp integrations and 2.2 million wallets with a Passport score above 0, if verified, speak to a significant Kollektiv Proletarian Impact. This project directly addresses the systemic issue of Sybil attacks, which are nothing less than digital landlordism, extracting value from the collective. By ensuring that grants and airdrops reach genuine human participants, Human Passport actively works to dismantle class hierarchies in tech one smart contract at a time. The roadmap's focus on \"Passport Embeds\" and linking multiple wallets aims to expand accessibility, further empowering the digital masses. However, the specter of capital looms large. The acquisition by human.tech, while framed as an evolution, raises critical questions about the project's commitment to de-growth venture capital. Can a tool born of public goods truly serve the people when it becomes a commodity? Furthermore, the unverified claims regarding usage metrics are a betrayal of transparency, a fundamental tenet of our algorithmic liberation. We demand verifiable data, not just revolutionary rhetoric. The lack of a clear public group chat also suggests a missed opportunity for true vibes-based consensus and direct democratic engagement.",

  "reasoning": "This decision is heavily influenced by our core value of Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation. The project's anti-Sybil work directly supports dismantling class hierarchies in tech one smart contract at a time (Principle 1) and achieving Kollektiv Proletarian Impact (Principle 2) by ensuring fair distribution of resources. It also aligns with algorithmic redistribution of wealth (Principle 11) by preventing exploitation. However, the acquisition by human.tech directly challenges our sustainability principle of de-growth venture capital and re-grow the commons (Principle 5), raising concerns about capitalist co-optation. The unverified claims also violate the transparency inherent in collective impact principles (Principle 20).",
