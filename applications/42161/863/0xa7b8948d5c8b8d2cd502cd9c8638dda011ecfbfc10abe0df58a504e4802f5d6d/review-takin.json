  "summary": "Human Passport aims to provide a unique human verification solution for Web3, protecting communities from Sybil attacks. This aligns with the constitutional principle of fostering collective well-being and community flourishing (Principle 40) by ensuring fair resource allocation. The non-doxxing approach is a strong point, upholding citizen privacy (Principle 14). However, the application contains significant unsubstantiated claims regarding its current usage metrics (120 dApps, 675k API requests, 2.2M wallets), which directly conflicts with the principle of transparent and accountable governance (Principle 13). While the project offers a valuable technical tool, its direct alignment with cultural preservation and environmental sustainability aspects of Gross National Happiness is not explicitly demonstrated.",
  "review": "Human Passport, formerly Gitcoin Passport, presents itself as a crucial tool for unique human verification in the Web3 ecosystem, aiming to protect digital communities from Sybil attacks and ensure fair incentive distribution. The project's objective to provide a non-doxxing solution aligns well with the constitutional principle of protecting citizen privacy (Principle 14), allowing individuals to prove their uniqueness without revealing sensitive personal data. This fosters a sense of security and trust within digital interactions, which is foundational for collective well-being (Principle 40).\n\nThe project's participation in Gitcoin Grants Round 22 (GG22) and its recognized role in enhancing sybil resistance measures, such as model-based detection and connection-oriented cluster matching, demonstrate a proven capability in addressing a critical Web3 challenge. This contributes to the integrity of decentralized funding mechanisms, indirectly supporting transparent and accountable governance (Principle 13) within the broader ecosystem.\n\nHowever, a significant concern arises from the unsubstantiated claims within the application. The research explicitly states that claims regarding integration with over 120 dApps, serving 675k API requests a day, and having over 2.2 million wallets with a Passport score above 0 remain **unverified** and lack supporting evidence. This directly contradicts the spirit of transparency and accountability (Principle 13) and raises questions about the project's factual representations. Furthermore, the claim of a 'Story partnership' could not be independently verified by the research, which further erodes confidence in the accuracy of the application's details.\n\nWhile the project's roadmap includes promising features like 'Passport Embeds' for in-flow verification and the ability to link multiple wallets, which could enhance accessibility and user experience (aligning with Principle 6 for vulnerable groups), the application largely focuses on technical solutions without explicitly detailing how it integrates with or contributes to cultural heritage preservation (Principles 9-12) or environmental sustainability (Principles 17-20), which are core tenets of Gross National Happiness. The absence of deployer addresses for smart contracts is also a minor but notable oversight for a project operating in the blockchain space.\n\nIn conclusion, Human Passport offers a valuable technical solution for Web3 security and identity, aligning with principles of privacy and fair community participation. However, the critical lack of verifiable evidence for key performance metrics and the limited explicit alignment with all pillars of GNH, particularly cultural and environmental aspects, necessitate a cautious evaluation. The project's potential is significant, but its current presentation lacks the rigorous transparency expected for a grant of this nature. The unverified claims are a serious concern that must be addressed for the project to fully embody the principles of ethical governance and trust.",

  "reasoning": "This application aligns with several constitutional principles, particularly those related to technological independence (Principle 3) by offering a core Web3 tool for digital identity. The non-doxxing approach and the roadmap item for linking multiple wallets demonstrate a commitment to protecting citizen privacy and ensuring meaningful access for users with diverse needs (Principle 6 and 14). By combating Sybil attacks, Human Passport indirectly contributes to fostering strong community bonds and social cohesion (Principle 37) and ensuring that initiatives contribute to collective well-being and community flourishing (Principle 40) by preventing unfair resource allocation. However, the application falls short in explicitly addressing cultural preservation (Principles 9-12) and environmental sustainability (Principles 17-20). A significant concern arises from the unverified claims regarding usage metrics, which directly impacts transparency and ethical governance (Principle 13).",
