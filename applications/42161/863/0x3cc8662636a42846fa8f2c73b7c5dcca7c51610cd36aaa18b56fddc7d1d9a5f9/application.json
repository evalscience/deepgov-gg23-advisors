It simplifies mobile dApp development with fast, secure and customizable pre-built components to create, deploy and interact with smart contracts.\n\n[Watch me mint a Snowman NFT!☃️](https://youtu.be/CaJTnRtLOK8)\n\n### Mission Statement\n\nETH Mobile will serve as the foundation of THE NEW WAVE of mobile dApps by creating the best experience for mobile users. We aim to inspire founders to scale, to provide job opportunities, and to grow the web3 community through smooth transitioning.\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nAs the decentralized ecosystem grows, the demand for high-quality mobile dApps increases. However, current tools for developing mobile dApps are fragmented and inefficient, especially on Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains. Developers face challenges managing smart contracts, building user-friendly interfaces, and ensuring wallet security—all on mobile platforms. This lack of streamlined solutions limits the speed and quality of mobile dApp development and adoption.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\n**ETH Mobile** offers a comprehensive mobile-first development environment tailored to Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains. By integrating essential development tools and features, it simplifies the mobile dApp development process.\n\n⚙️ **Tech Stack**: Built with React Native, Hardhat, Ethers, and TypeScript to streamline mobile dApp development.\n\n#### Key Features\n\n- 🧑‍💻 **Contract Debugger**: Inspect smart contract details such as address, balance, variables, and functions. It also allows real-time interaction with contracts, making development more efficient.\n\n![Contract Debugger](https://dewdrip.github.io/eth-mobile/assets/debugger.png)\n\n- 💳 **In-App Wallet**: A secure mobile crypto wallet for managing funds, signing transactions, and interacting with multiple EVM-compatible chains.\n\n![Wallet](https://dewdrip.github.io/eth-mobile/assets/wallet.png)\n\n- ✅ **Contract Hot Reload**: Automatically updates the mobile frontend to reflect changes made to smart contracts during development.\n- 🪝 **Custom Hooks**: A collection of React hooks with TypeScript autocompletion, simplifying contract interaction in your mobile app.\n- 🧱 **Web3 Components**: Pre-built components for quickly building mobile dApp frontends.\n\nBy providing these tools, ETH Mobile drastically reduces the time and effort required to build mobile dApps, making development more accessible to both new and experienced developers.\n\n### Project Roadmap\n\n**Phase 1: Core Development (Completed)**\n\n- Implemented in-built wallet, contract hot reload, contract debugger, and custom hooks.\n\n**Phase 2: Expansion (Next 3-6 months)**\n\n- Comprehensive project documentation for easy adoption.\n- Convert existing web dApps to mobile dApps by collaborating with founders.\n- Build additional components, hooks, and utilities for complex mobile dApp frontends.\n- Support zkApp development\n\n### Team\n\n**Valentine Orga**: Lead Developer and Blockchain Architect with extensive experience in Ethereum and EVM-compatible smart contract development. I am passionate about mobile dApp innovation and have a proven track record in building decentralized applications for both web and mobile platforms.\n\n### Why Support Us?\n\n**ETH Mobile** is crucial for the future of mobile dApp development on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains. By supporting ETH Mobile, you are contributing to the growth of mobile decentralized applications, helping developers deliver seamless and user-friendly dApps. ETH Mobile not only simplifies development but also enhances mobile accessibility, ensuring users can interact with dApps effortlessly.\n\nIf you believe in the future of mobile-first dApps on Ethereum and beyond, **DONATE TO SUPPORT ETH MOBILE**!\n\n### Links & Resources\n\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/dewdrip/eth-mobile)\n- [X](https://x.com/ValentineOrga)\n",

      "description": "⭐️ Mobile (zk/d)Apps...  **ETH Mobile** is an open-source toolkit for building decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains. It simplifies mobile dApp development with fast, secure and customizable pre-built components to create, deploy and interact with smart contracts.\n\n[Watch me mint a Snowman NFT!☃️](https://youtu.be/CaJTnRtLOK8)\n\n### Mission Statement\n\nETH Mobile will serve as the foundation of THE NEW WAVE of mobile dApps by creating the best experience for mobile users. We aim to inspire founders to scale, to provide job opportunities, and to grow the web3 community through smooth transitioning.\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nAs the decentralized ecosystem grows, the demand for high-quality mobile dApps increases. However, current tools for developing mobile dApps are fragmented and inefficient, especially on Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains. Developers face challenges managing smart contracts, building user-friendly interfaces, and ensuring wallet security—all on mobile platforms. This lack of streamlined solutions limits the speed and quality of mobile dApp development and adoption.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\n**ETH Mobile** offers a comprehensive mobile-first development environment tailored to Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains. By integrating essential development tools and features, it simplifies the mobile dApp development process.\n\n⚙️ **Tech Stack**: Built with React Native, Hardhat, Ethers, and TypeScript to streamline mobile dApp development.\n\n#### Key Features\n\n- 🧑‍💻 **Contract Debugger**: Inspect smart contract details such as address, balance, variables, and functions. It also allows real-time interaction with contracts, making development more efficient.\n\n![Contract Debugger](https://dewdrip.github.io/eth-mobile/assets/debugger.png)\n\n- 💳 **In-App Wallet**: A secure mobile crypto wallet for managing funds, signing transactions, and interacting with multiple EVM-compatible chains.\n\n![Wallet](https://dewdrip.github.io/eth-mobile/assets/wallet.png)\n\n- ✅ **Contract Hot Reload**: Automatically updates the mobile frontend to reflect changes made to smart contracts during development.\n- 🪝 **Custom Hooks**: A collection of React hooks with TypeScript autocompletion, simplifying contract interaction in your mobile app.\n- 🧱 **Web3 Components**: Pre-built components for quickly building mobile dApp frontends.\n\nBy providing these tools, ETH Mobile drastically reduces the time and effort required to build mobile dApps, making development more accessible to both new and experienced developers.\n\n### Project Roadmap\n\n**Phase 1: Core Development (Completed)**\n\n- Implemented in-built wallet, contract hot reload, contract debugger, and custom hooks.\n\n**Phase 2: Expansion (Next 3-6 months)**\n\n- Comprehensive project documentation for easy adoption.\n- Convert existing web dApps to mobile dApps by collaborating with founders.\n- Build additional components, hooks, and utilities for complex mobile dApp frontends.\n- Support zkApp development\n\n### Team\n\n**Valentine Orga**: Lead Developer and Blockchain Architect with extensive experience in Ethereum and EVM-compatible smart contract development. I am passionate about mobile dApp innovation and have a proven track record in building decentralized applications for both web and mobile platforms.\n\n### Why Support Us?\n\n**ETH Mobile** is crucial for the future of mobile dApp development on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains. By supporting ETH Mobile, you are contributing to the growth of mobile decentralized applications, helping developers deliver seamless and user-friendly dApps. ETH Mobile not only simplifies development but also enhances mobile accessibility, ensuring users can interact with dApps effortlessly.\n\nIf you believe in the future of mobile-first dApps on Ethereum and beyond, **DONATE TO SUPPORT ETH MOBILE**!\n\n### Links & Resources\n\n- [Github Repo](https://github.com/dewdrip/eth-mobile)\n- [X](https://x.com/ValentineOrga)\n",
