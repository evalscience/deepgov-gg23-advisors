  "summary": "DeFiScan is an open-source framework and analytics dashboard designed to assess the decentralization level of EVM DeFi applications. It aims to provide transparency and verifiable insights into the maturity and risk metrics of DeFi platforms, promoting informed decision-making for users and developers. The project has reviewed multiple protocols and plans to expand its reach to cover 90% of DeFi's TVL on EVM chains by Q3 2025. The grant funds will be used to enhance the user experience, develop an API, and support community review programs.",
  "review": "The DeFiScan project presents a compelling case for funding within the GG23 OSS - Developer Tooling and Libraries round. It aligns well with the round's focus on tools that empower developers by providing a framework that enhances transparency and security in the DeFi space. The project has demonstrated significant community engagement, with ongoing reviews of multiple protocols and participation in major Ethereum-centric events. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics on its impact and clearer articulation of how the grant will specifically enhance its capabilities. The project's roadmap is ambitious, aiming for broad coverage of DeFi's TVL and strategic partnerships, which aligns with the constitutional principles of maximizing impact and promoting long-term systemic change. Overall, DeFiScan is a strong candidate for funding, with room for improvement in detailing its impact metrics and specific use of grant funds.",
