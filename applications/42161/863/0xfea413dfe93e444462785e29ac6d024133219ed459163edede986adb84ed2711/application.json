A centralization risk scoring system based on a scale of \"High\", \"Medium\" and \"Low\" severity risks.\n\n2. A formalization of the decentralization stages which relates directly to the risk scores achieved by a DeFi protocol.\n\nIn fine, DeFiScan addresses transparency problems in DeFi and sets decentralized  standards for DeFi builders.",

We enable more security to the  protocol and its users as the team took action after learning from our report that some of their contracts were unverified: (https://x.com/haydenzadams/status/1884715908683157917).\n\nAnother example:  Our framework requires DeFi protocol to offer multiple front-end (to secure accessibility of the services) and this has been applied by Ajna V2 and Velodrome-v2 as we were reviewing their protocols.",
