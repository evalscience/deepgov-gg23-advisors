  "summary": "DeFiScan is an open-source framework and analytics dashboard designed to assess the decentralization level of EVM DeFi applications. It aims to provide transparency and enhance security in the DeFi space by offering unbiased reviews and a centralization risk scoring system. The project has a clear roadmap, including plans to review 90% of DeFi's TVL on EVM chains by Q3 2025, and has received support from the Ethereum Foundation and other community programs.",
  "review": "The DeFiScan project presents a robust framework for enhancing transparency and security in the DeFi ecosystem. It addresses a significant need for unbiased assessments of decentralization in DeFi protocols, which is crucial for both developers and users. The project has demonstrated its impact through practical examples, such as influencing Uniswap V3 to verify their contracts. The team has a clear plan for future development, including expanding their review coverage and improving their platform's user experience. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics on the project's current impact and usage within the developer community, as well as a clearer explanation of how the grant funds will specifically contribute to achieving their stated goals.",
