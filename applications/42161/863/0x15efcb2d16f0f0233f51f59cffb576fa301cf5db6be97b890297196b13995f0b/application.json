        "description": "growthepie is a public goods data platform designed specifically for the Ethereum ecosystem to understand which chains, apps and more build on Ethereum. We also develop independent public goods trackers for Glo Dollar and Octant.\n\nThe mission is to empower builders and users alike by providing them with a comprehensive overview of fundamental metrics, more easy-to-understand onchain data, and educational resources, to help them make informed decisions when selecting their chain to build and interact on.\n\nWe believe that real-world impact can only be achieved when people can select and use projects that fulfil their actual needs and when they know what‚Äôs out there. We achieve this through better transparency and overview of what‚Äôs happening in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe platform is and will stay free to use, striving to improve everyday through better UX and meaningful data. We do not have any VC funding or angel investment, nor do we have any subscription fee to access more data by individual users. All data can be seen and used (also via our API) free of charge. We are also completely open-source.\n\n![growthepie Landing Page](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-landingpage.gif \"growthepie Landing Page\")\n\n## In short\n\nCore Platform Features:\n- Fundamental metrics and chain comparisons: We provide key metrics categorized into Activity, Value Locked, and Convenience.\n- Economics view: We have a dedicated economics page to compare chains and their economic data, like revenue, cost, profit and margins.\n- Application metrics: See which applications run on different chains and what their usage look like.\n- Usage Cateogories: This tool offers a detailed categorization of blockspace usage across different chains showing how each chain is being used.\n- Single chain metrics: Comprehensive, chain-specific pages that showcase all metrics for a particular chain.\n- Data Availability metrics: Learn which chain use different data availability solutions and how much data they are posting and paying for it.\n- Public Goods Trackers: We develop and maintain several public goods trackers, like Optimism RetroFunding, Octant Epochs, and Glo Dollar holdings.\n\n## Our goals and usage of funds üöÄ\n\n- Addition of more current and upcoming chains in the Ethereum ecosystem\n\n- Changing and maintaining infrastructure, adapting our Blockspace Explorer to Open Labels Initiative's data standard once the first version is defined\n\n- Improving the platform for usability and easy-to-understand data\n\n\n## What can you do on our platform currently? üßê\n\nCurrently, we provide a curated and easy-to-understand set of metrics for Layer 2s, focusing on ~30 chains, incl. Arbitrum One, Base, Blast, Celo, Derive, OP Mainnet, Orderly, Immutable X, Ink, Linea, Loopring, Manta Pacific, Mantle, Metis, Mode, Polygon zkEVM, Redstone, Scroll, Starknet, Taiko, zkSync Era, Zora, and more. All data has been pulled via RPC, some has been received from data providers or is linked to other sources. However, we are changing more and more to connecting our own RPC for better data quality and reliability.\n\n\n### Fundamental metrics Analysis\n\n**Activity**\n\n- Daily Active Addresses: The number of unique daily addresses that interacted with a chain.\n\n- Transaction Count: The number of daily transactions. We try to only count transactions that are executed by users/smart contracts, excluding system transactions.\n\n- Throughput: The number of daily transactions. We try to only count transactions that are executed by users/smart contracts - no system transactions.\n\n**Value Locked**\n\n- Stablecoin Market Cap: The sum of stablecoins that are locked on the chain.\n\n- Total Value Locked: The sum of all funds locked on the chain.\n\n**Convenience**\n\n- Transaction Costs: The median amount that is paid per transaction.\n\n### Economics page\n\nOur Economics Page provides a comprehensive overview including table and historic charts of key financial metrics for all supported chains, including revenue, costs, profit, and margin. This allows users to gauge the economic health of the chain.\n\n**Individual Metrics**\n\n- Fees Paid by Users: The sum of fees that were paid by users of the chain in gas fees or, in the case of chains like Immutable X, the amount of fees that were paid to the protocol wallet.\n\n- Rent Paid to L1: The gas fees paid by L2s to post transaction data & verification states onto Ethereum.\n\n- Onchain Profit: The net profit of L2s, accounting for revenues as L2 gas fees collected and expenses as posting transaction data & verification states onto Ethereum.\n\n- Fully Diluted Valuation: The theoretical market cap of a token if all its planned tokens (total supply) were issued at the current price.\n\n- Market Cap: The total value of all circulating tokens, calculated by multiplying the current price of a single token by the total number of tokens in circulation.\n\n\n![growthepie Economics](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-economics.gif \"growthepie Economics\")\n\n### fees.growthepie.xyz\n\nWe also have a more detailed and realtime updating fees page: https://fees.growthepie.xyz - allowing to view median and average fees, swap fees, transfer fees, transaction per second, and throughput live. \n\n![growthepie Realtime Fees](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-fees.gif \"growthepie Realtime Fees\")\n\n\n### Blockspace Explorer\n\nWith one rollup launching after the other, it is hard for users to understand what‚Äôs going on in the Ethereum ecosystem. Helping to analyze blockspace changes this trajectory.\n\n![growthepie Blockspace Explorer](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-blockspaceoverview.gif \"growthepie Blockspace Overview\")\n\nOur platform offers the following to Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem:\n\n- An overview of chains‚Äô high-level blockspace usage. All expressed in shares of a chain‚Äôs total blockspace. In simple words: For which purpose are these Layers 2s built and what do people do with them?\n\n- A comparison for available Layer 2s for their usage in specific categories, ranging from NFT, Token Transfers to Socials applications. For each of these and more categories, we have a set of subcategories that allow you to filter in more detail and compare which category is more used on which chain.\n\n- For each category/subcategory, users can see the most-used smart contracts ranked in a table and make sense of how the chain is being used\n\n![growthepie Blockspace Comparison](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-blockspacecomparison.gif \"growthepie Blockspace Comparison\")\n\n\n### Smart Contract Labeling based Open Labels Initiative (OLI) standard\n\nIn order to ensure that people can make sense of all these Ethereum scaling solutions, we need to label smart contracts, i.e. projects that launch on the respective Layer 2s or Layer 3s. Currently, we label smart contracts ourselves. This is a huge effort, as every smart contract that is deployed needs to be researched, labeled, and verified. For this reason, we are building the Open Labels Initiative as one of the founding members, together with other contributors. This initiative aims to tackle the issue of isolated and non-standardized contract and wallet labeling datasets within the blockchain data community. By introducing a standardized data model for smart contract and wallet labels we advocate for the consolidation into a single, universally accessible data structure utilized by various data providers. Additionally, we also aim to function as an aggregator for labeling tools (i.e. automated ERC detection, activity tagging, etc.). All smart contracts that we labeled can be used by any third party for their own analysis or database. \n\n\n### labels.growthepie.xyz\n\nWe recently launched our new labels page, dedicated to showcasing all labels on supported Layer 2 chains: https://labels.growthepie.xyz \n\n![growthepie Single Chain Metrics](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-labels.gif \"growthepie Labels\")\n\nUsers have the ability to filter down by chain, categories, subcategories as well as individual projects and types of contracts. Sorting by Transaction Count, Activity, etc. can also help identify new and exciting contracts/projects as well.\n\n\n### Single Chain Metrics All-in-One\n\nYou can compare chains amongst each other with all the metrics mentioned. Additionally, you have chain-specific pages that allow you to have a glance at all metrics for a chain at once.\n\n![growthepie Single Chain Metrics](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-singlechain.gif \"growthepie Single Chain Metrics\")\n\n\n### Retroactive Public Goods Fund Tracker\n\nIn addition to aggregating data and providing fundamental metrics, we tracked projects and their impact for Optimism‚Äôs RPGF3 as well as Octant Epoch 3 & 4. This was the start of tracking impact for projects and providing transparency and overview of their achievements and previous funding.\n\nAdditionally, we worked with Glo Dollar to design a tracker for the main platform to showcase the Glo Dollar holders and spread the word about the stablecoin that funds public goods. \n\n\n## The team (brief intro of each member) üë•\n\n- **Matthias**: Started to work in the blockchain/EVM space 5 years ago with his master thesis on the ‚ÄúImplementation of blockchain-based local energy markets‚Äù.

      "description": "growthepie is a public goods data platform designed specifically for the Ethereum ecosystem to understand which chains, apps and more build on Ethereum. We also develop independent public goods trackers for Glo Dollar and Octant.\n\nThe mission is to empower builders and users alike by providing them with a comprehensive overview of fundamental metrics, more easy-to-understand onchain data, and educational resources, to help them make informed decisions when selecting their chain to build and interact on.\n\nWe believe that real-world impact can only be achieved when people can select and use projects that fulfil their actual needs and when they know what‚Äôs out there. We achieve this through better transparency and overview of what‚Äôs happening in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe platform is and will stay free to use, striving to improve everyday through better UX and meaningful data. We do not have any VC funding or angel investment, nor do we have any subscription fee to access more data by individual users. All data can be seen and used (also via our API) free of charge. We are also completely open-source.\n\n![growthepie Landing Page](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-landingpage.gif \"growthepie Landing Page\")\n\n## In short\n\nCore Platform Features:\n- Fundamental metrics and chain comparisons: We provide key metrics categorized into Activity, Value Locked, and Convenience.\n- Economics view: We have a dedicated economics page to compare chains and their economic data, like revenue, cost, profit and margins.\n- Application metrics: See which applications run on different chains and what their usage look like.\n- Usage Cateogories: This tool offers a detailed categorization of blockspace usage across different chains showing how each chain is being used.\n- Single chain metrics: Comprehensive, chain-specific pages that showcase all metrics for a particular chain.\n- Data Availability metrics: Learn which chain use different data availability solutions and how much data they are posting and paying for it.\n- Public Goods Trackers: We develop and maintain several public goods trackers, like Optimism RetroFunding, Octant Epochs, and Glo Dollar holdings.\n\n## Our goals and usage of funds üöÄ\n\n- Addition of more current and upcoming chains in the Ethereum ecosystem\n\n- Changing and maintaining infrastructure, adapting our Blockspace Explorer to Open Labels Initiative's data standard once the first version is defined\n\n- Improving the platform for usability and easy-to-understand data\n\n\n## What can you do on our platform currently? üßê\n\nCurrently, we provide a curated and easy-to-understand set of metrics for Layer 2s, focusing on ~30 chains, incl. Arbitrum One, Base, Blast, Celo, Derive, OP Mainnet, Orderly, Immutable X, Ink, Linea, Loopring, Manta Pacific, Mantle, Metis, Mode, Polygon zkEVM, Redstone, Scroll, Starknet, Taiko, zkSync Era, Zora, and more. All data has been pulled via RPC, some has been received from data providers or is linked to other sources. However, we are changing more and more to connecting our own RPC for better data quality and reliability.\n\n\n### Fundamental metrics Analysis\n\n**Activity**\n\n- Daily Active Addresses: The number of unique daily addresses that interacted with a chain.\n\n- Transaction Count: The number of daily transactions. We try to only count transactions that are executed by users/smart contracts, excluding system transactions.\n\n- Throughput: The number of daily transactions. We try to only count transactions that are executed by users/smart contracts - no system transactions.\n\n**Value Locked**\n\n- Stablecoin Market Cap: The sum of stablecoins that are locked on the chain.\n\n- Total Value Locked: The sum of all funds locked on the chain.\n\n**Convenience**\n\n- Transaction Costs: The median amount that is paid per transaction.\n\n### Economics page\n\nOur Economics Page provides a comprehensive overview including table and historic charts of key financial metrics for all supported chains, including revenue, costs, profit, and margin. This allows users to gauge the economic health of the chain.\n\n**Individual Metrics**\n\n- Fees Paid by Users: The sum of fees that were paid by users of the chain in gas fees or, in the case of chains like Immutable X, the amount of fees that were paid to the protocol wallet.\n\n- Rent Paid to L1: The gas fees paid by L2s to post transaction data & verification states onto Ethereum.\n\n- Onchain Profit: The net profit of L2s, accounting for revenues as L2 gas fees collected and expenses as posting transaction data & verification states onto Ethereum.\n\n- Fully Diluted Valuation: The theoretical market cap of a token if all its planned tokens (total supply) were issued at the current price.\n\n- Market Cap: The total value of all circulating tokens, calculated by multiplying the current price of a single token by the total number of tokens in circulation.\n\n\n![growthepie Economics](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-economics.gif \"growthepie Economics\")\n\n### fees.growthepie.xyz\n\nWe also have a more detailed and realtime updating fees page: https://fees.growthepie.xyz - allowing to view median and average fees, swap fees, transfer fees, transaction per second, and throughput live. \n\n![growthepie Realtime Fees](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-fees.gif \"growthepie Realtime Fees\")\n\n\n### Blockspace Explorer\n\nWith one rollup launching after the other, it is hard for users to understand what‚Äôs going on in the Ethereum ecosystem. Helping to analyze blockspace changes this trajectory.\n\n![growthepie Blockspace Explorer](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-blockspaceoverview.gif \"growthepie Blockspace Overview\")\n\nOur platform offers the following to Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem:\n\n- An overview of chains‚Äô high-level blockspace usage. All expressed in shares of a chain‚Äôs total blockspace. In simple words: For which purpose are these Layers 2s built and what do people do with them?\n\n- A comparison for available Layer 2s for their usage in specific categories, ranging from NFT, Token Transfers to Socials applications. For each of these and more categories, we have a set of subcategories that allow you to filter in more detail and compare which category is more used on which chain.\n\n- For each category/subcategory, users can see the most-used smart contracts ranked in a table and make sense of how the chain is being used\n\n![growthepie Blockspace Comparison](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-blockspacecomparison.gif \"growthepie Blockspace Comparison\")\n\n\n### Smart Contract Labeling based Open Labels Initiative (OLI) standard\n\nIn order to ensure that people can make sense of all these Ethereum scaling solutions, we need to label smart contracts, i.e. projects that launch on the respective Layer 2s or Layer 3s. Currently, we label smart contracts ourselves. This is a huge effort, as every smart contract that is deployed needs to be researched, labeled, and verified. For this reason, we are building the Open Labels Initiative as one of the founding members, together with other contributors. This initiative aims to tackle the issue of isolated and non-standardized contract and wallet labeling datasets within the blockchain data community. By introducing a standardized data model for smart contract and wallet labels we advocate for the consolidation into a single, universally accessible data structure utilized by various data providers. Additionally, we also aim to function as an aggregator for labeling tools (i.e. automated ERC detection, activity tagging, etc.). All smart contracts that we labeled can be used by any third party for their own analysis or database. \n\n\n### labels.growthepie.xyz\n\nWe recently launched our new labels page, dedicated to showcasing all labels on supported Layer 2 chains: https://labels.growthepie.xyz \n\n![growthepie Single Chain Metrics](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-labels.gif \"growthepie Labels\")\n\nUsers have the ability to filter down by chain, categories, subcategories as well as individual projects and types of contracts. Sorting by Transaction Count, Activity, etc. can also help identify new and exciting contracts/projects as well.\n\n\n### Single Chain Metrics All-in-One\n\nYou can compare chains amongst each other with all the metrics mentioned. Additionally, you have chain-specific pages that allow you to have a glance at all metrics for a chain at once.\n\n![growthepie Single Chain Metrics](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-singlechain.gif \"growthepie Single Chain Metrics\")\n\n\n### Retroactive Public Goods Fund Tracker\n\nIn addition to aggregating data and providing fundamental metrics, we tracked projects and their impact for Optimism‚Äôs RPGF3 as well as Octant Epoch 3 & 4. This was the start of tracking impact for projects and providing transparency and overview of their achievements and previous funding.\n\nAdditionally, we worked with Glo Dollar to design a tracker for the main platform to showcase the Glo Dollar holders and spread the word about the stablecoin that funds public goods. \n\n\n## The team (brief intro of each member) üë•\n\n- **Matthias**: Started to work in the blockchain/EVM space 5 years ago with his master thesis on the ‚ÄúImplementation of blockchain-based local energy markets‚Äù.
