  "summary": "The Builders Garden project aims to simplify the development of mini-apps and Farcaster Frames by providing guided READMEs and a flexible Next.js starter kit. The project has received some community recognition, including GitHub stars and mentions on Farcaster. The team is focused on expanding their tooling, with recent integrations like XMTP, and plans to use the grant to further develop their resources.",
  "review": "The Builders Garden project presents a promising initiative to enhance the development process for mini-apps and Farcaster Frames. The project aligns well with the round's focus on developer tooling and libraries, as it aims to reduce development barriers and improve efficiency through guided resources and templates. The project has demonstrated some community support, evidenced by GitHub stars and mentions on Farcaster, which indicates a level of engagement and interest from the developer community. However, the application lacks detailed metrics or examples of how the project specifically enhances security or significantly reduces development barriers, which are key requirements of the round. Additionally, while the project mentions a roadmap, it lacks specific details on how the grant funds will be utilized to achieve these goals. The application could benefit from a more comprehensive explanation of its impact and a clearer plan for the use of funds.",
