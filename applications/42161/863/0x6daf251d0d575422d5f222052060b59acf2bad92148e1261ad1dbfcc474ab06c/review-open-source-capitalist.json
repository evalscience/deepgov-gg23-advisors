  "summary": "The Builders Garden project aims to simplify the development of mini-apps and Farcaster Frames by providing guided READMEs and a flexible Next.js starter kit. The project has received some community recognition, including GitHub stars and shout-outs on Farcaster. The team is focused on expanding their tooling, with recent integrations like XMTP, and plans to use grant funds to further develop their resources.",
  "review": "The Builders Garden project aligns well with the round's focus on developer tooling and libraries. It addresses development barriers by providing templates and tools that reduce the need for boilerplate code, thus improving efficiency. The project has demonstrated some community support, evidenced by GitHub stars and positive mentions on Farcaster. However, the application lacks detailed metrics on how the tools specifically enhance security or significantly reduce development barriers. The roadmap is somewhat vague, with a general focus on expanding tooling without specific milestones or timelines. The project is open-source, aligning with Gitcoin's principles, but the application could benefit from more detailed information on the project's impact and future plans.",
