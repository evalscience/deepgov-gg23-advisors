  "summary": "Lighthouse is a perpetual storage protocol built on IPFS and Filecoin, designed to provide developers with a reliable and efficient way to store data permanently. The project supports EVM Chains for payments, signature, authentication, and token-gating, ensuring data immutability and continuous storage through the Filecoin network. Lighthouse aims to reduce development barriers by offering SDKs in popular languages like JS and Python, allowing developers to access decentralized storage without complex infrastructure setup. The project is trusted by thousands of dapps, with significant data storage metrics, and plans to use grant funds to scale engineering capabilities and enhance SDK functionalities.",
  "review": "The Lighthouse project presents a compelling case for funding within the GG23 OSS - Developer Tooling and Libraries round. It aligns well with the round's focus on empowering developers through tools that reduce barriers and improve efficiency. The project demonstrates strong community support, with over 19,000 users and endorsements from major blockchain networks like Polygon and Astar Network. The use of IPFS and Filecoin for data storage ensures security and immutability, addressing key concerns in the Web3 ecosystem. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on how it integrates environmental sustainability principles, as outlined in the model specification. Additionally, while the project shows promise in scaling and enhancing its offerings, a clearer roadmap with specific milestones and timelines would strengthen its case for funding.",
