  "summary": "Lighthouse is a perpetual storage system designed for AI, DePin, and NFTs, utilizing IPFS and Filecoin for data storage. It offers SDKs in popular languages like JS and Python, enabling developers to integrate decentralized storage solutions easily. The project aims to reduce development time and complexity, providing a user-friendly web interface and comprehensive documentation. Lighthouse is widely used, with over 19,000 current users and 5.5 million files stored. The grant will be used to scale engineering capabilities and enhance SDK functionalities, particularly in Python, to support larger data sizes and more complex applications.",
  "review": "The Lighthouse project presents a compelling case for funding within the GG23 OSS round, focusing on developer tooling and libraries. The project aligns well with the round's objectives by providing tools that significantly reduce development barriers and improve efficiency in the Web3 ecosystem. Lighthouse's SDKs simplify the integration of decentralized storage, reducing development time from days to hours, which is a substantial efficiency improvement. The project's widespread adoption, with over 19,000 users and endorsements from major blockchain networks like Polygon, demonstrates strong community support and usage. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics on how the SDKs enhance security and specific examples of their impact on Web3 projects. Additionally, while the roadmap outlines plans for scaling and improving SDKs, it lacks specific timelines and milestones, which are crucial for assessing progress and impact. Overall, Lighthouse is a strong candidate for funding, with a clear focus on scalability and efficiency, but it should provide more detailed plans and metrics to strengthen its application.",
