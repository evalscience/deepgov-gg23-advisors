  "summary": "Lighthouse is a perpetual storage system designed for AI, DePin, and NFTs, utilizing IPFS and Filecoin for data storage. It offers SDKs in popular programming languages like JS and Python, enabling developers to integrate decentralized storage solutions into their applications with ease. The project aims to reduce development time significantly and is supported by a large user base, with over 19,000 current users and 5.5 million files stored. The grant funds are intended to enhance engineering capabilities, improve SDK functionalities, and expand Python SDK features.",
  "review": "The Lighthouse project presents a compelling case for funding within the GG23 OSS round, focusing on developer tooling and libraries. The project aligns well with the round's objectives by providing tools that reduce development barriers and improve efficiency in the Web3 ecosystem. The use of IPFS and Filecoin for perpetual storage addresses a significant need for secure and immutable data storage, which is crucial for AI, DePin, and NFT applications. The project's SDKs in JS and Python are particularly noteworthy, as they cater to a broad developer audience and facilitate easy integration of decentralized storage solutions. The project's current usage metrics, including 19,000 users and 5.5 million files stored, demonstrate strong community support and adoption. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the project's sustainability model and governance structure. Additionally, while the project has a clear roadmap, it would be beneficial to include more specific milestones and timelines for achieving these goals. Overall, Lighthouse is a strong candidate for funding, with a clear focus on enhancing developer tools and contributing to the Web3 ecosystem.",
