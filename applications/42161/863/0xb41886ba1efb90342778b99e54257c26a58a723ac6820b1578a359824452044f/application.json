It's an eventually consistent database that uses Merkle-CRDTs for conflict-free database writes and merges making OrbitDB an excellent choice for p2p and decentralized apps, blockchain applications and local-first web applications.\n\nOrbitDB provides various types of databases for different data models and use cases:\n\n* events: an immutable (append-only) log with traversable history. Useful for \"latest N\" use cases or as a message queue.\n* documents: a document database to which JSON documents can be stored and indexed by a specified key. Useful for building search indices or version controlling documents and data.\n* keyvalue: a key-value database just like your favourite key-value database.\n* keyvalue-indexed: key-value data indexed in a Level key-value database.\n\nAll databases are implemented on top of OrbitDB's OpLog, an immutable, cryptographically verifiable, operation-based conflict-free replicated data structure (CRDT) for distributed systems. OpLog is formalized in the paper Merkle-CRDTs. You can also easily extend OrbitDB by implementing and using a custom data model benefitting from the same properties as the default data models provided by the underlying Merkle-CRDTs.",
