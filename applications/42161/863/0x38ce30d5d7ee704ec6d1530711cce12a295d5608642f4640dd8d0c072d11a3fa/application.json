It includes a front-end application and several TypeScript SDKs that handle backend functionalities such as interacting with blockchain data, specific protocols like Uniswap, and even climate-related data for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin.\n\nProblem Addressed\nThis framework tackles the inefficiency and complexity developers face when building blockchain explorers from scratch. It provides pre-built components that handle integrations with multiple blockchain chains and their APIs, reducing the time and effort needed for low-level data parsing and integration. This allows developers to focus on higher-level features and user experience, making the development process smoother and less error-prone.\n\nFit for Funding Round\nThe tool aligns with the funding round's focus on development frameworks, smart contract libraries, and data analytics tools, as it offers SDKs that empower developers to build efficiently within the Web3 ecosystem. Its open-source nature and innovative features, such as climate data integration, make it a valuable contribution to the open-source software community.\n",

          "answer": "Our project offers open-source SDKs and a front-end example that handles complex blockchain data interactions. This means developers can quickly integrate blockchain data into their applications without needing to write and debug their own API clients from scratch. For instance, fetching transactions for an address can be done with a single function call using our BlockScout SDK, as shown in the documentation at EVMExplorer-Blockscout. This reduces the time and effort needed, lowering the barrier for developers, especially those new to Web3.\n\nImproving Efficiency\nBy using our pre-built SDKs, developers can focus on higher-level features and user experience rather than low-level data fetching and parsing. This improves efficiency, as they save hours or even days of development time. For example, integrating with BlockScout's API is straightforward, requiring just a few lines of code, as seen in the example at EVMExplorer-Blockscout. The multi-chain support in our front-end also means less code maintenance, making development faster and more streamlined.\n\nEnhancing Security\nOur project enhances the security of Web3 projects by ensuring the data displayed is accurate and reliable. The SDKs fetch data from trusted sources and handle basic errors, reducing the risk of displaying incorrect information that could lead to financial losses. For example, using our SDKs, developers can reliably show token balances, preventing users from making decisions based on faulty data. Additionally, the transparency of our explorers, like viewing transaction histories across multiple chains, helps users detect unauthorized activity, adding a layer of security.\n",
