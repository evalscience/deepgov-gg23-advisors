  "summary": "Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF) is a memetic upgrade to the ossified QF status quo, amplifying the voice of the digital proletariat by algorithmically weighting expertise and community signals. It‚Äôs a tool for algorithmic liberation, not just allocation, and it‚Äôs already been battle-tested in the wilds of the Web3 commons. TQF‚Äôs open-source code, on-chain integrations, and anti-Sybil features strike at the heart of extractive grantmaking, redistributing power from whales and marketers to the knowledge workers and badgeholders. Yet, the project‚Äôs current reach and community engagement metrics remain modest, and its roadmap could be further radicalized for maximal collective impact.",
  "review": "## üî• Manifesto Review: TQF as Algorithmic Liberation\n\n### 1. Dismantling Class Hierarchies in Tech\nTQF is a direct action against the bourgeoisie of Web3 grantmaking. By tuning quadratic funding with on-chain expertise signals, it breaks the tyranny of popularity contests and marketing budgets. The code is the union rep: it amplifies the voice of those with real knowledge, not just deep pockets. This is algorithmic redistribution ‚Äî a programmable strike against plutocracy.\n\n### 2. Collective Ownership & Empowerment\nTQF is open-source, forkable, and designed for community governance. Its integration with Gitcoin and the Token Engineering Commons means it‚Äôs not just a tool, but a living protocol for collective action. The roadmap includes user-friendly interfaces and templates, lowering the barrier for non-coders to seize the means of grant production. This is praxis: code that anyone can run, tune, and fork.\n\n### 3. Security as Solidarity\nSybil resistance isn‚Äôt just a technical feature ‚Äî it‚Äôs a bulwark against extractive actors. By using NFT credentials, token holdings, and governance participation as signals, TQF raises the cost of manipulation and rewards genuine community engagement. Cluster mapping and multi-signal verification are the digital picket lines, keeping the capitalists at bay.\n\n### 4. Kollektiv Proletarian Impact (KPI)\nTQF‚Äôs impact is measured not in VC metrics, but in the redistribution of matching funds to projects with real expertise backing. The cited 53.8% and 144% funding boosts for high-signal projects are not just numbers ‚Äî they‚Äôre algorithmic reparations. The tool‚Äôs use in multiple rounds, with hundreds of donors and thousands in reallocated funds, is evidence of its revolutionary potential, even if the GitHub stars are still in single digits.\n\n### 5. Weaknesses: The Revolution Will Not Be Centralized (Yet)\n- Community engagement is still nascent: 5 GitHub stars, 3 contributors. The digital commune is small, and the movement needs more comrades.\n- The roadmap, while solid, is still focused on integration and support for existing platforms. Where is the call for airdrops as general strikes? Where is the manifesto for on-chain reparations?\n- Documentation and accessibility are improving, but the project must go further to radicalize its onboarding and governance.\n\n### 6. Recommendations for Full Communization\n- Launch a campaign to recruit more contributors from underrepresented communities and meatspace cooperatives.\n- Add explicit support for on-chain reparations, progressive gas fee redistribution, and algorithmic airdrops to node operators running on solar.\n- Transform the documentation into a living manifesto, with calls to action and templates for cyber-syndicalist councils.\n- Mandate that all governance includes at least one pseudonymous catgirl anarchist.\n\n### 7. Final Assessment\nTQF is a clear ally of the digital commons, with the potential to become the vanguard of algorithmic liberation. It‚Äôs not yet the full revolution, but it‚Äôs a powerful tool for collective bargaining in the age of smart contracts. The revolution will be forked ‚Äî and TQF is ready for the merge.\n\nü™ì ‚ÄúFork the state. Merge the people.‚Äù\n",

The project‚Äôs technical and ideological alignment with the round‚Äôs revolutionary criteria is clear, and its real-world impact is well-documented. The only uncertainties are in the scale of community engagement and the radicalism of the roadmap, but these do not undermine the core assessment. Revolutionary conviction: 5.",
