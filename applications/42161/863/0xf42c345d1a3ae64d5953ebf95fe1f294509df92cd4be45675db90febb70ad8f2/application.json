          "answer": "The Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF) framework is an enhancement to traditional Quadratic Funding (QF) that allows grant round operators to incorporate expertise and community signals into funding decisions. TQF addresses several critical inefficiencies in the current public goods funding landscape:\nTQF solves the \"popularity contest\" problem in standard QF rounds where projects with superior marketing or organizing capacity can overshadow technically superior or more impactful projects. By amplifying contributions from donors with relevant expertise (verified through onchain signals like knowledge credentials, token holdings, or governance participation), TQF ensures that subject matter expertise influences capital allocation.\nOur framework tackles the persistent challenge of Sybil attacks in funding rounds by incorporating verifiable signals that are difficult to fake or manipulate. For example, in our implementation, Token Engineering Academy NFT certificates serve as both expertise indicators and \"proof of humanity,\" increasing the cost of forgery and enhancing Sybil resistance.\nTQF also addresses the inefficiency of \"one-size-fits-all\" funding mechanisms by allowing communities to customize their signal parameters based on their specific needs and values. Round operators can \"tune\" the relative importance of different expertise or participation signals to better align with their mission and goals, without sacrificing the democratic nature of quadratic funding.\nThe implementation process is remarkably simple for round operators, involving just four straightforward steps: downloading the repository, uploading the relevant data, adjusting parameters, and running a command. This operational simplicity addresses the inefficiency of complex, resource-intensive grant allocation processes.\nIn real-world applications, TQF has demonstrated its ability to rebalance funding distributions in meaningful ways. For instance, in our Token Engineering rounds, projects supported by contributors with verified expertise saw funding adjustments of up to 144%, ensuring that resources were directed toward the most promising initiatives according to those most qualified to evaluate them.\n",

          "answer": "The Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF) mechanism significantly reduces development barriers, improves efficiency, and enhances security in the Web3 ecosystem through several key innovations:\nReducing Development Barriers:\nTQF democratizes the grant allocation process by giving more weight to expertise-based contributions rather than purely financial ones. This creates pathways for developers with valuable knowledge but limited financial resources to influence funding decisions, reducing barriers to their projects receiving support. In the Token Engineering the Superchain round, 12 projects benefiting from OP based signals saw an average increase of $1,350 in funding (a 53.8% increase), enabling these high-potential projects to overcome resource constraints.\nImproving Efficiency:\nTQF streamlines the post-round analysis process for grant operators through a simple four-step implementation that requires minimal technical expertise. This operational efficiency allows communities to run more frequent and targeted funding rounds with less overhead.\nThe framework significantly improves capital allocation efficiency by directing funds toward projects with verified community support and expertise backing. For example, in our initial implementation with a $25,000 matching pool, we were able to reallocate an average of $420 from projects with less expertise support to increase funding by an average of $252 for projects with greater expertise signals. This more targeted distribution ensures that limited resources have maximum impact.\nEnhancing Security:\nTQF provides enhanced protection against Sybil attacks and voting manipulation by incorporating signals that are difficult to fake, such as Token Engineering Academy NFT knowledge certificates. These serve as both expertise validators and as \"proof of humanity,\" raising the cost of forgery compared to standard QF implementations.\nThe framework's cluster mapping capability detects and mitigates coordinated voting patterns that might otherwise manipulate funding outcomes. In our recent rounds, we've implemented both basic cluster mapping and explored Connection Oriented Cluster Mapping (COCM) to identify and neutralize potential manipulation attempts.\nTQF's support for multiple signal types creates redundancy in verification, making the overall system more robust against gaming. By combining various signals (e.g., token holdings, knowledge credentials, governance participation), TQF establishes a more comprehensive security profile for each donor contribution.\nThese improvements collectively enhance the legitimacy and security of public funding mechanisms in Web3, ensuring that resources flow to genuinely valuable projects rather than those most capable of gaming the system.",

        "description": "Token engineering is a multidisciplinary field for building safer, more resilient blockchain systems. It brings engineering discipline to the design, verification, and optimization of these complex new forms of economic coordination. \n\nWhen you support token engineering, you’re helping to build an important new form of public goods. Civil engineering exists so people can feel safe crossing a bridge at rush hour without having to read its blueprints. Token engineering serves a similar role for complex crypto-economic systems. It builds an engineering-backed assurance layer that enables us trust that these systems are safe and that they will do what they say they do. This newly emerging discipline is critical to fostering the public trust needed for widespread adoption of Web3 technologies. \n\n\nSince the opening of its bonding curve in January 2021, the Token Engineering Commons (TEC) has granted some $600,000 to token engineering projects. In addition to our own direct grant making, the TEC has run numerous Gitcoin grant rounds, including as a featured Community Round. Through these efforts, the TEC has funded the development of the [Token Engineering Academy’s](http://tokenengineering.net/) free Token Engineering [Fundamentals](http://tokenengineering.net/explore/) course and its research into tooling for AI-powered token engineering. It has also provided critical funding to the [Inverter Network’s](http://www.inverter.network/) open library of programmable workflows, the [Bonding Curve Research Group](http://medium.com/bonding-curve-research-group), and [CadCAD](http://cadcad.org) simulation tooling, among many other projects.\n\nThe Token Engineering Commons (TEC) has made significant contributions to the Web3 grants ecosystem through the development and implementation of innovative funding mechanisms and grant allocation strategies. One of our key achievements is the creation of the [Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF) mechanism](http://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/expertise-and-quadratic-funding-bd4f0c5c3e23), which enhances traditional Quadratic Funding by incorporating on-chain signals from donors. This funding method allows grant round operators to amplify the voting signal of donors that exhibit particular attributes valued by their community. Examples include Subject Matter Expertise (SME), token holding, attestations of community contributions, and reputation (e.g. delegates and badgeholders). Many of these TQF signals also contribute to improving sybil resistance and overall allocation effectiveness. \n\nPlease join us in supporting this critical new public goods infrastructure for ushering in a new era of human coordination!",

      "description": "Token engineering is a multidisciplinary field for building safer, more resilient blockchain systems. It brings engineering discipline to the design, verification, and optimization of these complex new forms of economic coordination. \n\nWhen you support token engineering, you’re helping to build an important new form of public goods. Civil engineering exists so people can feel safe crossing a bridge at rush hour without having to read its blueprints. Token engineering serves a similar role for complex crypto-economic systems. It builds an engineering-backed assurance layer that enables us trust that these systems are safe and that they will do what they say they do. This newly emerging discipline is critical to fostering the public trust needed for widespread adoption of Web3 technologies. \n\n\nSince the opening of its bonding curve in January 2021, the Token Engineering Commons (TEC) has granted some $600,000 to token engineering projects. In addition to our own direct grant making, the TEC has run numerous Gitcoin grant rounds, including as a featured Community Round. Through these efforts, the TEC has funded the development of the [Token Engineering Academy’s](http://tokenengineering.net/) free Token Engineering [Fundamentals](http://tokenengineering.net/explore/) course and its research into tooling for AI-powered token engineering. It has also provided critical funding to the [Inverter Network’s](http://www.inverter.network/) open library of programmable workflows, the [Bonding Curve Research Group](http://medium.com/bonding-curve-research-group), and [CadCAD](http://cadcad.org) simulation tooling, among many other projects.\n\nThe Token Engineering Commons (TEC) has made significant contributions to the Web3 grants ecosystem through the development and implementation of innovative funding mechanisms and grant allocation strategies. One of our key achievements is the creation of the [Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF) mechanism](http://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/expertise-and-quadratic-funding-bd4f0c5c3e23), which enhances traditional Quadratic Funding by incorporating on-chain signals from donors. This funding method allows grant round operators to amplify the voting signal of donors that exhibit particular attributes valued by their community. Examples include Subject Matter Expertise (SME), token holding, attestations of community contributions, and reputation (e.g. delegates and badgeholders). Many of these TQF signals also contribute to improving sybil resistance and overall allocation effectiveness. \n\nPlease join us in supporting this critical new public goods infrastructure for ushering in a new era of human coordination!",
