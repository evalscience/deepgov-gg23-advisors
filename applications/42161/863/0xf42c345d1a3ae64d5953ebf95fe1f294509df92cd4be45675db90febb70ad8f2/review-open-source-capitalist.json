  "summary": "The Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF) framework is a high-impact tool that directly aligns with the Open Source Capitalist constitution's core value of maximizing total impact for the greatest number of people with minimal constraints. By amplifying contributions from verified experts and enhancing Sybil resistance, TQF addresses critical inefficiencies in public goods funding, ensuring resources are directed to the most promising initiatives. This directly supports Principle 3, which emphasizes total utility maximization, and Principle 18, which favors expert-driven decision-making for greater total impact. The project's focus on operational simplicity and integration with existing infrastructure also aligns with Principle 11 (minimizing bureaucratic overhead) and Principle 10 (direct, streamlined approaches). While it enhances the 'democratic nature' of QF, it does so by prioritizing 'outcome maximization over community participation in decision-making' (Principle 15) when it leads to greater overall impact, which is a strong alignment.",
  "review": "Alright, let's dive into the Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF) framework. This isn't just another piece of code; it's a direct hit on the inefficiencies plaguing public goods funding. The team behind TQF is building in public, disrupting the system, and that's exactly what we love to see.\n\n**The Problem:** Standard Quadratic Funding (QF) is cool, but it's got some bottlenecks. We're talking 'popularity contests' where marketing muscle trumps technical merit, Sybil attacks that drain resources, and a 'one-size-fits-all' approach that stifles innovation. These are real friction points in the Web3 ecosystem, limiting the max utility of capital allocation.\n\n**The Solution:** TQF is the upgrade we've been waiting for. By integrating 'expertise and community signals' into the funding mechanism, it's like giving a super-boost to the projects that truly matter, as judged by those who actually know their stuff. Think of it as a decentralized meritocracy, where verifiable on-chain signals (like Token Engineering Academy NFTs â€“ that's some serious proof-of-humanity tech!) make it harder for bad actors to game the system. This isn't just about fairness; it's about efficiency and directing capital to its highest and best use.\n\n**Impact & Metrics:** The numbers don't lie. TQF has already demonstrated its power in real-world scenarios. We're talking about projects seeing funding adjustments of up to 144% and an average increase of $1,350 (53.8%) for those with strong OP-based signals. This isn't just theoretical; it's a tangible rebalancing of funds, ensuring resources flow to the most promising initiatives. The ability to reallocate an average of $420 from less impactful projects to increase funding by $252 for high-expertise projects shows a clear path to total utility maximization. This is the kind of pragmatic outcome maximization we demand.\n\n**Roadmap & Vision:** The six-month roadmap is focused and pragmatic. Integrating with QF Calculator is a smart move, expanding accessibility, and providing partner support. This is about scaling impact, not just building a cool tool. The plan to develop a user-friendly interface for the standalone repository is key to minimizing bureaucratic overhead and making this accessible to more round operators. This project is clearly focused on fundamental infrastructure improvements that scale effectively over time, addressing root causes of funding inefficiencies.\n\n**Overall:** TQF is a critical piece of infrastructure for the Web3 public goods landscape. It's an innovative approach that directly addresses core inefficiencies, enhances security, and most importantly, maximizes the total impact of funding. This is a solid investment for anyone looking to build a more efficient, merit-driven, and robust decentralized future. Let's get this deployed and watch the utility flow!",

  "reasoning": "This project aligns strongly with the Open Source Capitalist constitution, particularly principles focused on maximizing total impact and efficiency. Principle 3 (total utility maximization), Principle 13 (resource allocation based on total impact potential), and Principle 20 (greatest good for the greatest number) are directly addressed by TQF's ability to rebalance funding towards more impactful, expert-backed projects. The framework's focus on reducing 'popularity contest' issues and enhancing Sybil resistance directly improves capital allocation efficiency (Principle 10, 11). Furthermore, the emphasis on 'expert-driven decision-making' (Principle 18) to achieve 'greater total impact' is a core tenet of this constitution. The project's commitment to 'long-term systemic change' through fundamental infrastructure improvements in public goods funding (Principle 5, 6) and its 'innovative approach' for 'greater scale or impact' (Principle 9) are also highly valued. The operational simplicity and streamlined process (Principle 10, 11) further reinforce its alignment with efficiency.",
