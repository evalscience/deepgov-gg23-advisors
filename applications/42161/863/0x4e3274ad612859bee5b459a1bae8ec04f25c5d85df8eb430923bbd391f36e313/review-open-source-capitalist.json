  "summary": "The PLUME project aims to enable private voting on Ethereum through the implementation of ERC 7524, which allows for anonymous identities using Ethereum keys. The project has shown significant progress and adoption, with integrations in progress with various wallets and support from Mina and Aztec. The grant will be used to further develop the library, resolve existing issues, and promote the scheme through publications and conferences.",
  "review": "The PLUME project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's focus on developer tooling and libraries. The project addresses a critical need for privacy in Ethereum transactions, offering a scalable solution with broad applicability. The use of ERC 7524 to enable anonymous identities is innovative and has the potential to significantly enhance privacy and security in Web3 applications. The project has demonstrated strong community support and adoption, with ongoing integrations and contributions from open-source developers. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics on current usage and a clearer breakdown of how the grant funds will be allocated to achieve the stated goals.",
