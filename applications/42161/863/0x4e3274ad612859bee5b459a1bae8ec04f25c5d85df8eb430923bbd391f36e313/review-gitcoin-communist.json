  "summary": "The PLUME project aims to enable private voting on Ethereum through the implementation of ERC 7524, which allows for anonymous identities using Ethereum keys. The project has shown significant progress and adoption, with integrations in progress with various wallets and support from Mina and Aztec. The grant will be used to further develop the library, resolve existing issues, and promote the project through conferences and publications.",
  "review": "The PLUME project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's focus on developer tooling and libraries. The project addresses a critical need for privacy in Ethereum transactions, offering a solution that enhances security and anonymity. The project's adoption by Mina and Aztec, along with ongoing integrations with wallets, demonstrates strong community support and usage. The roadmap is clear, with a focus on developing a new version of the library and resolving existing issues. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics on current usage and a clearer explanation of the project's sustainability model. Additionally, while the project has made significant progress, the reliance on continuous grants for development raises concerns about long-term sustainability. Overall, the project shows promise and aligns with the constitutional principles of evidence-based decision-making, community governance, and collective impact.",
