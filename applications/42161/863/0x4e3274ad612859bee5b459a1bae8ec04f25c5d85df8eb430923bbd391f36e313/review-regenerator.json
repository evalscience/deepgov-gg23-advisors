  "summary": "The PLUME project aims to enable private voting on Ethereum through the implementation of ERC 7524, which allows for the creation of zk nullifiers for stealth voting and airdrops. The project has seen adoption from Mina and Aztec, with ongoing integrations with various wallets. The grant will be used to develop a new version of the library, resolve existing issues, and further integrate the scheme into more wallets. The project aligns with the round's focus on developer tooling and libraries, demonstrating significant potential to reduce development barriers and enhance security in Web3 projects.",
  "review": "The PLUME project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's objectives of supporting developer tooling and libraries. The project addresses a critical need for privacy in Ethereum transactions by enabling stealth voting and airdrops through zk nullifiers. The adoption by Mina and Aztec, along with ongoing integrations, indicates strong community support and usage. The project's roadmap is clear, with a focus on developing a new version of the library and resolving existing issues, which demonstrates a commitment to continuous improvement and innovation. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics on current usage and impact within the developer community. Additionally, while the project mentions environmental sustainability, it does not provide specific details on how it integrates ecological considerations into its development process. Overall, the PLUME project is a strong candidate for funding, with a few areas for improvement in terms of providing more detailed metrics and environmental considerations.",
