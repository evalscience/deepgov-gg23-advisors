  "review": "The EdgeOS project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's focus on developer tooling and libraries. The application highlights clear, measurable outcomes such as serving over 10,000 users and processing $500,000 in payments, which aligns with the Evidence and Measurement Principles. The project's open-source nature and collaboration with established partners like MetaMask and RadicalxChange demonstrate strong community support and usage, meeting the round's eligibility requirements. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on its sustainable revenue model and long-term system stability, as emphasized by the Sustainability Principles. Additionally, while the project shows potential for geographic equity and collective benefit, more explicit details on these aspects would strengthen its alignment with the Governance and Equity Principles.",
