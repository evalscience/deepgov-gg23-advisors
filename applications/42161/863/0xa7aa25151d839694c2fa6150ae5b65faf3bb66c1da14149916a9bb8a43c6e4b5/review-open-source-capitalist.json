  "review": "The EdgeOS project presents a compelling case for funding within the GG23 OSS round, focusing on developer tooling and libraries. The application highlights its ability to reduce development barriers by offering standardized APIs and pre-built components, which aligns with the round's goal of empowering developers. The project's traction, with over 10,000 users and significant payment processing volume, demonstrates strong community support and usage, meeting the eligibility requirements. Additionally, its open-source nature and ethical standards align with Gitcoin's general criteria. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics on developer engagement and a clearer explanation of how the grant funds will be utilized to achieve specific development goals.",
