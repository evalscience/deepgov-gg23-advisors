In web2, most companies have a \"business intelligence\" department. We are building a \"network intelligence\" capability on a foundation of open datasets and public infrastructure.\n\nDuring the last FIL RetroPGF1, we offered lessons learned from the Optimism community and provided a selection of high-level developer activity metrics to assist voters in reviewing the OSS projects that were in the round. Since then, we have expanded our data coverage to include ~150 active projects in the FIL ecosystem and onboarded new relevant datasets, including Lily, onto our platform."
