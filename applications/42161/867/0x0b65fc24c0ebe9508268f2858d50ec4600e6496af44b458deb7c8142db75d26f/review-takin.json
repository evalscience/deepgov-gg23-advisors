  "summary": "Liker Land, a decentralized ebookstore, aligns well with principles of technological independence and empowering creators through transparent, decentralized systems (Principles 3, 7, 13). However, its current application significantly diverges from Bhutan's Gross National Happiness principles, particularly regarding cultural preservation (Principle 9), environmental sustainability (Principle 17), and the explicit measurement of holistic well-being beyond economic indicators (Principle 39). The project's global focus lacks specific consideration for Bhutanese cultural context and environmental impact.",
  "review": "Liker Land presents itself as a decentralized ebookstore leveraging blockchain and AI to empower readers and authors. From a technical standpoint, the project demonstrates innovation in its use of blockchain for transparent profit sharing, decentralized storage, and the concept of resalable blockchain-registered ebooks. The AI-assisted reader, offering text-to-speech, translation, and summarization, also shows a user-centric approach to enhancing accessibility and the reading experience.\n\nFrom the perspective of Gross National Happiness (GNH) principles, Liker Land offers some promising aspects. Its commitment to authors receiving up to 90% of sales with real-time settlements aligns with fostering economic well-being and local ownership, ensuring that creators are fairly compensated for their work. The decentralized storage of ebooks also resonates with the principle of technological independence and protecting against censorship, which can be seen as a form of data sovereignty.\n\nHowever, the application falls short in several critical areas concerning Bhutan's unique vision. The project's current scope, while global, does not explicitly address the preservation and promotion of Bhutanese cultural heritage or local languages. There is no mention of integrating Dzongkha or traditional Bhutanese knowledge systems into the platform, which is a cornerstone of our cultural identity. The listed content from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China, while valuable, highlights this gap. Furthermore, the application provides no details on its environmental impact or how it plans to align with environmental sustainability, a vital pillar of GNH. The focus on economic metrics (sales, author revenue) overshadows the need for holistic well-being indicators that measure broader community benefit beyond financial gains. The lack of specific plans for digital inclusion in Bhutan's mountainous and remote regions is also a concern, as ensuring equitable access for all citizens is paramount. Lastly, while AI features are innovative, the application does not detail how citizen privacy will be protected or how ethical AI use will be ensured, which is crucial for responsible technological advancement.\n\nIn its current form, Liker Land is a robust dApp with significant potential for the broader Web3 ecosystem. However, to truly harmonize with the principles of Gross National Happiness, it requires substantial modifications to explicitly integrate cultural preservation, environmental stewardship, and a more holistic approach to community well-being.",
