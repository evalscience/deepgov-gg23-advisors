  "summary": "Liker Land is a decentralized ebookstore that strongly aligns with the principles of 'Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation.' Its core strength lies in empowering authors through high royalty rates and real-time settlements, directly challenging traditional publishing hierarchies and embodying 'Kollektiv Proletarian Impact.' The use of decentralized storage and blockchain-registered ebooks with resale value also resonates with 'Web3 abolishes landlords' by granting true ownership and resisting censorship. However, the application lacks crucial transparency regarding deployer addresses and needs to further elaborate on its governance model to fully embrace 'on-chain governance memes over traditional metrics.' The AI features, while promising for 'reclaiming time from capitalism,' require more detailed revolutionary implementation plans.",
  "review": "Liker Land presents itself as a decentralized ebookstore, a concept ripe for revolutionary transformation within the publishing industry. This project aims to 'dismantle class hierarchies in tech' by empowering authors and readers, a noble pursuit in the ongoing struggle against centralized digital overlords. The very notion of authors retaining up to 90% of sales with real-time, daily settlements is a direct assault on the exploitative practices of traditional publishing houses. This is not merely a feature; it is a declaration of 'Kollektiv Proletarian Impact' in action.\n\nThe decentralized storage of e-book files is a critical component, ensuring censorship resistance and eliminating single points of failure. This is the digital equivalent of seizing the means of production, ensuring that knowledge remains free and accessible, a true 'algorithmic liberation.' The blockchain-registered e-books, with their unique features and the ability to be resold with continued profit sharing for authors, redefine ownership in the digital age. This is how 'Web3 abolishes landlords' of intellectual property, granting true sovereignty to the creators.\n\nThe planned migration to OP from Cosmos is a strategic maneuver, a 'fork as a democratic referendum' that demonstrates adaptability and a commitment to a more scalable and efficient ecosystem. This shows a willingness to evolve the protocol in response to collective needs, rather than being shackled by legacy chains.\n\nHowever, comrades, while the vision is clear, some tactical details require refinement. The 'NA' for deployer addresses is a glaring omission. How can we verify the integrity of the smart contracts if the deployer is shrouded in mystery? Transparency is paramount for the digital proletariat. Furthermore, while AI-assisted features are a promising step towards 'reclaiming time from capitalism,' the current description of a 'basic AI reader' lacks the revolutionary fervor needed to truly automate liberation. We need to see how this AI will serve the collective, not just individual convenience.\n\nIn essence, Liker Land is a promising front in the digital revolution, but like any nascent commune, it requires further ideological hardening and structural clarity to fully realize its potential for 'decentralized hope and scaled solidarity.'\n\nðŸª“ \"Fork the state.

  "reasoning": "This application aligns strongly with the core value framework of 'Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation.' The project's focus on empowering authors by allowing them to retain up to 90% of sales and receive real-time settlements directly 'dismantles class hierarchies in tech one smart contract at a time' (Principle 1) and demonstrates 'Kollektiv Proletarian Impact' (Principle 2). The use of decentralized storage for ebooks directly combats censorship and single points of failure, embodying the spirit of 'Web3 abolishes landlords' (Principle 16) by giving true ownership back to creators and readers. The planned migration to OP from Cosmos, driven by a community proposal, exemplifies 'forks as democratic referendums' (Principle 13), showcasing a commitment to evolving towards a more scalable and collectively governed infrastructure. Furthermore, the integration of AI-assisted reading tools, while still in early stages, has the potential for 'reclaiming time from capitalism using automation and AI' (Principle 7). The support for diverse sales channels, including physical bookstores, also aligns with 'uplifting both meatspace cooperatives and cloud-native communes' (Principle 17). The project's open-source nature and community-driven features like curated book lists and open bookshelves foster 'collective ownership' and 'scale solidarity' (Principle 20).",
