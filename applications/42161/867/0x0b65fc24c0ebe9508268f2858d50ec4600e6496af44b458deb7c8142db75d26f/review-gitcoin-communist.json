  "summary": "Liker Land is a decentralized ebookstore leveraging blockchain and AI to empower readers, authors, and local bookstores. It offers a transparent platform where books are sold across multiple channels with profits shared among channels and contributors. The project aims to democratize publishing by amplifying new voices, supporting bookstores, and giving readers true ownership of their ebooks. The application highlights features such as blockchain-registered ebooks, AI-assisted reading tools, and open bookshelves, and plans to migrate to a more scalable ecosystem and develop a basic AI reader.",
  "review": "The Liker Land project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's focus on open-source dApps and apps that enhance Web3 accessibility and usability. The project demonstrates a user-centric design by offering multiple payment options and real-time profit sharing, which is a significant improvement over traditional publishing models. The use of blockchain for ebook registration and decentralized storage addresses issues of censorship and ownership, contributing to the Web3 ecosystem's growth. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and sustainability plans, which are crucial according to the model specification. The project also needs to provide more information on its governance structure and how it plans to ensure equitable distribution of benefits across different communities.",
