  "summary": "Liker Land is a decentralized ebookstore that leverages blockchain and AI to empower readers, authors, and local bookstores. It offers a transparent platform for selling books across multiple channels, with profits shared among contributors. The project emphasizes community curation, decentralized storage, and innovative features like blockchain-registered ebooks and AI-assisted reading tools. The grant application outlines plans to migrate to a more scalable ecosystem and develop a basic AI reader, aiming to enhance the open-source ecosystem by providing a transparent, inclusive, and resilient platform for distributing stories and knowledge.",
  "review": "The Liker Land project presents a compelling case for funding within the GG23 OSS - dApps and Apps round. It aligns well with the round's focus on accelerating the adoption and development of open-source dApps and apps that offer novel utilities or services. The project demonstrates user-centric design by providing a platform that is accessible and inclusive, allowing payments in both cryptocurrency and fiat, and offering real-time profit sharing for authors. It contributes to the Web3 ecosystem by integrating blockchain technology for ebook registration and decentralized storage, which enhances security and resilience against censorship. The innovative use of AI for reading assistance and community-driven features like open bookshelves further differentiate the project.\n\nHowever, the application could benefit from more detailed information on how the grant funds will specifically be used to achieve the stated development goals, such as the migration to a new ecosystem and the development of the AI reader. Additionally, while the project mentions plans for further development, it lacks a clear timeline or milestones for these initiatives. The absence of deployer addresses for smart contracts is noted, although it is stated as \"NA,\" which may need clarification if applicable.\n\nOverall, Liker Land's proposal is strong in its alignment with the round's objectives and the constitutional principles of innovation, community participation, and balanced impact. It offers a novel approach to ebook distribution that could significantly enhance the open-source ecosystem.",
