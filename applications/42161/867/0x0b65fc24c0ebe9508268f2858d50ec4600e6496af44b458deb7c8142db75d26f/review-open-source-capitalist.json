  "review": "Liker Land presents a compelling case for its decentralized ebookstore, emphasizing transparency, inclusivity, and innovation. The project aligns well with the round's goals of enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability, contributing to financial inclusion, education, and social impact. The use of blockchain for ebook registration and AI for reading assistance showcases innovation and a user-centric approach. However, the application lacks detailed information on the project's current impact metrics and specific plans for scalability and long-term sustainability. The migration to a more scalable ecosystem and the development of an AI reader are promising, but further details on execution and expected outcomes are needed.",
