  "summary": "BloomersTV is an open-source live-streaming platform built on the Lens Protocol, aiming to empower creators by providing them with full control over their earnings and expanding their reach across multiple platforms. The project emphasizes community-driven growth and open participation, offering features like live chat, real-time moderation, super chats, and content management. The grant funds are intended to support mobile app development, streaming costs, website hosting, IPFS storage, and API expansion.",
  "review": "BloomersTV presents a compelling case for its contribution to the open-source ecosystem, particularly in the realm of decentralized live streaming. The project is well-aligned with the round's goals of enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability, as it offers a user-centric design with features that cater to both creators and viewers. The use of technologies like Livepeer, IPFS, and Lens Protocol underscores its commitment to decentralization and open-source principles. However, the application could benefit from more detailed evidence of its impact and sustainability, such as user metrics or case studies demonstrating its effectiveness and reach. Additionally, while the project outlines a clear plan for the use of grant funds, it would be strengthened by a more detailed budget breakdown and timeline for implementation.",
