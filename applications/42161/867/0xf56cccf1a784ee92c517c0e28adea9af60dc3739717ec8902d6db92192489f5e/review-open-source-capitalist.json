It plans to use grant funds to develop mobile apps, cover streaming costs, and enhance its API and hosting services. The project aligns with the round's goals by contributing to the Web3 ecosystem and promoting open-source principles.",
  "review": "BloomersTV presents a compelling case for funding with its focus on decentralization, creator empowerment, and open-source principles. The project leverages Web3 technologies like Lens Protocol, Livepeer, and IPFS to offer a decentralized streaming platform that prioritizes creator earnings and community-driven growth. The application highlights several innovative features such as real-time moderation, super chats, and cross-platform streaming, which differentiate it from traditional streaming services. The use of grant funds is well-justified, focusing on mobile app development, streaming costs, and API enhancements, which are crucial for scaling the platform and enhancing user experience. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics on current user engagement and a clearer roadmap for achieving its long-term goals. Additionally, while the project emphasizes decentralization, it should address potential challenges in maintaining quality and reliability in a decentralized environment.",
