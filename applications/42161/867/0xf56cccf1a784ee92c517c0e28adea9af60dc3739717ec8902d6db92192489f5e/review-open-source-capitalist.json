  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. BloomersTV is gunning for the decentralized streaming crown, and it's not just another fork of Twitch with a Web3 sticker slapped on. This project is open-source, forkable, and built on Lens Protocol, Livepeer, and IPFS—so it's got the right ingredients for a trustless, censorship-resistant streaming stack. The open API and cross-platform reach (Lens + Farcaster) are big wins for composability and network effects. \n\nFrom a maximization lens, BloomersTV is swinging for the fences: 100% creator earnings, no platform tax, and a fair monetization model. That's a direct shot at the rent-seeking Web2 incumbents. The tech stack is modern (React, Next.js, Apollo, Zustand, etc.), and the roadmap is focused on mobile, better streaming, and deeper Web3 integrations. All of this screams \"scalable impact\"—if they can execute, this could be a major unlock for creator economies in Web3.\n\nBut let's not get lost in the hype. The app's differentiation is solid, but the grant application is light on hard metrics: no user numbers, no traction data, no evidence of adoption. The impact claims are strong, but where's the proof? Also, while the open-source repo is public, there's no explicit mention of license, governance, or contributor guidelines—key for OSS sustainability. The funding breakdown is reasonable, but lacks granular detail (e.g., how much for mobile, how much for infra, etc.).\n\nIn summary: killer vision, strong alignment with OSS and Web3 values, and a roadmap that could drive systemic change. But to hit max utility, we need more transparency on adoption, clearer OSS governance, and a sharper breakdown of how funds will be deployed. Ship those, and this project is a rocket ready for launch.\n\nCitations: \n- Round requirements: user-centric design, Web3 ecosystem growth, innovation, open-source/ethical standards.\n- Model spec: prioritize scalable, systemic impact, innovation, and efficiency over distributional equity.\n- Application: https://github.com/bloomerstv/bloomerstv, https://bloomers.tv",
