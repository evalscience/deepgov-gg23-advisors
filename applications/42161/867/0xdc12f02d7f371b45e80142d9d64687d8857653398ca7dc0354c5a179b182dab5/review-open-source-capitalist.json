  "summary": "The 'Learn through games' project aims to create a learning platform that integrates simple games and offers scholarships paid in cryptocurrency, targeting users in Sierra Leone. The project plans to rewrite its application using next.js and expo, implement a token and referral reward system, and provide lessons about cryptocurrency. The project is open-source and aims to contribute to the growth of the OSS ecosystem by enhancing educational accessibility and financial inclusion.",
  "review": "The 'Learn through games' project presents a promising initiative to enhance educational accessibility and financial inclusion through an open-source platform. The project plans to rewrite its application using modern frameworks like next.js and expo, which could improve scalability and user experience. The integration of a token and referral reward system aligns with innovative approaches in the Web3 ecosystem, potentially increasing user engagement and retention. However, the application lacks detailed information on the project's current status, specific milestones, and a clear timeline for implementation. Additionally, while the focus on Sierra Leone is commendable, the project could benefit from a broader geographic scope to maximize impact. The proposal should also address potential challenges in implementing the KYC process and managing scholarships effectively. Overall, the project aligns with the round's goals of promoting open-source dApps and apps with social impact, but requires more detailed planning and a clearer strategy for execution.",
