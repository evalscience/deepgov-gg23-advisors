  "summary": "The grant application for 'Learn through games' aims to develop a learning platform that integrates simple games and offers scholarships paid in cryptocurrency, particularly targeting the population of Sierra Leone. The project plans to rewrite its application using modern frameworks and open-source it, contributing to the OSS ecosystem. It also intends to implement a token and referral reward system and store KYC data securely.",
  "review": "The 'Learn through games' project presents a promising initiative to enhance educational access through gamification and cryptocurrency incentives. The application outlines a clear plan to rewrite the application using next.js and expo, which are modern and efficient frameworks, and to open-source the project, aligning with the round's focus on OSS development. The project's focus on Sierra Leone is commendable, addressing geographic equity and underserved populations, which aligns with the Balanced Impact Approach of the model specification. However, the application lacks detailed information on how the project's innovative aspects will be implemented and measured, particularly regarding the integration of games and the evaluation of guides. Additionally, the environmental sustainability aspect is not addressed, which is a key principle in the model specification. The project could benefit from a more detailed plan on how it will ensure community participation and governance, as well as how it will measure the impact of its educational and financial inclusion efforts.",
