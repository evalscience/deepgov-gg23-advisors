  "summary": "The 'Learn through games' project aims to create a learning platform that integrates simple games and offers scholarships paid in cryptocurrency, particularly targeting the population of Sierra Leone. The project plans to open source its application, initially built with Ruby on Rails and Vue, and later rewritten using next.js and/or expo. It includes features like organizing courses into chapters and guides, evaluating guides with questions through games, and adding lessons about cryptocurrency. The project also plans to implement a token and referral reward system and store KYC data in the backend database.",
  "review": "The 'Learn through games' project presents a promising initiative to enhance education through gamification and cryptocurrency incentives. The project's focus on Sierra Leone is commendable, addressing geographic equity and aiming to provide financial inclusion through scholarships. The open-source commitment aligns with the round's eligibility criteria, contributing to the OSS ecosystem. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a sustainable revenue model, which are crucial for long-term success. The plan to rewrite the application on a different stack suggests innovation but lacks clarity on the transition's impact on current users and system stability. The project's governance structure and community involvement are not well-defined, which could affect its implementation and scalability.",
