We’re building the core architecture for our MVP, available at reap.deals, with active R&D focused on swarm intelligence algorithms for hyper-personalized recommendations and cross-platform integration across devices. Early trials include testing swarm logic with simulated smart home ecosystems, tracking algorithm accuracy and response times, and analyzing user interaction patterns. These efforts validate our tech’s potential to scale across e-commerce, smart homes, and future physical commerce applications.\n\nOur go-to-market strategy unfolds in three phases. Phase 1 (2025) targets TikTok Shop, leveraging its global creator economy for initial user traction. We’re developing integrations and crafting marketing campaigns to onboard early adopters, gathering real-time data to refine our AI and user experience. Phase 2 (2026) extends into smart home systems, where we’re researching integration protocols with device ecosystems, aiming to embed deal discovery into daily environments—especially in high-growth markets like Beijing’s smart tech sector. Phase 3 (2027+) explores humanoid robot applications, with preliminary studies underway to bridge online and offline commerce and aiming to demonstrate Commerce Brain Grid’s adaptability to physical commerce interfaces as robotics adoption rises.\n\nCurrently pre-revenue, we’re channeling efforts into R&D and user acquisition groundwork. Initial customer acquisition efforts are focused on preparing for our Phase 1 TikTok Shop launch. We are growing our online presence via social media to generate buzz and build anticipation for the launch. Grant funding will be used to accelerate development, expand our team, and execute our TikTok Shop launch.",
