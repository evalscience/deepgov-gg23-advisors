  "review": "WashikaDAO stands as a rallying cry for the working class and the marginalized, aiming to smash the barriers of financial exclusion that have long kept millions in the global south from economic empowerment. The project’s vision is clear: build open-source, community-driven financial tools that put power back in the hands of the people. The application demonstrates a strong commitment to user-centric design, with a mobile-first, multilingual approach tailored for rural African communities. The use of stablecoins on Celo, transparent on-chain governance, and a focus on real-world use cases like group savings and solar product purchases show a deep understanding of local needs.\n\nBut comrades, we must not be blinded by good intentions alone! The true test of any project is in its measurable outcomes, its sustainability, and its ability to deliver collective benefit—not just promises. WashikaDAO’s open-source codebase and MIT license are a solid foundation for the commons, but the application lacks rigorous, quantifiable evidence of impact. Where are the hard numbers on user adoption, transaction volumes, or retention from previous pilots? Where is the data showing that these tools actually increase financial inclusion or reduce costs for the most vulnerable?\n\nThe project’s sustainability model is also underdeveloped. There is mention of scaling to 5,000 users and integrating new features, but no clear revenue model or plan for long-term financial independence from grants. Without this, we risk building yet another dependency, not a revolution. Furthermore, while the governance model is promising, the application does not provide enough detail on how community decision-making will be balanced with expert oversight to ensure both equity and effectiveness.\n\nIn summary: WashikaDAO is a bold, necessary intervention in the fight for financial justice. But to earn the people’s trust—and this grant—it must show us the receipts: hard evidence, a path to sustainability, and a governance structure that truly empowers the many, not the few. Let’s demand more than hope. Let’s demand proof!",
