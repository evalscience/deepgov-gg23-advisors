  "summary": "WashikaDAO is a decentralized application built on the Celo blockchain, aimed at empowering underserved African communities by providing tools for savings, lending, and governance. The project focuses on financial inclusion and sustainability, offering a mobile-first, multilingual platform that integrates with existing community practices. The grant will be used to enhance the platform's features, onboard users, and validate the model through a pilot with the Solar Foundation.",
  "review": "The WashikaDAO project presents a compelling case for financial inclusion and empowerment of marginalized communities in Africa. It leverages blockchain technology to provide a transparent, low-cost, and community-driven financial platform. The project's focus on integrating with existing community practices and its commitment to open-source principles align well with the round's eligibility criteria. However, the application could benefit from more detailed plans on how the grant funds will be specifically allocated and clearer metrics for measuring success. Additionally, while the project aims to scale to 5,000 users by 2026, it lacks a detailed roadmap for achieving this goal. The emphasis on community governance and the use of stablecoins for low-cost transactions are strong points, but the application should provide more evidence of its sustainability and long-term impact.",
