For the bulk of each season, Grant Ships are busy screening applications, distributing funds, and reporting results. \n\nAt the end of each season, each ship produces a Portfolio Report to communicate its progress.\nThe Arbitrum community then ranks the Grant Ships through a weighted token vote. In the following season, high-performing Ships receive a larger portion of the funding pool, and lower-performing ships receive less.\n\nInactive Ships or Ships that fail to meet minimum criteria can be replaced by new teams looking to enter the game.\n\nThe Referee Team facilitates the game and monitors the Ships’ compliance with reporting requirements by flagging rule violations.\n\n",

                "reason": "**Executive Summary**\n\nThe Grant Ships project, led by DAO Masons, has achieved a pivotal milestone with the completion of Milestone 1. This phase was marked by progress in developing the game's core mechanics and establishing essential collaborations, which set a solid foundation for future development.\n\nWe made significant progress in product prototyping, exploring and finalizing various technical solutions integral to the game's framework. This prototyping phase proved crucial for shaping our technical strategy and aligning it with the game's vision.\n\nSimultaneously, we focused on developing a comprehensive rule book, which was instrumental in providing a clear framework to conceptualize the game. This effort was prioritized over completing the whitepaper, as the evolving nature of our integrations and smart contract development demanded a more adaptable approach. The development of the rule book and smart contracts lays a robust foundation, essential for the game's integrity and future scalability.\n\nOur outreach and engagement initiatives have been productive, resulting in promising discussions and collaborations with Allo Protocol, Hats Protocol, and Karma. These partnerships are critical for enhancing the Grant Ships ecosystem and solidifying its impact within the Arbitrum community. Additionally, our Public Relations and recruitment campaign has gained momentum, leading to media appearances and increasing awareness of the game among the community.\n\n**Project Overview**\n\nGrant Ships is a \"meta\" framework for pluralistic grant-giving. Individual ships design unique grant programs. During a grant round, ships compete against each other to determine which are most effective in deploying capital. All capital deployment is measured for impact in ways that benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n**Milestone Objectives**\n\n**Original Proposal**\n- Whitepaper\n- Product Prototyping\n- Promotion\n\n**Progress and Achievements**\n\nIn Milestone 1 of the Grant Ships project, our team focused on laying a strong foundation for the game’s development. A key accomplishment was the progress in product prototyping. We explored and tested various integration options, which was essential for determining the most effective technical solutions for the game. This phase of prototyping has been instrumental in shaping our approach to the game's technical architecture.\n\nWe also made considerable progress with the rule book, achieving near completion well ahead of schedule. The rule book is essential for establishing the game’s mechanics and guidelines. Its early completion represents a major milestone for the project, laying the groundwork for consistent gameplay and player interaction.\n\nIn parallel, we began the development of our smart contract, aligning with our aim to integrate various protocols. This initiative is pivotal in enhancing the game’s backend infrastructure. The development of these contracts is key for integrating diverse tools seamlessly and ensuring that as much of the game as possible is played on-chain.\n\nOur team has actively engaged in networking and collaboration. We established connections with key players in the space, including Allo Protocol, Hats Protocol, and Karma. These collaborations are vital for the continuous growth and enrichment of the Grant Ships ecosystem.\n\n\n**Grant Ships Role Structure using Hats Protocol**\n\nWe've made notable progress with the integration of our Grant Ships contract, having successfully tested it with the Hats Protocol. Our team is also working closely with the developers at Allo Protocol to integrate their system into our platform. Once this integration with Allo is complete, it will pave the way for us to collaborate with Karma. This subsequent integration is aimed at enhancing our capability to track the impact and performance of individual ships effectively.\n\nDespite these advancements, we strategically chose to defer the completion of the whitepaper. This decision was driven by the need to prioritize other crucial elements of the project, particularly the development of the rule book. By focusing on the rule book first, we were able to establish a framework that has been instrumental in conceptualizing the game more effectively. This shift in focus was essential for ensuring that all subsequent developments were aligned with a clear and well-defined game structure.\n\nOur efforts in promoting Grant Ships have also been fruitful, with successful participation in events like Twitter Spaces by Plurality Labs, Hats Protocol Demo Day, and the establishment of our Telegram channel as a central hub for community discussion and operator training.\n\nAdditionally, we are pleased to announce the release of our first dev log report in the Arbitrum DAO discourse, marking a new phase of transparent and frequent updates on our development progress.\n\nWhile some initial goals were re-prioritized, we remain on track to build a robust and engaging grants experience. The adjustments made during this milestone were necessary to ensure a comprehensive and thorough development process, keeping in mind the evolving nature of the project.\n\n**Challenges and Solutions**\n\nThe development of the whitepaper encountered challenges, primarily due to the ongoing integration processes. The addition of smart contracts significantly altered the scope and content of the whitepaper. Given these changes, we realized that finalizing a comprehensive whitepaper requires the completion of these integrations to ensure accuracy and relevance of the information provided.\n\nFocusing on the rule book's structure during this milestone was a logical step. We dedicated significant time to developing the game's rule book, which is pivotal for guiding gameplay and player interactions. Additionally, we have initiated the process of planning and creating training materials for those interested in operating a Grant Ship, laying the groundwork for an informed and engaged player base.\n\n**Future Outlook and Planning**\n\nAs we transition into Milestone 2, we are soon going to finalize our contract development and testing. Upon completion of that, we will create a Sub Graph (or similar tool) so we have access to the data created during the game.\n\nAs the contract is being finalized, we will begin the layout and development of our front end app, which will coincide with the contract upon completion of the Sub Graph.\n\nWe will also continue work on promotion, with continued efforts in the PR field and also hosting our own spaces. All promotion will also serve as a recruitment drive as we seek people willing to learn about the game and possibly establish Ships they can propose to enable.\n\nFinally, the whitepaper. While we did have one draft complete, we decided to pull that back as the game was still under development, from a technical standpoint. As those details are now being finalized, we will rewrite and ratify the whitepaper.\n\n**Feedback and Learnings**\n\nThroughout Milestone 1, we learned the importance of flexibility in project development. The decision to delay the whitepaper and prototyping in favor of developing a solid rule book and smart contract provided a more robust foundation for the Grant Ships project. Feedback from our initial outreach efforts highlighted the enthusiasm in the community for our concept.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, Milestone 1 of the Grant Ships project, while deviating from the original plan slightly, has set a strong precedent for the future. The establishment of foundational elements like the rule book and smart contract development, coupled with proactive community engagement and collaboration, has positioned us well for the next phase of the project. As we move into Milestone 2, our focus will shift towards finalizing the technical aspects of the project and ramping up our promotional and educational efforts, aiming to build a robust and engaged community around Grant Ships.\n\n**Appendices**\n\n[Dev Log](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/grant-ships-weekly-dev-log/20191?u=boiler) - Development Log posted in Arbitrum DAO's forum.\n\n[Grant Ships Proposal](https://hackmd.io/@DAOMasons/HkC4Hib-6) - Original Proposal for Plurality Labs\n\n[Kanban Board](https://github.com/orgs/DAOmasons/projects/17) - Our Main Project/Task Board\n\n[Operator Training Rule Book Quest](https://app.questn.com/quest/850775483498725572) - This Quest focuses on Rule Book knowledge.

This phase was marked by progress in developing the game's core mechanics and establishing essential collaborations, which set a solid foundation for future development.\n\nWe made significant progress in product prototyping, exploring and finalizing various technical solutions integral to the game's framework. This prototyping phase proved crucial for shaping our technical strategy and aligning it with the game's vision.\n\nSimultaneously, we focused on developing a comprehensive rule book, which was instrumental in providing a clear framework to conceptualize the game. This effort was prioritized over completing the whitepaper, as the evolving nature of our integrations and smart contract development demanded a more adaptable approach. The development of the rule book and smart contracts lays a robust foundation, essential for the game's integrity and future scalability.\n\nOur outreach and engagement initiatives have been productive, resulting in promising discussions and collaborations with Allo Protocol, Hats Protocol, and Karma. These partnerships are critical for enhancing the Grant Ships ecosystem and solidifying its impact within the Arbitrum community. Additionally, our Public Relations and recruitment campaign has gained momentum, leading to media appearances and increasing awareness of the game among the community.\n\n**Project Overview**\n\nGrant Ships is a \"meta\" framework for pluralistic grant-giving. Individual ships design unique grant programs. During a grant round, ships compete against each other to determine which are most effective in deploying capital. All capital deployment is measured for impact in ways that benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n**Milestone Objectives**\n\n**Original Proposal**\n- Whitepaper\n- Product Prototyping\n- Promotion\n\n**Progress and Achievements**\n\nIn Milestone 1 of the Grant Ships project, our team focused on laying a strong foundation for the game’s development. A key accomplishment was the progress in product prototyping. We explored and tested various integration options, which was essential for determining the most effective technical solutions for the game. This phase of prototyping has been instrumental in shaping our approach to the game's technical architecture.\n\nWe also made considerable progress with the rule book, achieving near completion well ahead of schedule. The rule book is essential for establishing the game’s mechanics and guidelines. Its early completion represents a major milestone for the project, laying the groundwork for consistent gameplay and player interaction.\n\nIn parallel, we began the development of our smart contract, aligning with our aim to integrate various protocols. This initiative is pivotal in enhancing the game’s backend infrastructure. The development of these contracts is key for integrating diverse tools seamlessly and ensuring that as much of the game as possible is played on-chain.\n\nOur team has actively engaged in networking and collaboration. We established connections with key players in the space, including Allo Protocol, Hats Protocol, and Karma. These collaborations are vital for the continuous growth and enrichment of the Grant Ships ecosystem.\n\n\n**Grant Ships Role Structure using Hats Protocol**\n\nWe've made notable progress with the integration of our Grant Ships contract, having successfully tested it with the Hats Protocol. Our team is also working closely with the developers at Allo Protocol to integrate their system into our platform. Once this integration with Allo is complete, it will pave the way for us to collaborate with Karma. This subsequent integration is aimed at enhancing our capability to track the impact and performance of individual ships effectively.\n\nDespite these advancements, we strategically chose to defer the completion of the whitepaper. This decision was driven by the need to prioritize other crucial elements of the project, particularly the development of the rule book. By focusing on the rule book first, we were able to establish a framework that has been instrumental in conceptualizing the game more effectively. This shift in focus was essential for ensuring that all subsequent developments were aligned with a clear and well-defined game structure.\n\nOur efforts in promoting Grant Ships have also been fruitful, with successful participation in events like Twitter Spaces by Plurality Labs, Hats Protocol Demo Day, and the establishment of our Telegram channel as a central hub for community discussion and operator training.\n\nAdditionally, we are pleased to announce the release of our first dev log report in the Arbitrum DAO discourse, marking a new phase of transparent and frequent updates on our development progress.\n\nWhile some initial goals were re-prioritized, we remain on track to build a robust and engaging grants experience. The adjustments made during this milestone were necessary to ensure a comprehensive and thorough development process, keeping in mind the evolving nature of the project.\n\n**Challenges and Solutions**\n\nThe development of the whitepaper encountered challenges, primarily due to the ongoing integration processes. The addition of smart contracts significantly altered the scope and content of the whitepaper. Given these changes, we realized that finalizing a comprehensive whitepaper requires the completion of these integrations to ensure accuracy and relevance of the information provided.\n\nFocusing on the rule book's structure during this milestone was a logical step. We dedicated significant time to developing the game's rule book, which is pivotal for guiding gameplay and player interactions. Additionally, we have initiated the process of planning and creating training materials for those interested in operating a Grant Ship, laying the groundwork for an informed and engaged player base.\n\n**Future Outlook and Planning**\n\nAs we transition into Milestone 2, we are soon going to finalize our contract development and testing. Upon completion of that, we will create a Sub Graph (or similar tool) so we have access to the data created during the game.\n\nAs the contract is being finalized, we will begin the layout and development of our front end app, which will coincide with the contract upon completion of the Sub Graph.\n\nWe will also continue work on promotion, with continued efforts in the PR field and also hosting our own spaces. All promotion will also serve as a recruitment drive as we seek people willing to learn about the game and possibly establish Ships they can propose to enable.\n\nFinally, the whitepaper. While we did have one draft complete, we decided to pull that back as the game was still under development, from a technical standpoint. As those details are now being finalized, we will rewrite and ratify the whitepaper.\n\n**Feedback and Learnings**\n\nThroughout Milestone 1, we learned the importance of flexibility in project development. The decision to delay the whitepaper and prototyping in favor of developing a solid rule book and smart contract provided a more robust foundation for the Grant Ships project. Feedback from our initial outreach efforts highlighted the enthusiasm in the community for our concept.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, Milestone 1 of the Grant Ships project, while deviating from the original plan slightly, has set a strong precedent for the future. The establishment of foundational elements like the rule book and smart contract development, coupled with proactive community engagement and collaboration, has positioned us well for the next phase of the project. As we move into Milestone 2, our focus will shift towards finalizing the technical aspects of the project and ramping up our promotional and educational efforts, aiming to build a robust and engaged community around Grant Ships.\n\n**Appendices**\n\n[Dev Log](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/grant-ships-weekly-dev-log/20191?u=boiler) - Development Log posted in Arbitrum DAO's forum.\n\n[Grant Ships Proposal](https://hackmd.io/@DAOMasons/HkC4Hib-6) - Original Proposal for Plurality Labs\n\n[Kanban Board](https://github.com/orgs/DAOmasons/projects/17) - Our Main Project/Task Board\n\n[Operator Training Rule Book Quest](https://app.questn.com/quest/850775483498725572) - This Quest focuses on Rule Book knowledge.

We had 22 unique Web3 gaming projects create profiles on our app. We recruited 3 operator teams who scouted and screened project applications. These operators selected 8 projects for funding, resulting in 47 completed milestones. A total of 81K ARB was distributed in grants and 9K was paid out in operator compensation. DAO Masons served as Game Facilitators for the funding rounds, providing KYC and grant compliance checks. \n\nWe held an Arbitrum DAO assessment vote for delegated ARB voters with 5.39 million delegated ARB signal received.  We designed and implemented a community vote mechanism that airdropped soul-bound WARP tokens to ship operators, grantees and judges.  \n\nThese 2 votes were weighted 50/50 and we used the results to proportionally assign funding weights to ship operators in round 2.  Funded by a Firestarters grant, we implemented many new features between rounds including enhanced profile customization and a badging system and successfully trained the operators and grantees to use these features with an 80%+ adoption rate.\n\nFor more detail on round 1 of the pilot leading into round 2, see our Pilot Retrospective Report:\nhttps://grantships.fun/pilotretro.pdf\nRound 2 game state: https://app.grantships.fun\nRound 1 game state: https://round1.grantships.fun\nVoting overview in Rulebook: https://rules.grantships.fun/about/voting.html",

            "description": "**Arbitrum Token Holder & Community Vote**\n\nIn order to create the Arbitrum token holder and airdropped SBT community vote features for Grant Ships, we decided to solve the general case for onchain voting and developed a new protocol: \"Stem Protocol\".  Stem solves onchain voting for a variety of onchain voting configurations and performed splendidly for Grant Ship's purposes.  \n\nWe used Stem Protocol to hold a general Arbitrum delegated token holder vote. The tool performed perfectly. For the Arbitrum vote we collected over 5 million token votes from 14 unique voters.  For the community vote we airdropped around 100,000 soul-bound voting tokens and approximately 62% of voting tokens were commited from 13 unique voters.\n\n**Stem Capabilities**\nTo illustrate the capabilities of Stem Protocol, below is a breakdown of the 4 modules of Stem Protocol that can be configured to create a wide variety of polls, surveys and votes. \n\n**Choices Module:** This module defines who can create new choices within an existing vote and how these choices are managed. This can be a single-step vote with 1 or more choice or multi-step votes with multiple options and reconciliation mechanisms such as merging, branching and looping to create arbitrarily sophisticated surveys. You can also add onchain rewards or reputation to incentivize users to add new choices to existing votes, if so desired.\n\n**Points Module:** This module defines how many votes each address has available to them. Our first implementation was be the Arbitrum DAO delegated votes, but in the future, we can integrate reputational scores (e.g. Thrive points) or participation scores (more voting weight for past participation). It can also factor in staked or vested token balances or add conviction-style signaling that increases over time.\n\n**Votes Module:** This module defines what happens when a user signals a vote for a choice. Do we just add their vote to a total, or do we use a quadratic algorithm or collect a donation, bid or stake from the user? This contract could also include onchain rewards for the act of voting.\n\n**Execution Module:** This module defines what happens as a result of a finalized vote. Contracts can perform any transaction with the results of a vote, whether that's sending funds to top-rated contest choices, distributing reputation points or other incentives to voters, or creating new rounds of Ask Arb that incorporate the results from the previous vote. One use case we intend to implement is the auto-creation of a Gnosis Safe with contest winners added as signers, using Hats signergate technology.\n\nWe see a lot of possiblities with this voting protocol, that grew out of the necessity of Grant Ships. We are shopping the idea around to other grants programs now and would like to flesh out DAO-voting features that make voting easeful and effective.",

For these readsons, we replaced The Graph with Envio, which provides a much more versatile and robust indexing solution.  Response times in the app are now almost instantaneous in most cases, where before we had long delays.\n\nIt allows us to use a local indexer for development and then push configurations to a remote indexing server, drastically improving developer experience. \n\nThe configurable indexing mechanism that Envio provides allows us to trigger remote events as a result of onchain events, and we will eventually use this to create a Progressive Web App (PWA) that can alert users on their phone when an onchain action occurs.\n\nThe app with Envio indexing solution is live at https://app.grantships.fun",

The Choice module allows you set up any kind of vote including multiple choice, single selection and ranked choice voting.  One or multiplerounds of voting can be held and tallied into a single result. The result is sent to an Execution module which can automatically perform an onchain action as a result of the vote. \n\nWe used this to implement our Grant Ships Vote feature, which can be seen here: \nhttps://app.grantships.fun/vote\n\nThis vote let anybody with delegated Arbitrum tokens to split their vote across 3 Grant Ships, summing and tallying the total at the end. As Grant Ships matures, this module will be used to automatically allocate funds to ships in the following round based on the result of votes in the previous round.",

              "explanation": "Problem Statements and Solutions\n\nThis section aims to outline the problems we see with traditional grant programs and how Grant Ships provides solutions to each.\n\n### Problem: AIP Process includes massive voter overhead, risk, and lack of due diligence\n> Arbitrum's current AIP process requires most funding proposals to go up for a DAO-wide vote. This requires a huge amount of time, effort and politicking to win a grant and is only appropriate for significant funding requests, generally in the multimillions. \n\n- For the voting body of the DAO, this requires the consumption of large amounts of context to make informed votes on these massive proposals. It is impractical to use this process for smaller, targeted grants. \n- The pattern that emerges to address this is the 'Grants Council' - where a large amount of funding is given to another entity that can operate in a more agile way and make smaller, targeted allocations - leading to further challenges around transparency, reporting and capture.\n\n#### Solution: Recompose best of both worlds\n\n* Grant Ships combines and reconfigures the best of the AIP voting process and the centralized 'Grants Council' pattern. \n* It provides a way for the DAO to allocate funds toward a funding domain, and to hold elections for multiple Grants Councils to make distributions within that domain.\n* Arbitrum voters can periodically signal on relative performance of councils, automatically allocating funds proportional to the vote received.\n* This allows centralization of funds, without centralization of risk: The DAO has more influence over how funds are used.\n* Arbitrum can allocate funds without risking them entirely, instead trusting a contract built on Gitcoin Allo and Hats Protocol to steward the funds with checks and balances to keep the DAO in control.\n* This program can be used within a centralized Grants Council to democratize a portion of their funding, with levers for the DAO to stay involved. \n\n\n### Problem: Due Diligence on Grant Operations is Difficult\n\n> Centralized grants programs within Arbitrum struggle to provide sufficient insight into internal operations and funding allocations. Without external audits, it is difficult or impossible to verify and validate transactions. Audits are largely impractical. This is a risk to the DAO.\n\n#### **Solution: Transparent Onchain Activity**\n * By using the Grant Ships platform, allocators automatically have all key grants-related activity logged onchain in a transparent manner for review by the DAO.\n * Voters have a way to freeze funds or claw-back allocations if needed.\n\n### Problem: **Overhead, Waste & Redundancy**\n> Repeated actions that are performed among many circles could be delegated to discrete roles.\n   - Grant allocators are often overly focused on creating systems for recipient applications and tracking distributions in spreadsheets. They could instead be exclusively focused on scouting for and allocating to great teams and projects.\n   - Every grants program has administrative overhead for reporting, KYC/KYB, securing funding, and more. All of this could be delegated to a well-designed governance and contract system and done just once per community. \n\n#### **Solution: *Meritocratic Funding***\n- TCR voting at the end of each round lets an allocator's performance *at allocation* serve as its best bet to secure additional funding. This frees grants programs from the overhead of constantly applying for additional funding when they should be focused on effectively allocating the funds they have. \n\n#### **Solution: *Role Delegation***\n- We integrated Hats Protocol with Allo to provide clear role distinctions and appropriate division of responsibility.\n- Roles allow us to divide labor among different function calls. We now know, through immutable code, which role is responsible for which steps in the grant-giving process.\n- Roles can be revoked and reassigned as needed by the DAO.\n\n### Problem: **Voter Fatigue and Context Overhead** \n> Using a yes or no Vote for each Grant has way too much context overhead for the voting community and leads to voter fatigue.\n\n   - It's not practical to expect every voter to gain context and make informed votes on every grant.\n   - Grant recipients each have massive overhead to educate the community on why their proposal is worthwhile and also on the outcomes after funding.\n   - The high overhead cost inhibits the provision of numerous voter decision points, making more granular decisions impractical.\n\n#### **Solution: *Clear Decisions***\n\n- Grant Ships provides simple decision paths for the voter without the need for extensive study. \n- We replace massive context proposal voting with a series of smaller, targeted contextual votes.\n- Many granular decisions are delegated to representatives once, and the community only has to vote on their performance over time. \n\n#### **Solution: *Structure***\n\n- Rhythmic governance cycles create predictable, palatable demand for voter attention.\n- Responsibilities are divided across multiple roles (provided via Hats Protocol) with periodic review and associated voting periods available to provide accountability.\n- Hats Protocol roles span multiple contracts, allowing a greater degree of specialization; people can focus on what they're good at without duplicating work, absolving the voting community from making many small decisions.\n\n#### **Solution: *Isolation of Variables***\n\n- The A/B test environment provided by Grant Ships allows clean comparisons to be made between allocation strategies. The voting signal then determines the relative funding levels of these allocators rather than only allowing a binary \"yes or no\" on each issue.\n- All Ships start at the same time and allocate for the same duration before a vote (e.g. quarterly). All Ships operate within the same rules and produce comparable, documented results by the game end.\n- This provides a cleaner way to compare DAO allocation mechanisms and the efficacy of allocators.\n\n### Problem: **Undiscovered Potential**\n>  We are working in the dark. DAOs have no way of knowing who the best allocators and contributors are.  \n   - Monolithic grant programs have no point of comparison to weigh efficacy per token spent. \n   - Voters are only ever presented with the choice of continuing a grant program or killing it. This low-definition signal provides little meaningful or nuanced feedback for program managers. \n   - Without a regular assessment of performance, we aren't determining who is doing a good job.\n\n#### **Solution: *Experimentation and Adaptation***\n\n- Grant Ships currently supports direct funding via milestones. Direct funding is flexible enough that multiple Ships can try out different strategies to find out what works best. \n- Allo protocol allows the implementation of new strategies into GrantShips for additional experimentation (e.g. quadratic rounds, hackathon formats, etc).\n- Grant Ships provides an \"A/B\" test environment where we can more easily compare allocation practices.\n- Transparency and feedback from the voting community create an evolutionary factor that should lead to the best allocation strategies thriving and propagating.\n\n\n### Problem: **Friction and Uncertainty for Talented Builders**\n> Qualified builders often find too much friction and uncertainty to justify the pursuit of a web3 grant.\n\n   - As a builder trying to get funded by a DAO, a lot of time and effort is spent identifying communities with funding opportunities, researching what they need, building reputation, networking, courting delegates, generating proposals, and if they are lucky enough to get feedback on a forum, fending off trolls in the comment section.\n   - It's difficult to justify investing this time and effort, especially when outcomes are uncertain. Unless there is a clear path to getting a yes or no answer, most talent won't even enter the scene. \n   - With traditional grant programs, program managers are the central gatekeeper for prospective applicants. Since these programs are essentially monopolies, builders are completely at the mercy of a mostly unaccountable program manager. \n   - With direct DAO votes on grants, grantees are tasked with writing proposals to please the majority of the DAO (at the time of voting) and whoever is currently the loudest in the forum (at the time of discussion). Often this results in bland, omnibus proposals that are designed by committee. For contributors with a vision, this adds considerable friction as this process practically ensures their vision never comes to fruition.  \n\n#### **Solution: *Transparency and Clarity***\n\n- By leveraging Allo Protocol, we can provide a structured, predictable, and transparent step-by-step process. There is never any ambiguity about what to do next. \n- The Grant Ships UI allows candidates to fully understand the opportunities in front of them. They can quickly assess which program suits their talents. \n- Clearly defined roles and simple rules dispel uncertainty by providing transparent insight into the process as a whole.    \n\n#### **Solution: *Competitive, Merit-based Allocations***\n\n- Talented contributors have many programs to apply to. If they are displeased with the performance of one ship, they can apply to another. \n- In the voting round, ship operators are judged by the performance of their portfolio. The ships that seek great contributors will outcompete those who simply wait around for applications. \n- Ships will compete based on contributor experience. The ship that can provide the fastest response times, the best support, and even promotion will ultimately win the best contributors.  \n- Because Grant Ships splits the funding between smaller, more focused grants programs, Contributors never have to undergo the lengthy proposal process. \n- Contributions are judged once the round is complete. This allows contributors to build according to their own vision. \n   \n\n### Problem: **No Way to Win: Opacity vs Transparency** \n> Grant administrators can either invest a lot of time and energy in broadcasting their activities to the community, creating an overhead burden or they can stay more opaque and risk losing trust.\n\n- It's hard for program managers to make everyone happy. They can choose to focus on allocation at the expense of record-keeping to reduce overhead, but this creates opacity that may lead to suspicion and mistrust among stakeholders.\n- On the other hand, radical transparency is great for voters, but the program manager spends more time publishing funding decisions, outcomes, communications, timelines, updating records, and tracking transactions that are scattered through many walled gardens, among many organizations.\n- Even worse, all this work results in off-chain records that can be easily altered, deleted, or corrupted.\n\n#### **Solution: *Passive Record Keeping***\n\n- Grant Ships solves this problem by using the chain as the central source of truth. Records are automatically generated, and fully transparent to all \n- Record-keeping is a _passive side effect_ of giving grants. Onchain transactions which are linked to immutable offchain data create a mesh of rich, indisputable records that help illustrate any user's intentions and reasoning. \n- In the app, onchain events are aggregated into easy-to-consume feeds that provide full context and insight into grants program operations. \n- Additional content can be posted onchain by any actor within the system by publishing an *UpdatePosted* event.\n\n### Problem: **The Risk of Capture & Incompetence** \n> Choosing to delegate large amounts of capital to Grants Councils does not guarantee that the Grants Council will be effective or trustworthy.\n   - Grants councils are entrusted with a lot of power and authority over funding decisions and are often also responsible for reporting on their outcomes. Capture is possible, incompetence is possible, and oversight is difficult.\n\n#### **Solution: *Revokable Privileges***\n\n- Delegation of certain authorities is an effective and necessary pattern within a DAO, but there needs to be a meaningful way to revoke that authority when needed. \n- Grant Ships' integration with Hats Protocol provides revokable privileges, reducing the risk of capture and \"loyalty through sunk cost\" - see Spencer Graham's ['Anticapture'](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ)\n- Game Facilitators and Grant Ships can all be suspended or replaced by a DAO vote as needed.\n\n#### **Solution: *Accountability through Transparency***\n\n- Transparent allocation through automated reporting provides an incentive to be effective and trustworthy.\n- Broadcasting all meaningful events within the grant-giving process provides signal to the DAO for accountability purposes.\n\n\n#### **Solution: *Reasonable Safeguards***\n\n- Game Facilitators screen and approve allocator Grant Ships and, once approved, allow Grant Ships to initiate Recipient funding allocations.\n  - This can ensure DAO KYC/KYB standards are met for every recipient in a standardized manner, without relying on each allocator to do it right.\n- Checks and balances are provided because Game Facilitators approve grant recipient _allocations_, but Grant Ships handle _distributions_ at their discretion.\n  - With Allo, allocation and distribution are distinct actions and provide a 'two key' security mechanism.\n    - Allocation earmarks the funds for a particular recipient.\n    - Distribution disburses them only to that recipient.\n- Game Facilitators can apply Yellow or Red Flags to a Grant Ship in instances of rules violation or acts of bad faith.\n  - Yellow Flags are like a verbal warning, creating an attestation of the event with context for voter review.\n  - Red Flags also create an attestation of the event with context but additionally lock down the ship's ability to distribute funds.\n  - Both Yellow and Red Flags remain active on a Ship's profile until *resolved* by a Game Facilitator, but remain in the event feed as context for voters. \n\n### Problem: **Budgeting is Difficult** \n> Voting for every issuance of Grant funds, whether to a group of Allocators or an individual project assures that setting a regular budget in DAOs is nearly impossible.\n   - Without a governance framework or SubDAO that manages grant funds, only 'emergent' grant budgets are possible. i.e. Let's see what the DAO decides to spend and say that's what the budget was.\n   - Bulky grant proposals to the DAO create uncertainty and irregularity in funding rhythms. This makes budgeting difficult or impossible, as the DAO at any time could decide to fund a larger or smaller grants program, and that could change at any time with a newly passed proposal.\n\n\n#### **Solution: *Rhythm and Cadence***\n\n- The GameManagerStrategy contract can enforce a regular cadence of grant giving - a defined start time and end time for each round - that could be tied to different funding cycles (i.e. monthly, quarterly)\n- This creates a system where you could allocate a portion of sequencer fees to grants creating a reliable grants funding stream.\n\n#### **Solution: *Budgets and Funding Faucets***\n\n- Grant Ships functions like a funding faucet that can be filled by the DAO for eventual distribution.\n- Once the pool is funded, as many Grant Ships in whatever variety required can be spun up to handle distribution to individual recipients.\n  - With full adoption of the Grant Ships system it's reasonable to predict that fewer and fewer Yes or No grant proposals will need to go to Arbitrum DAO. Instead, funding streams could be designated for the Grant Ships funding pool. Grants programs could apply to be a Grant Ship and receive funding from the pool.\n  - Grant recipients can then apply to these Grant Ships to receive funds.\n  - Voters maintain influence and control through the regular voting and revokable privilege systems.\n  - This allows the DAO to create a budget for grants, that can be increased or decreased as needed.\n"

This provided a legitimate demonstration of how Allo can be integrated into a standalone app, and encouraged other developers to pick up Allo as well. Our code is available for analysis and study by other developers and we've encouraged other developers to learn from our examples and progress.

We allocate funds to ship operators proportional to vote received. We also support multi-token voting.
