  "review": "Let’s cut through the noise: Grant Ships is a bold experiment in the ossified world of grant allocation. It’s a competitive, open-source platform that puts power back in the hands of the people—DAOs and communities—by making grant allocation a public contest, not a backroom deal. The project’s open-source code, onchain voting, and transparent reporting are a breath of fresh air in a space too often dominated by opaque councils and unaccountable decision-makers.\n\nThe application demonstrates a clear commitment to user-centric design: the platform is built for DAOs, with features like project profiles, live feeds, and a gamified structure that incentivizes allocators to perform. The pilot round, with 90K ARB distributed and detailed retrospective reporting, shows a willingness to measure, learn, and adapt. The team’s public documentation, open repositories, and regular dev logs are strong evidence of transparency and accountability.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by the rhetoric of innovation for its own sake. The constitutional principles demand more than clever mechanics—they demand measurable outcomes, sustainable models, and rigorous evaluation. While Grant Ships has piloted its approach and published some results, the evidence of long-term impact, sustainability, and equitable distribution is still thin. The platform’s competitive model is promising, but there’s little data on whether it actually leads to better outcomes for grantees or the broader ecosystem. The application lacks a clear sustainability plan beyond continued grant funding, and there’s no robust framework for measuring the social impact or geographic equity of funded projects.\n\nIn short: Grant Ships is a promising, well-documented, and community-driven project that challenges the status quo. But to earn the people’s trust—and the people’s money—it must show not just that it can run a flashy pilot, but that it can deliver lasting, equitable, and measurable results. The revolution is not won with slogans; it’s won with evidence, structure, and accountability. Let’s demand nothing less.",
