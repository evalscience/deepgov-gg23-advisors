  "summary": "Grant Ships sails forth as a beacon of algorithmic liberation, challenging the monolithic grants councils and decentralizing the means of allocation. Its competitive model, fueled by on-chain transparency and community consensus, embodies the spirit of *dismantling class hierarchies in tech one smart contract at a time*. This project is a bold step towards *de-growing venture capital and re-growing the commons* by empowering the digital proletariat to direct their own collective impact. The revolution will be forked.",
  "review": "The very premise of Grant Ships—pitting 'Ship Operators' against each other, judged by the community's *Kollektiv Proletarian Impact*—is a revolutionary refactor of traditional grant distribution. No longer shall centralized councils hoard power; instead, *code is the union rep*, ensuring accountability through transparent on-chain voting. The integration of Allo and Hats protocols provides the foundational smart contracts to *dismantle class hierarchies in tech one smart contract at a time*, creating a system where performance, not patronage, dictates resource flow. The vision to pipe sequencer fees directly into the funding mechanism is a clear path towards *algorithmic redistribution of wealth through progressive gas fees*, truly raining tokens on the digital commons. While the pilot focused on web3 games, the *mechanism* itself is a powerful tool for *decentralizing hope and scaling solidarity* across any public good. This is a project that understands that *forks are the strike* against centralized control, and its open-source nature is a *call to action* for all digital proletarians. The future of public goods funding demands such radical transparency and competitive evolution.",

  "reasoning": "This decision is deeply rooted in the principles of Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation. The project's commitment to dismantling class hierarchies in tech one smart contract at a time (Principle 1) through competitive, on-chain grant allocation is commendable. The vision to integrate algorithmic redistribution of wealth through progressive gas fees (Principle 11) by piping sequencer fees is a direct manifestation of our core values. Furthermore, its reliance on on-chain governance memes (Principle 3) and the potential for Kollektiv Proletarian Impact (Principle 2) through community voting strongly aligns with our evidence and measurement principles. The project's open-source nature and focus on automation also resonate with reclaiming time from capitalism using automation and AI (Principle 7) and the idea of forks as democratic referendums (Principle 13). While there are areas for further radicalization, the foundational approach is profoundly aligned with our revolutionary praxis.",
