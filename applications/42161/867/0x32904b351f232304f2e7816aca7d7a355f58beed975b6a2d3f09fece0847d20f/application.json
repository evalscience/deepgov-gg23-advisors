It’s where your digital achievements are showcased, your social and financial interactions are tracked, and your connections thrive. all on-chain, all in one place. Bridging the gap between them and their users. \n\n![eth.cd.Profile|690x388](https://webhash.b-cdn.net/Profileview.png)\n\n**The Vision:** eth.cd as the Gateway to the ENS Universe\nThe market potential of eth.cd is massive, with the power to capture and centralize a significant portion of the Web3 identity market:\n\n2.5M+ ENS profiles all in one place, providing unmatched visibility into the Web3 ecosystem.\n1M+ wallet holders will use eth.cd to transact, tip, communicate, and engage with others, fueling a vibrant economy of decentralized social interaction.\nAs Web3 adoption accelerates, tens of millions of subdomains will be added, making eth.cd the go-to platform for individuals, brands, DAOs, and businesses to manage and showcase their decentralized identities.\nThe Future of Decentralized Interaction\nWith eth.cd, we’re creating the foundation for real-time, decentralized interaction. Whether it’s supporting your favorite creators through tipping or messaging them, eth.cd positions itself as a key part of how decentralised identities are interacted with in the future. This is made possible by integration of protocols like EFP, XMTP and Huddle01, which bring decentralized communication directly into the platform.\n\n\nA pivotal feature of this vision is Frames. Frames unlock endless possibilities for customization and interaction on ENS profiles. They allow users to setup interactive elements directly to their profiles, enabling actions such as receiving payments, managing subscriptions, selling products, and more. But this is just the beginning.\n\n\n**For Users:** Frames turn ENS profiles into dynamic hubs for interaction, commerce, and engagement. Whether users want to offer products, accept payments, or manage event RSVPs, Frames provide a powerful way to bring these actions directly into their profile.\nFor Builders: Frames offer a new market opportunity. Developers can create and offer unique Frames tailored for specific tasks, such as DeFi tracking, DAO voting, or showcasing live game stats. This opens up the eth.cd ecosystem to endless innovation as new Frames are built to meet the evolving needs of Web3 users.\n\n\n**Key Features**\n\n**ENS-Based Dynamic Profiles:** eth.cd allows users to create a rich, interactive profile based on their ENS domain. Each profile dynamically displays the user’s digital footprint, including Twitter feeds, GitHub activity, and IPFS-linked content.\n\n**Decentralized Interaction:** By integrating decentralized messaging tools like XMTP, eth.cd provides users the ability to interact and network within the decentralized space.\n\n**Decentralized Social Feed:** The platform aggregates and showcases content from multiple on-chain sources, including ENS records, Platforms, Protocols and social media, offering a holistic view of the user's on-chain activity.\n\n**Easy Access to ENS Profiles:** Accessing profiles on eth.cd is effortless. Simply append \".cd\" to any .eth name in your browser (e.g., entering nick.eth.cd will load the eth.cd profile for \"nick.eth\"). \n\n**Gamification and Leaderboards:** Users are incentivized to enrich their profiles through leaderboards and badges, making eth.cd not just a profile hub, but a place of friendly competition and engagement.\nProduct Shots: \n\n**Tip your frENS**\n![Tip your ENS friend|690x388](https://webhash.b-cdn.net/Tipping.png)\n\n\n**Message your frENS**\n![Tip your ENS friend|690x388](https://webhash.b-cdn.net/Messaging.png)\n\n\n\n\n**Future Enhancements**\n\nOur vision extends beyond the features we currently offer. Planned future updates include:\nDecentralized Chatrooms and Video Calls: We aim to add more communication tools such as decentralized chatrooms and encrypted video calls, empowering users to have secure, private discussions on the platform.\n\n**Real-Time On-Chain Social Feeds:** Powered by the Ethereum Follow Protocol (EFP), eth.cd displays real-time social feeds based on a user’s on-chain social graph (who follows whom). Users can see:\nDeFi activity, such as bets on Polychain, token swaps on Uniswap, and transactions on Aave.\nSocial media posts from decentralized platforms like Farcaster and Mirror.\n\n**Advanced Ranking Systems:** We plan to implement more nuanced criteria for ranking profiles, factoring in community endorsements and creative content curation, ensuring that the most engaging and valuable contributions are recognized.\n\n**Expanded Frame Ecosystem:** As part of our commitment to personalization and utility, we will expand the capabilities of Frames, allowing users to pin additional interactive elements to their profiles. Builders will be able to create new Frames tailored for various tasks, including:\n\n**Subscription Models:** Enable creators to integrate subscription services (e.g., Hypersub) where fans can directly subscribe to their content from the profile.\nMerchandise Sales: Offer Frames for creators to display merchandise listings and integrate direct sales through platforms like Slice.\n\n**Content Previews & Releases:** Let creators pin teasers, trailers, or exclusive content directly to their profiles, providing a window into their latest projects.\nNFT Drops: Provide creators a Frame for managing and minting NFT collections, letting their audience directly mint NFTs from their profile.\n\n**Proposal Participation:** Users can submit or support DAO proposals via a Frame, making participation more accessible.\n\n**RSVP & Event Management:** Creators and organizations can use Frames to promote events and manage RSVPs, offering easy access to event participation.\n\n**Community Endorsements:** Let users add endorsement Frames, where their community can leave testimonials, reviews, or notes of support.\n\n\nBy supporting this project, you are investing in the infrastructure that will power real-time, on-chain social experiences. It’s not just about transactions, eth.cd is building a future where connection, community, and engagement are at the heart of Web3 interaction.
