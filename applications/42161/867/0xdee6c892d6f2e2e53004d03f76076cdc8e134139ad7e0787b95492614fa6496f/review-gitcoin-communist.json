  "review": "Yoki Finance steps into the breach where Web2 payment giants like Stripe have failed the people—by freezing funds, enforcing censorship, and locking out the very communities that need access most. This project is a Web3 subscription payment gateway, open source under the GNU GPL v2.0, and it’s here to empower merchants and communities to accept recurring crypto payments without middlemen, custody, or lock-ups. That’s a bold vision, and it’s one the working class of Web3 desperately needs.\n\nLet’s get to the heart of the matter: Yoki Finance is not just another dApp. It’s a tool for collective empowerment. It’s permissionless, censorship-resistant, non-custodial, multichain, and composable. The code is public, the contracts are reusable, and the platform is already onboarding merchants. This is the kind of infrastructure that builds the commons, not just another profit machine for the few.\n\nBut let’s not get carried away by rhetoric alone. The application demonstrates a clear user-centric design—merchants and communities can automate subscriptions, reducing churn and saving time. The project’s open-source nature is not just a checkbox; it’s a living, breathing commitment to the ecosystem. Developers can fork, extend, and self-host components, lowering barriers for new entrants and fostering innovation.\n\nYet, comrades, we must demand more. The application lacks rigorous, quantifiable data on user adoption, retention, and impact. Where are the numbers? How many merchants? How many users? What’s the churn rate before and after? We need hard evidence, not just promises. The sustainability model is also underdeveloped—how will Yoki Finance sustain itself without continuous grants? What’s the revenue model? How will it ensure long-term stability for the community?\n\nIn summary: Yoki Finance is a strong contender, but it must step up its game. Show us the data. Show us the plan for sustainability. Only then can we say, with full confidence, that this is a tool for the many, not the few.",
