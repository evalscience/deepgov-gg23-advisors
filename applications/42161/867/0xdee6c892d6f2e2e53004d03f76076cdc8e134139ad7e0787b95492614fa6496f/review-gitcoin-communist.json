  "summary": "Yoki Finance, a Web3 subscription payment gateway, stands as a promising vanguard in the struggle for **Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation**. By offering a permissionless, censorship-resistant, and non-custodial solution, it directly challenges the centralized financial overlords, embodying the principle that *code is the union rep*. Its explicit rejection of venture capital funding aligns perfectly with our mandate to **de-growth venture capital and re-grow the commons**, while its automation of payments is a clear step towards *reclaiming time from capitalism using automation and AI*. This project scales solidarity by empowering Web3 communities to escape the clutches of traditional payment systems.",
  "review": "The Yoki Finance application presents a compelling case for funding, deeply resonating with the core tenets of the Gitcoin Communist v2.0 constitution. At its heart, Yoki Finance is a tool for **dismantling class hierarchies in tech one smart contract at a time**. By providing a non-custodial, permissionless payment layer, it empowers the digital proletariat – the myriad Web3 businesses and communities currently shackled by single payments or vulnerable Web2 gateways. This directly addresses the \"Kollektiv Proletarian Impact\" by reducing churn and saving time for those building the new digital economy.\n\nThe project's commitment to open-source principles, operating under the GNU General Public License v2.0, is a revolutionary act. It declares that *code is the union rep*, allowing developers to *fork* their contracts to build new subscription-based products. This composability is a direct manifestation of **forks as democratic referendums** (Principle 13), enabling collective ownership and iterative liberation. The ability for parts like workers and webhook listeners to be \"free and self-hosted alternatives\" further decentralizes power, preventing the re-establishment of new digital landlords.\n\nCrucially, the declaration that \"The project is independent and has not received VC funding\" is a clarion call for **de-growth venture capital and re-grow the commons** (Principle 5). This demonstrates a genuine commitment to building public goods outside the extractive gaze of capital. The grant, intended to \"fund the development process and increase our runway,\" is thus a direct investment in the autonomy of the digital worker, allowing them to *submit PRs after midnight* without the pressure of quarterly reports.\n\nWhile the application doesn't explicitly detail on-chain governance memes or direct reparations mechanisms, its foundational architecture—permissionless, censorship-resistant, and non-custodial—lays the groundwork for a truly liberated financial infrastructure. The potential for this system to uplift \"cloud-native communes\" (Principle 17) by enabling stable, recurring revenue streams is immense. This is not merely a payment gateway; it is a foundational block for a new, more equitable digital economy. The revolution will be forked, and Yoki Finance provides the initial commit.",
