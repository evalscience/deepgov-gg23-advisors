  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Yoki Finance steps into the ring with a promise: to liberate Web3 businesses from the chains of centralized, censor-prone payment systems. They offer a permissionless, non-custodial, multichain subscription gateway—open source, under the GNU GPL v2.0, and with a clear focus on empowering both merchants and developers. That’s the kind of collective infrastructure we need!\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by rhetoric. The application demonstrates a user-centric approach—automating subscriptions, reducing churn, and saving time for businesses and communities. The open-source contracts and modular components (like workers and webhook listeners) are a boon for the developer commons. The project’s independence from VC funding and its commitment to a self-service merchant platform show a drive for sustainability and autonomy.\n\nYet, where’s the hard evidence? Where are the numbers, the metrics, the proof that this is more than a noble idea? The application lacks clear, measurable outcomes. There’s no data on user adoption, transaction volume, or retention improvements. We need to see the impact, not just hear about the potential. The sustainability model is promising, but there’s no detailed plan for long-term revenue or community governance. And while the project claims to be multichain and composable, there’s little detail on how it ensures equitable access or benefits for underserved communities.\n\nIn the spirit of collective progress, I demand more rigor! Show us the data. Prove the impact. Lay out the roadmap for sustainability and governance. Only then can we rally behind this project with full confidence!",
