  "summary": "Yoki Finance is a Web3 subscription payment gateway that aims to revolutionize the subscription economy by providing a decentralized, censorship-resistant, and non-custodial solution. The project is open-source and operates under the GNU General Public License v2.0, contributing to the growth of the OSS ecosystem by allowing developers to build their own subscription-based products using its contracts. The grant will be used to fund further development and launch a self-service platform for merchants.",
  "review": "Yoki Finance presents a compelling case for funding as it aligns well with the round's focus on enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability. The project offers a novel utility by addressing the limitations of current Web2 subscription gateways, such as censorship and fund freezing, with a decentralized alternative. The application highlights its open-source nature, which is crucial for contributing to the OSS ecosystem. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a clear sustainability model, which are critical according to the model specification. The project is independent and has not received VC funding, which could be seen as a strength in terms of maintaining autonomy and focus on community-driven goals. Overall, while the project shows promise, it requires more detailed planning and evidence of impact to fully meet the constitutional principles outlined in the model specification.",
