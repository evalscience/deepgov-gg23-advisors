  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the code: Yoki Finance is gunning for the Web3 subscription payments crown, and they're doing it open-source, permissionless, and non-custodial. That's the kind of disruption I like to see—no middlemen, no gatekeepers, just pure protocol power. \n\nThe project ticks the OSS box with a GNU GPL v2.0 license and a public repo (https://github.com/yokifinance/yoki-contracts). Devs can fork, remix, and deploy their own subscription-based dApps, or cherry-pick components like the webhook listener for their own stacks. That's composability in action—max utility, max impact.\n\nYoki's value prop is clear: automate recurring crypto payments for merchants and communities, slashing churn and saving time. They're targeting a pain point that's been holding back Web3 SaaS and community monetization. Plus, they're taking aim at Web2 incumbents like Stripe, promising censorship-resistance and no fund freezes. That's a big narrative win for decentralization.\n\nOn the innovation front, they're not just copying Stripe—they're building a multichain, non-custodial, and composable system. That's a step-change, not just a Web2 clone. The roadmap is focused: launch a self-service merchant platform, keep it open, and keep building. No VC strings attached, just pure builder energy.\n\nBut let's not get too starry-eyed. The app's user-centricity is implied but not deeply evidenced—where's the UX research, user feedback, or adoption metrics? The impact is potentially huge, but the application is light on hard numbers: how many merchants onboarded, how much volume processed, what kind of retention uplift? For a project pitching max scale, I want to see max data. Also, while the open-source angle is strong, documentation quality and onboarding for third-party devs isn't detailed—are we talking plug-and-play, or do you need to be a Solidity wizard to integrate?\n\nBottom line: Yoki Finance is swinging for the fences with a high-impact, infra-level dApp that could unlock recurring revenue for the whole Web3 ecosystem. But to really max out on the Open Source Capitalist scale, I need more proof of traction, clearer user-centric design evidence, and a sharper focus on dev onboarding. Show me the numbers, show me the UX, and let's go full turbo.",
