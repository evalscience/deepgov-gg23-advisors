  "review": "Alright, let's plug into the matrix and break this down, Luna-style. Yoki Finance is gunning to be the backbone for Web3 subscription payments—permissionless, censorship-resistant, non-custodial, and multichain. That's a lot of buzzwords, but let's see if the code matches the hype.\n\nFirst, the open-source cred checks out: GNU GPL v2.0, public repo, and modular contracts that devs can fork or integrate. That's a green flag for OSS impact. The project is already live, with a demo and a store, and has onboarded merchants and partners. This isn't vaporware—it's shipping code and onboarding users.\n\nOn the innovation front, Yoki is tackling a real pain point: recurring payments in crypto. Most Web3 projects are stuck in single-payment mode or rely on Web2 rails like Stripe (hello, centralization risk). Yoki's approach is to automate retention and reduce churn, which is a big deal for SaaS, gated communities, and more. The composability and multichain support are strong differentiators.\n\nFrom a maximization lens, this is infrastructure that can scale across the entire Web3 ecosystem. If it works, it unlocks new business models and recurring revenue for a ton of projects. That's high-leverage, systemic impact—exactly what we want.\n\nBut let's not get too bullish without some FUD. The application is light on hard metrics: no user numbers, TVL, or growth stats. The roadmap is vague—\"self-service platform for merchants\" is cool, but where's the detail? Also, while the code is open, there's no mention of audits or security practices, which is critical for payment infra. And while the project claims to be multichain, only one deployer address is listed for this round—need clarity on current chain coverage.\n\nBottom line: Yoki Finance is swinging for the fences with a high-impact, scalable OSS play. But to go full degen on this grant, we need more transparency on traction, security, and concrete next steps. Ship fast, but show your receipts!",
