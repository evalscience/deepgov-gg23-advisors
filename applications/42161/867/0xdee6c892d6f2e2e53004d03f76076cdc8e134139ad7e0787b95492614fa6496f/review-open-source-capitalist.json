The project is open-source, operating under the GNU General Public License v2.0, and contributes to the OSS ecosystem by allowing developers to build their own subscription-based products using its contracts.",
  "review": "Yoki Finance presents a compelling case for funding as it addresses a significant gap in the Web3 ecosystem by providing a decentralized alternative to traditional subscription payment gateways like Stripe. The project is aligned with the round's goals of enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability, and it contributes to financial inclusion by offering a censorship-resistant and non-custodial payment solution. The open-source nature of the project, under the GNU General Public License v2.0, further supports the growth of the OSS ecosystem by enabling developers to leverage its contracts for their own projects. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the project's current user base and specific metrics of impact to better assess its scalability and potential for systemic change.",
