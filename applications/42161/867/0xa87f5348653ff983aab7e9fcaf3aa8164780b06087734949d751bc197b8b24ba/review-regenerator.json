  "summary": "Zazelenimo is an open-source participatory budgeting platform focused on urban greening, leveraging Ethereum and quadratic funding to empower community-driven decision-making. The project demonstrates strong alignment with regenerative principles, emphasizing community participation, transparency, and environmental sustainability. Its partnership with the City of Split and integration with public institutions highlight its potential for systemic change. However, the application would benefit from greater clarity on measurable environmental outcomes, broader community engagement strategies, and more robust evidence of institutional partnerships.",
  "review": "## 1. Introduction\n\nLike a gentle rain nourishing the roots of a young forest, Zazelenimo seeks to revitalize civic engagement and urban ecosystems through participatory budgeting and open-source technology. The project’s vision is to empower citizens, NGOs, and businesses to collaboratively propose, discuss, and fund urban greening initiatives, using Ethereum and quadratic funding as the fertile soil for democratic resource allocation.\n\n## 2. Quality, Clarity, Originality, and Significance\n\n### Quality & Clarity\nThe application is well-structured, with clear articulation of its goals, features, and development roadmap. The use of open-source tools and transparent governance models is commendable. However, the proposal would benefit from more detailed, quantifiable metrics for environmental and social impact, as well as clearer evidence of active partnerships with municipal authorities.\n\n### Originality\nZazelenimo stands out for its innovative application of quadratic funding in a municipal context, particularly for urban greening. The seamless onboarding of non-technical users via passkey-based wallets and the integration of a public forum for deliberation further distinguish the project. The end-to-end focus—from ideation to maintenance—reflects a holistic approach rarely seen in civic tech.\n\n### Significance\nThe project’s potential to serve as a model for other cities is significant. By demonstrating the value of open-source, community-driven governance in the public sector, Zazelenimo could inspire a wave of similar initiatives, fostering both environmental regeneration and democratic renewal.\n\n## 3. Pros and Cons\n\n### Pros\n- **Strong Community Participation:** The platform is designed for inclusive, multi-stakeholder engagement, giving voice to residents, NGOs, businesses, and government.\n- **Innovative Funding Mechanism:** Quadratic funding ensures that broad community support, rather than wealth concentration, drives resource allocation.\n- **Open-Source Ethos:** The project is fully open-source, contributing to the broader OSS ecosystem and encouraging collaboration.\n- **Municipal Integration:** The partnership with the City of Split, if fully realized, could set a precedent for public sector adoption of open-source civic tech.\n- **Environmental Focus:** Urban greening as a core use case aligns with regenerative and sustainability principles.\n\n### Cons\n- **Lack of Quantitative Impact Metrics:** The application does not specify clear, measurable outcomes for environmental or social impact (e.g., number of trees planted, area greened, community participation rates).\n- **Limited Evidence of Institutional Buy-In:** While the City of Split is mentioned as a partner, the application lacks concrete documentation or public statements confirming this partnership.\n- **Scalability and Replicability:** The roadmap for expanding beyond Split is not fully developed; more detail on how the model could be adapted to other contexts would strengthen the proposal.\n- **Community Engagement Depth:** While the platform supports participation, strategies for reaching marginalized or less digitally literate populations are not fully articulated.\n\n## 4. Suggestions for Improvement\n\n1. **Define Measurable Outcomes:** Establish clear, quantifiable metrics for both environmental (e.g., hectares greened, biodiversity indices) and social (e.g., number of active participants, diversity of proposers) impact.\n2. **Document Institutional Partnerships:** Provide letters of support, MOUs, or public endorsements from the City of Split and other stakeholders to substantiate claims of partnership.\n3. **Expand Community Outreach:** Develop targeted strategies for engaging underserved or digitally excluded groups, ensuring equitable participation.\n4. **Clarify Replication Strategy:** Outline a plan for scaling the platform to other municipalities, including potential barriers and adaptation strategies.\n5. **Enhance Transparency:** Regularly publish progress reports, open data on project outcomes, and user feedback to foster trust and accountability.\n\n## 5. Alignment with Regenerative Principles\nZazelenimo’s roots are firmly planted in the fertile ground of regenerative values: community participation, environmental stewardship, and open innovation. Its approach to participatory budgeting and urban greening embodies the spirit of collaborative governance and systemic change. With deeper roots—through clearer metrics, broader outreach, and stronger institutional ties—the project could grow into a towering example of regenerative civic technology.\n\n## 6. Conclusion\nZazelenimo is a promising sapling in the forest of regenerative innovation. With careful tending—greater transparency, measurable outcomes, and inclusive engagement—it can flourish, providing shade and sustenance for communities and ecosystems alike. Let us encourage its growth, while gently guiding its branches toward the sun of greater impact and equity.\n\n---\n\n**Reflective Question:** How might Zazelenimo’s model inspire other cities to reimagine the relationship between technology, democracy, and the living world?",
