  "summary": "Zazelenimo is an open-source web platform designed to modernize participatory budgeting with a focus on urban greening, leveraging Ethereum and Quadratic Funding. The project aims to empower communities by enabling citizens, NGOs, and businesses to propose, discuss, and fund local greening projects. It integrates Web3 technologies for secure digital identity and transparent transactions, promoting civic engagement and public goods funding. The platform is currently piloting with the City of Split, with plans for municipal integration and platform optimization.",
  "review": "The Zazelenimo project presents a compelling case for enhancing civic engagement through participatory budgeting focused on urban greening. The use of open-source technologies and integration with Ethereum for secure transactions and identity management aligns well with the round's focus on accelerating open-source dApps and apps. The project's emphasis on community participation, democratic funding through Quadratic Funding, and multi-stakeholder collaboration are strong points that resonate with the constitutional principles of community involvement and innovation. However, the application lacks specific details on the project's current impact and measurable outcomes, which are crucial for assessing its contribution to the Web3 ecosystem and environmental sustainability. Additionally, while the project outlines future development plans, it would benefit from a clearer roadmap and timeline for achieving these goals.",
