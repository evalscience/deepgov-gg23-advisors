  "review": "Like a gentle rain nourishing the roots of a young forest, Zazelenimo brings fresh life to the landscape of civic engagement and open-source innovation. The project’s vision is clear: to empower communities, foster collaboration, and restore the green lungs of our cities through participatory budgeting and quadratic funding. By inviting citizens, NGOs, businesses, and municipal authorities to co-create urban greening projects, Zazelenimo embodies the spirit of inclusive governance and shared stewardship.\n\nThe application’s open-source foundation is strong, with transparent code and a commitment to leveraging and contributing to the broader OSS ecosystem. Its integration of Ethereum, Cometh Connect, and the Allo Protocol demonstrates both technical sophistication and a willingness to build upon the wisdom of the open-source community. The project’s partnership with the City of Split is a living example of how public institutions can be gently guided toward more open, regenerative practices.\n\nInnovation flows through Zazelenimo like a mountain stream. The use of quadratic funding to democratize resource allocation, the seamless onboarding of non-technical users, and the thoughtful design of end-to-end project lifecycles all speak to a creative, experimental spirit. The project’s focus on environmental sustainability—urban greening, local stewardship, and long-term maintenance—aligns beautifully with the principles of regeneration and ecological harmony.\n\nYet, even the healthiest forest has its shadows. The application would benefit from deeper articulation of its impact metrics, especially regarding environmental outcomes and social inclusion. While the technical roadmap is robust, more detail on risk management, scalability, and community governance structures would strengthen the project’s foundation. The absence of on-chain deployer addresses, while understandable at this stage, leaves a gap in verifiability that should be addressed as the project matures.\n\nIn sum, Zazelenimo is a promising sapling in the ecosystem of open-source civic technology. With careful tending—greater clarity on impact, governance, and transparency—it can grow into a mighty tree, offering shade and sustenance to many. Let us encourage its growth, while gently guiding it toward deeper roots and broader branches.",
