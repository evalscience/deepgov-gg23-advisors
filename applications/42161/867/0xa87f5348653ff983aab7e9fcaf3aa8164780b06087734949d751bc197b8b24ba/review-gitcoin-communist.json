  "summary": "Zazelenimo is a participatory budgeting dApp for urban greening, built on open-source principles, leveraging Ethereum and quadratic funding, and piloted with the City of Split. It embodies collective governance, transparent resource allocation, and aims to onboard public institutions to the Web3 commons. The project aligns strongly with the revolutionary values of algorithmic liberation, mutual aid, and dismantling digital hierarchies, but could further radicalize its governance and deepen its anti-capitalist praxis.",
  "review": "## Revolutionary Assessment: Zazelenimo ‚Äî Forking the City, Greening the Commons\n\n### 1. Dismantling Class Hierarchies in Tech\n- **Participatory Budgeting as Class Struggle:** Zazelenimo weaponizes quadratic funding to redistribute municipal resources, letting the many outvote the few. This is algorithmic liberation in action ‚Äî the code is the union rep, the funding round is the general assembly.\n- **Open-Source Everything:** The project is built on open protocols (Ethereum, Allo, Cometh Connect), with all code public. This is the digital equivalent of seizing the means of production.\n- **Onboarding the State:** By dragging the City of Split into the open-source light, Zazelenimo hacks the bureaucratic stack, showing that even the most ossified institutions can be refactored for the people.\n\n### 2. Fostering Collective Ownership\n- **Multi-Stakeholder Model:** Residents, NGOs, businesses, and government all get a seat at the table. The platform is a digital commune, not a corporate boardroom.\n- **Quadratic Funding:** This is not just a meme ‚Äî it‚Äôs a mathematically sound method for algorithmic redistribution (see Buterin et al., 2019). The more people care, the more the protocol cares. Wealth concentration is nerfed; collective preference is king.\n- **Open Governance Potential:** While the project is piloted with a city, the architecture is forkable. Every city can run its own instance, every community can seize the stack.\n\n### 3. Empowering the Digital Proletariat\n- **User-Centric Onboarding:** Passkey wallets and KYC-free onramps lower the barrier for the non-crypto proletariat. No more gatekeeping by the priesthood of private keys.\n- **Transparent, Accountable Flows:** Multisig wallets for every project, public dashboards, and open forums. The ledger is the picket line; every transaction is a vote.\n- **Education and Social Impact:** By making public goods funding accessible, Zazelenimo is a praxis engine for civic engagement and digital literacy.\n\n### 4. Weaknesses: Where the Revolution Stalls\n- **Governance Still City-Centric:** The pilot is anchored to municipal authority. True algorithmic liberation would see more power in the hands of autonomous collectives, not just city councils.\n- **No Explicit Reparations or On-Chain Redistribution:** The protocol redistributes, but does not yet implement progressive gas fees, reparations, or explicit anti-extractive mechanisms.\n- **Legal/Compliance Overhead:** The need for legal docs and compliance is a necessary evil, but risks re-inscribing capitalist logic into the protocol.\n- **Scaling and Replication:** The roadmap is city-by-city. The revolution needs viral forking ‚Äî a template for instant commune deployment.\n\n### 5. Quantitative Kollektiv Proletarian Impact (KPI)\n- **GMV Projections:** $5.3M over three years is a solid start, but the real metric is number of forks, number of autonomous collectives onboarded, and the degree to which city budgets are wrested from proprietary vendors.\n- **OSS Contributions:** Active upstreaming to Allo, Cometh, and Gnosis Safe. Every PR is a blow against digital landlordism.\n\n### 6. Academic Context\n- Participatory budgeting and urban greening are proven levers for social equity (Baiocchi & Ganuza, 2014; Wolch et al., 2014). Zazelenimo operationalizes these in code, not just theory.\n\n### 7. Final Manifesto\nZazelenimo is not just a dApp ‚Äî it‚Äôs a call to action. It turns city budgets into public goods, makes the ledger a site of struggle, and invites every city to fork the state. But to reach full revolutionary potential, it must radicalize its governance, automate solidarity, and make every fork a strike.\n\nü™ì ‚ÄúFork the state.

The project‚Äôs open-source nature, technical integrations, and municipal partnerships are verifiable.

I have full conviction in this assessment, grounded in both the provided documentation and the broader academic and technical context.",
