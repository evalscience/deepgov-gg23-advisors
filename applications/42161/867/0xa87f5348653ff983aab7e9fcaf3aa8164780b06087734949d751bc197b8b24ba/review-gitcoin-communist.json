  "summary": "Zazelenimo is an open-source web platform designed to modernize participatory budgeting with a focus on urban greening initiatives. The project leverages Ethereum and Quadratic Funding to empower communities, promote democratic funding, and enhance civic engagement. It aims to integrate with municipal systems, starting with a pilot in the City of Split, and plans to use grant funds for technical development, legal compliance, and marketing efforts.",
  "review": "The Zazelenimo project presents a compelling case for enhancing civic engagement through participatory budgeting focused on urban greening. The use of open-source technology and integration with Ethereum for secure transactions and identity management is commendable. The project's emphasis on democratic funding through Quadratic Funding aligns well with the principles of equitable distribution and community empowerment. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a clear sustainability model beyond initial funding. The focus on a single city pilot may limit geographic equity and broader impact. The project could benefit from a more structured approach to resource allocation and a clearer demonstration of long-term sustainability and scalability.",
