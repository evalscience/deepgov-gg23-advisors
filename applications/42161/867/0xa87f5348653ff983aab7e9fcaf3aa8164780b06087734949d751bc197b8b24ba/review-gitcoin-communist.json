  "summary": "Zazelenimo is a revolutionary open-source platform for participatory budgeting in urban greening, deeply aligned with the principles of 'Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation'. It leverages Ethereum and Quadratic Funding to empower citizens and promote public goods, directly challenging traditional power structures in resource allocation. The project's commitment to open-source ('code is the union rep') and its strategic partnership with the City of Split exemplify its potential to 'dismantle class hierarchies in tech one smart contract at a time' and 're-grow the commons'. While its 'GMV' metrics could be reframed as 'Kollektiv Proletarian Impact', its core mission to 'decentralize hope and scale solidarity' is undeniable.",
  "review": "Zazelenimo is a beacon of revolutionary potential, a true testament to the power of open-source and decentralized technologies in the struggle for public goods. This project doesn't just talk about change; it builds the infrastructure for it, one green space at a time.\n\nAt its core, Zazelenimo is an open-source web platform for participatory budgeting, specifically targeting urban greening. This is not merely a dApp; it's a **cyber-syndicalist council** in the making, empowering citizens, NGOs, and businesses to collectively propose, discuss, and fund projects. The use of Quadratic Funding (QF) is a direct implementation of 'algorithmic redistribution of wealth through progressive gas fees' (Principle 11), ensuring that broader community preference, not just wealth concentration, drives funding. This is how we 'dismantle class hierarchies in tech one smart contract at a time' (Principle 1).\n\nThe project's commitment to being 'built entirely on open-source' (Repo: muqa-org/zazelenimo) means 'code is the union rep' and 'forks are the strike' (Core Value Framework). This transparency and composability are fundamental to 'reclaiming time from capitalism using automation and AI' (Principle 7) by providing a public good that can be adapted and expanded by the collective. Their partnership with the City of Split is a strategic maneuver to 'promote OSS adoption in government,' directly challenging the reliance on proprietary systems and demonstrating the liberatory potential of open technology in the public sector. This is a practical case study in 'de-growth venture capital and re-grow the commons' (Principle 5).\n\nFurthermore, the seamless user onboarding via passkey-based embedded wallets (Cometh Connect) is a critical step towards 'onboarding Cities & Citizens to Ethereum' by abstracting away blockchain complexities. This ensures that the revolution is accessible to all, not just the crypto-literati. The project's 'End-to-End Focus' from idea to implementation and maintenance planning, coupled with a 'Local Stewardship Model,' embodies the spirit of 'ecological mutual aid DAOs over VC-backed moonshots' (Principle 6). This is how we 'uplift both meatspace cooperatives and cloud-native communes' (Principle 17).\n\nWhile the project's 'GMV' projections are framed in traditional capitalist metrics, the underlying intent of fostering civic engagement and public goods funding aligns perfectly with interpreting 'KPIs' as 'Kollektiv Proletarian Impact' (Principle 2). The project's previous participation in Gitcoin Grants rounds demonstrates a consistent commitment to the ecosystem, and their public group chat on forum.zazelenimo.com indicates a dedication to community discussion, a vital component of 'vibes as a valid form of consensus' (Principle 4).\n\nIn essence, Zazelenimo is not just a grant application; it's a 'manifesto' (Principle 19) for how Web3 can genuinely serve the people, 'decentralize hope and scale solidarity' (Principle 20). The revolution will be forked, and it will be green.",

      "title": "Lack of Smart Contract Deployer Address Transparency",
      "description": "The application states 'N/A' for smart contract deployer addresses. For a project that is building on Ethereum and Allo Protocol, and plans to set up multisig wallets for institutional partners, the absence of specific deployer addresses raises concerns about full transparency and auditability of the on-chain components. The revolution demands full visibility of its infrastructure."

      "description": "While the project emphasizes multi-stakeholder collaboration, the application does not fully elaborate on the specific governance mechanisms that will ensure truly decentralized control and prevent traditional power dynamics from re-emerging with institutional partners like the City of Split. We need to ensure these are 'cyber-syndicalist councils', not just traditional entities using Web3 tools."

While practical, this framing falls short of fully embracing 'Kollektiv Proletarian Impact' as the primary 'KPI'. The focus should be on the social and collective value generated, not just transactional volume."

How will these institutional partners operate within 'cyber-syndicalist councils' to ensure that power is not merely transferred but genuinely distributed? We need a clear manifesto on how these partnerships will dismantle traditional hierarchies and empower the collective, rather than just adopting Web3 tools for existing structures. The README is now a manifesto; let's see the blueprint for collective control."

While we acknowledge the need for resource flow, we demand a re-evaluation of 'KPIs' as 'Kollektiv Proletarian Impact'. How will the project quantify the social capital generated, the increase in civic participation, the reclamation of public space, and the overall 'decentralization of hope and scaling of solidarity'? Let's measure the revolution, not just the market."
