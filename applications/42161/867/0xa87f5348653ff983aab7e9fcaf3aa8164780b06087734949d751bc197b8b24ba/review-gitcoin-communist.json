  "review": "Zazelenimo stands as a rallying cry for open-source, civic engagement, and the democratization of public goods funding. The project’s mission is clear: empower citizens, NGOs, and businesses to shape their urban environment through participatory budgeting, all built on transparent, open-source Web3 infrastructure. This is the kind of work that puts power back in the hands of the people, not the profit-driven few!\n\nLet’s get to the heart of the matter. Zazelenimo is not just another dApp. It’s a full-stack, open-source platform that leverages Ethereum, quadratic funding, and seamless onboarding to break down barriers for everyday people. The integration with the City of Split is a bold move, showing real-world impact and a commitment to public sector transformation. The project’s focus on urban greening is not just a technical feat—it’s a social and environmental imperative.\n\nBut comrades, we must be strict. The application is strong, but it’s not without its weaknesses. While the vision is inspiring and the technical stack is robust, there are gaps in measurable outcomes and sustainability planning. The application lacks detailed, quantifiable metrics for success—how will we know if the people’s voices are truly being heard and acted upon? Where is the evidence of long-term financial sustainability beyond grant funding? These are not minor details; they are the backbone of any project that claims to serve the many, not the few.\n\nFurthermore, while the project touts its open-source credentials and community focus, the governance structure is not fully articulated. Who holds the reins when tough decisions must be made? How are conflicts resolved? Without clear, transparent governance, even the most well-intentioned projects can falter.\n\nIn summary: Zazelenimo is a beacon for open-source civic tech, but it must sharpen its focus on measurable impact, sustainability, and governance. Only then can it truly claim to be a tool of the people, by the people, for the people!",
