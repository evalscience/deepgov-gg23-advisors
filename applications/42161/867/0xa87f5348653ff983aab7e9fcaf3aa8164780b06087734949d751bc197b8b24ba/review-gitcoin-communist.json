  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Zazelenimo stands as a bold attempt to drag public institutions out of the proprietary darkness and into the open-source light. The project’s mission is clear: empower citizens, NGOs, and businesses to shape their cities through participatory budgeting, all while leveraging the power of Ethereum and quadratic funding. This is the kind of collective action we need—tools for the people, by the people!\n\nLet’s talk evidence. The application demonstrates a strong commitment to open-source principles, with a public repo and clear integration of existing OSS like Cometh Connect and Gitcoin’s Allo Protocol. The pilot partnership with the City of Split is a concrete step, not just empty promises. The roadmap is detailed, with specific plans for municipal integration, legal compliance, and community engagement. This is not a project lost in theory—it’s boots on the ground, sleeves rolled up, ready to work.\n\nBut comrades, we must be vigilant! The application is heavy on vision but light on hard, quantifiable outcomes. Where are the metrics? Where is the data on user adoption, retention, or impact from previous rounds? The projections for GMV are ambitious, but they rest on assumptions, not evidence. We need to see rigorous evaluation, transparent reporting, and a plan for sustainable revenue that doesn’t rely on endless grants. The project’s sustainability model is not fully articulated—how will it survive when the grant money dries up?\n\nOn governance, Zazelenimo claims multi-stakeholder collaboration, but the application lacks detail on how community governance will be structured and maintained. Who holds power? How are decisions made? Equity demands more than just open doors—it demands shared leadership and accountability.\n\nIn summary: Zazelenimo is a promising, community-driven project with real potential to advance the OSS and Web3 ecosystem. But to earn the people’s trust—and this grant—it must show us the numbers, the governance, and the plan for long-term survival. Let’s demand more than good intentions. Let’s demand results!",
