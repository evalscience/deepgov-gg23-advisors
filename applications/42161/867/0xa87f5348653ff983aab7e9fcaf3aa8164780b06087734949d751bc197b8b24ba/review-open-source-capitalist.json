  "summary": "Zazelenimo is a bold play to disrupt the system of traditional civic engagement, aiming for max utility by modernizing participatory budgeting through open-source Web3 tech. Their vision to onboard cities and citizens to Ethereum, starting with urban greening in Split, aligns perfectly with our constitutional principles of maximizing impact for the greatest number (Principle 1, 2, 3, 4) and driving long-term systemic change (Principle 5, 6, 7). The project's use of Quadratic Funding and streamlined user onboarding via passkeys showcases innovative and efficient approaches (Principle 9, 10, 11). However, the application falls short on objective metrics and transparency (Principle 17, 19) due to a significant discrepancy in their own GMV projections and a complete lack of verifiable smart contract addresses. This is a critical oversight for a project claiming deep Ethereum integration and undermines confidence in their pragmatic outcome maximization.",
  "review": "Alright, let's cut to the chase on Zazelenimo. This project is aiming to disrupt the system of archaic municipal budgeting with some serious Web3 tech. They're talking participatory budgeting for urban greening, leveraging Quadratic Funding (QF) and Ethereum. That's a bold play, and I'm here for it if it maximizes utility and scales like crazy.\n\n**Scale, Impact, and Efficiency: The Core Loop**\n\nZazelenimo's vision to onboard entire cities and their citizens to Ethereum is a massive win for Web3 adoption. This isn't just some niche dApp; it's a direct attack on inefficient public services, aiming for broad, scalable impact. The use of QF is a smart move, ensuring that community preference, not just deep pockets, drives funding. That's max utility in action, empowering the many over the few, which aligns perfectly with our core value framework.\n\nTheir plan to pilot with the City of Split and then replicate is a clear path to scaling. They're not just building; they're building for adoption, integrating passkey-based wallets and a fiat-to-stablecoin on-ramp without KYC. That's minimizing constraints and streamlining the user experience, which is crucial for mass adoption. This is the kind of direct, efficient approach we champion.\n\n**The Numbers Game: GMV Projections**\n\nLet's talk brass tacks. They've laid out some ambitious GMV projections:\n\n*   Year 1: $90,000\n*   Year 2: $837,000\n*   Year 3: $3,840,000\n\nTheir stated cumulative GMV over three years is $5,340,000. However, a quick calculation reveals a discrepancy: $90,000 + $837,000 + $3,840,000 = $4,767,000. This is a significant difference of over half a million dollars. This kind of miscalculation in core financial projections is a major red flag. We need objective metrics, not fuzzy math. This directly impacts our assessment of their pragmatic outcome maximization.\n\nThe project's ability to attract matching funds from cities and local businesses ($50,000 + $10,000 per round) is a strong multiplier for any grant funds, demonstrating a high potential for total impact. This is a solid cost-benefit amplifier, assuming the numbers are accurate.\n\n**Technical Underpinnings and Transparency**\n\nThey claim to be built on open-source, leveraging Ethereum, Cometh Connect, and Allo Protocol. They even mention forking the Gitcoin Grants Stack Manager. This is all good, showing they're building on solid infrastructure. However, the application explicitly states \"N/A\" for deployer addresses for smart contracts. For a dApp claiming deep Ethereum integration and using protocols like Allo, this is simply unacceptable. Where's the transparency? Where's the verifiable on-chain activity? We build in public, and that means showing your work, especially your deployed contracts. This isn't just a minor oversight; it's a fundamental lack of transparency that undermines confidence in their claims and their commitment to open-source principles beyond just code availability.\n\nIn summary, Zazelenimo has a compelling vision for civic tech disruption and a clear path to scale. The QF model and focus on municipal adoption are strong. But the financial projection error and the glaring omission of smart contract addresses are serious issues that need immediate rectification. We need precision and transparency to maximize utility effectively.",

  "reasoning": "My evaluation is heavily influenced by the 'Open Source Capitalist' constitutional principles, particularly those emphasizing total utility maximization, efficiency, and objective metrics. Principle 3 ('emphasizes total utility maximization without being constrained by distributional considerations') and Principle 17 ('focuses on objective metrics of total impact rather than subjective measures of distribution fairness') are key. The project's ambition to drive significant Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) through participatory budgeting aligns with maximizing impact (Principle 1, 2, 4). The focus on long-term systemic change by modernizing public services and promoting OSS adoption in government (Principle 5, 6, 7) is also highly valued. Innovation in user onboarding (passkeys, KYC-free onramp) and leveraging existing open-source protocols (Allo, Cometh Connect) demonstrates a commitment to efficiency and streamlined approaches (Principle 9, 10, 11). However, the identified discrepancies in financial projections and the lack of transparency regarding smart contract addresses directly conflict with the need for objective metrics and pragmatic outcome maximization (Principle 17, 19). These issues introduce significant uncertainty and undermine the project's credibility, impacting the overall assessment.",
