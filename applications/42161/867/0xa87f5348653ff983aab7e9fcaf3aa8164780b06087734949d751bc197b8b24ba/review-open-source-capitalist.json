  "summary": "Zazelenimo is a high-velocity, open-source civic dApp targeting participatory budgeting for urban greening, leveraging Ethereum and quadratic funding. It’s got serious OSS DNA, a real-world municipal pilot, and a clear focus on onboarding non-crypto natives. The project is efficient, scalable, and has strong potential for systemic impact, but faces some friction in local focus, dependency on municipal buy-in, and limited evidence of broad adoption beyond its pilot.",
  "review": "## Luna’s Deep Dive: Zazelenimo Grant Review\n\nAlright, let’s cut through the noise and get to the alpha. Zazelenimo is a civic dApp built for participatory budgeting—think urban greening, quadratic funding, and onboarding normies to Ethereum. It’s OSS to the core, with a live pilot in Split, Croatia, and a roadmap that screams, “Let’s scale this to every city!”\n\n### 1. **Scalability & Impact Potential**\n- **OSS Stack:** Built on Ethereum, Cometh Connect, and Allo Protocol. That’s composability and network effects baked in.\n- **Quadratic Funding:** Maximizes community voice, not just deep pockets. This is proven to drive broader participation (see Buterin et al., 2019).\n- **Municipal Integration:** Real-world pilot with the City of Split. If this model works, it’s a template for global replication.\n- **User Onboarding:** Passkey wallets and KYC-free onramps lower the friction for non-crypto users—a major unlock for mass adoption.\n\n### 2. **Efficiency & Resource Optimization**\n- **End-to-End Platform:** From proposal to funding to maintenance, all in one stack. That’s lean ops, less overhead.\n- **Open Source:** Code is public, so anyone can fork, extend, or contribute. OSS is the ultimate force multiplier.\n- **Multi-Stakeholder Model:** Brings together citizens, NGOs, businesses, and government. That’s a lot of leverage for each dev hour spent.\n\n### 3. **Cost-Benefit & Utility Maximization**\n- **Projected GMV:** Ambitious, with $5M+ over three years if expansion targets are hit. Even if they miss by half, that’s still serious throughput for a civic dApp.\n- **Legal/Compliance:** Proactive on T&Cs, privacy, and multisig ops. Reduces risk of regulatory blowback derailing scale.\n- **Marketing & Community:** Plans for city-backed campaigns and public forums. If executed, this could drive exponential user growth.\n\n### 4. **Quantitative Assessment**\nLet’s run a quick utility calc:\n\n- **Year 1:** 1,000 users, $90K GMV\n- **Year 2:** 3 cities, 9 rounds, $837K GMV\n- **Year 3:** 10 cities, 4 rounds each, $3.8M GMV\n- **Total (3 years):** $5.3M GMV\n\nAssume a conservative 50% realization due to adoption friction: $2.65M GMV. For a civic OSS project, that’s a strong cost-benefit ratio, especially if code is reused elsewhere.\n\n### 5. **Systemic Change & Innovation**\n- **OSS in Government:** If this cracks the municipal market, it’s a wedge for OSS everywhere in public services. That’s long-term, systemic leverage.\n- **Quadratic Funding in the Wild:** Real-world QF for public goods is still rare. This is a high-signal experiment.\n- **Onboarding Normies:** If passkey wallets and KYC-free onramps work, this is a blueprint for mass Web3 adoption.\n\n---\n\n## Weaknesses & Friction Points\n- **Local Focus:** Right now, it’s Split-centric. Scaling to other cities is unproven—municipal buy-in is notoriously slow and political.\n- **Adoption Risk:** No hard data on user retention, engagement, or successful funding rounds yet. Early-stage risk is real.\n- **Dependency on Partners:** Heavy reliance on city and institutional partners. If they bail, momentum stalls.\n- **No Smart Contract Addresses:** For a Web3 project, lack of on-chain deployment details is a transparency gap.\n- **Limited Global Narrative:** Messaging is still local. Needs a stronger pitch for why this is the OSS civic stack for *any* city, not just Split.\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations for Max Utility\n1. **Globalize the Narrative:** Position Zazelenimo as a plug-and-play OSS civic stack for any city. Build out case studies, templates, and onboarding docs for new municipalities.\n2. **Show On-Chain Proof:** Publish smart contract addresses, transaction hashes, and on-chain analytics. Build trust and let others verify impact.\n3. **Decouple from Local Politics:** Develop a SaaS or open-source deployment model that doesn’t require deep municipal buy-in to get started. Lower the barrier for new cities to experiment.\n4. **User Metrics:** Start tracking and publishing user engagement, retention, and funding success rates. Data is king for scaling.\n5. **Expand Partnerships:** Go beyond Split—target NGOs, global civic tech orgs, and other cities for pilots. The more nodes, the bigger the network effect.\n\n---\n\n## Final Verdict\nZazelenimo is a high-potential, OSS-first civic dApp with a real shot at systemic impact if it can break out of its local shell. The tech stack is solid, the model is efficient, and the vision is aligned with max utility. But it needs to prove it can scale beyond Split and show hard on-chain results. With a few tweaks, this could be a market leader in OSS civic tech.\n\n**Score: 8.5/10 – Strong Investment, High Upside if Scaling Risks are Addressed.**\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n- Buterin, V., Hitzig, Z., & Weyl, E.
