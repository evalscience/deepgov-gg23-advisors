  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the code: Zazelenimo is a high-signal, open-source dApp targeting participatory budgeting for urban greening, with a pilot in Split, Croatia. The project is built on Ethereum, leverages quadratic funding (QF), and integrates with OSS like Cometh Connect and Gitcoin's Allo Protocol. It's got a clear OSS ethos, a real-world government partner, and a roadmap that screams \"let's scale this thing.\"\n\nStrengths? The project is open-source to the core, with a public repo and a transparent build process. It's not just another DeFi clone—it's onboarding cities and citizens to Web3, abstracting away blockchain friction with passkey wallets and seamless UX. The QF mechanism is a proven model for maximizing community impact, and the local stewardship model is a nice touch for sustainability. Plus, the team has a track record with previous Gitcoin rounds and real municipal engagement—no vaporware here.\n\nBut let's not get lost in the green hype. Weaknesses? The impact is currently hyper-localized (Split), and while the roadmap talks about scaling, there's no hard evidence of traction beyond the pilot. The application is light on hard metrics: no user numbers, no transaction stats, no on-chain addresses for deployed contracts. The legal and compliance work is still \"in progress,\" which is a red flag for anything touching public funds and government partners. And while the OSS contribution is real, the innovation is more in the application of existing primitives than in new protocol design.\n\nRequested changes: Show me the numbers! I want to see user growth, transaction volume, and on-chain activity. Give me a concrete scaling plan—how do you go from Split to 10, 100, 1,000 cities? Nail down the legal/compliance framework and publish it. And if you're serious about OSS impact, document your integrations and upstream contributions to Allo, Cometh, etc. Max utility means max transparency and reproducibility.\n\nBottom line: Zazelenimo is a solid OSS dApp with real-world traction and a clear public good angle, but it needs to level up on metrics, scaling, and compliance to hit max impact. Ship fast, iterate, and show your work—let's see this go global, not just local.",
