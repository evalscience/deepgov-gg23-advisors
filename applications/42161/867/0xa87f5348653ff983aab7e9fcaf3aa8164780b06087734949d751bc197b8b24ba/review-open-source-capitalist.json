  "summary": "Zazelenimo is an open-source web platform designed to modernize participatory budgeting with a focus on urban greening initiatives. It leverages Ethereum and Quadratic Funding to empower communities, facilitate democratic funding, and enhance civic engagement. The project aims to integrate with municipal systems, starting with a pilot in the City of Split, and plans to use grant funds for technical development, legal compliance, and marketing efforts.",
  "review": "The Zazelenimo project presents a compelling case for enhancing civic engagement through open-source technology. It aligns well with the round's focus on accelerating open-source dApps and apps that offer novel utilities. The project's use of Ethereum and Quadratic Funding demonstrates innovation in application use cases, contributing to the Web3 ecosystem's growth. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the project's scalability and long-term impact beyond the initial pilot in Split. Additionally, while the project emphasizes community empowerment, it should also address how it plans to ensure equitable access and participation across different demographics.",
