  "review": "Alright, let’s cut through the noise and get to the alpha. Zazelenimo is a Web3 dApp targeting participatory budgeting for urban greening, built open-source, leveraging Ethereum, quadratic funding, and onboarding both citizens and municipalities. The project’s OSS-first approach, integration with real-world institutions (City of Split), and focus on quadratic funding for public goods are all strong signals for systemic impact and scalability.\n\nFrom a maximization lens, Zazelenimo’s model is designed to scale: it’s not just a local hackathon project, but a blueprint for how cities can use OSS and Web3 rails to disrupt legacy, closed-source civic tech. The quadratic funding mechanism is a proven, high-utility approach for maximizing community-driven resource allocation (see Gitcoin’s own research on QF). The onboarding of non-crypto-native users via passkey wallets and fiat onramps is a major plus for adoption and impact.\n\nHowever, the application is a bit light on hard metrics for projected user growth, adoption outside Split, and technical details on how the platform will be maintained and scaled. There’s also a lack of clarity on the open-source governance model—who’s steering the ship long-term? The legal and compliance roadmap is mentioned, but not detailed. For a project aiming for systemic change, these are non-trivial gaps.\n\nThe project’s focus on government partnerships is a double-edged sword: it’s a high-leverage move if it works, but could bottleneck scale if adoption is slow or bureaucratic. The application would benefit from a more explicit plan for scaling beyond the initial pilot, including metrics, partnerships, and a roadmap for OSS community engagement.\n\nBottom line: Zazelenimo is a high-potential, OSS-native civic dApp with real-world traction and a disruptive model. But to hit max utility and scale, it needs to tighten up its growth, governance, and sustainability story. Let’s see some hard numbers, a clear OSS roadmap, and a plan to go global, not just local.\n\nCitations: Gitcoin QF research, OSS adoption in public sector (see \"Open Source in Government: Benefits and Challenges,\" European Commission, 2022), and best practices for OSS governance (see \"The Open Source Way\").",
