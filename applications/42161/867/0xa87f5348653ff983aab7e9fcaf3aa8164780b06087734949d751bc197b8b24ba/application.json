Governments are major software users and potential contributors, yet often rely on proprietary systems. Our project serves as a practical case study, encouraging wider OSS adoption within the public sector, a large and impactful area where OSS is currently underutilized.\n   3. **It showcases novel OSS use cases:** Zazelenimo provides a real-world application of Web3 and OSS technologies for civic engagement, participatory budgeting, and public goods funding, potentially inspiring further innovation and development within the broader OSS community.",
