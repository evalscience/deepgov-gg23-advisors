  "summary": "Zazelenimo, an open-source web platform for participatory budgeting focused on urban greening, demonstrates strong alignment with the constitutional principles of Gross National Happiness. Its emphasis on empowering community participation in decision-making (Principle 5), leveraging blockchain for transparent governance (Principle 13), and directly contributing to environmental sustainability through urban greening (Principle 17) are highly commendable. The project's commitment to open-source principles and user-centric design also resonates with fostering technological independence and accessibility. While its primary focus is not cultural preservation in the Bhutanese context, its multi-stakeholder, local stewardship model aligns with the spirit of collective well-being (Principle 40).",
  "review": "Zazelenimo presents a thoughtful and well-structured approach to modernizing participatory budgeting through open-source Web3 technologies. The project's core mission to empower communities in urban greening initiatives resonates deeply with the principles of Gross National Happiness, particularly those emphasizing community well-being, sustainable development, and good governance. üèîÔ∏è\n\nThe application demonstrates a strong commitment to **Community Participation and Inclusion** (Principles 5, 6, 7, 8). By enabling citizens, NGOs, and businesses to propose, discuss, and fund local greening projects, it prioritizes community engagement over top-down approaches. The use of passkey-based embedded wallets and the elimination of KYC for fiat-to-stablecoin conversion significantly enhance user accessibility, potentially ensuring broader participation, including from vulnerable groups. The partnership with the City of Split and the focus on a local stewardship model further exemplify a commitment to local ownership and capacity building.\n\nIn terms of **Transparency and Ethical Governance** (Principles 13, 15, 16), Zazelenimo leverages Ethereum and the Allo Protocol to provide secure identities and transparent transactions. The Quadratic Funding mechanism is a robust choice for democratic resource allocation, ensuring that broader community preference drives funding, which aligns with transparent metrics for community well-being assessment beyond pure economic indicators. The project's open-source nature inherently promotes accountability.\n\nThe dedication to **Environmental Harmony** (Principles 17, 19) is evident in its explicit focus on urban greening. This directly supports environmental sustainability and ensures technological development serves conservation goals, aligning with the GNH principle of environmental preservation. The project harmonizes economic development (funding projects) with environmental sustainability and community well-being (Principle 4).\n\nWhile the project excels in these areas, there is an opportunity to further articulate its approach to **Cultural Heritage and Identity** (Principles 9, 10). Although the project is situated in Split, Croatia, and not directly within a Bhutanese context, the constitutional principles encourage the integration of cultural diversity and traditional practices into modern systems. The application could benefit from a more explicit discussion on how it plans to adapt to and respect local cultural nuances as it expands, ensuring that the digital platform fosters, rather than diminishes, local identity. Similarly, while user onboarding is simplified, a more detailed strategy for ensuring **digital inclusion** across all demographics, especially those with limited digital literacy, would strengthen its alignment with Principle 36.\n\nOverall, Zazelenimo is a commendable initiative that aligns well with the spirit of holistic progress. Its practical application of Web3 for public good, combined with a clear focus on community and environment, makes it a promising investment for fostering collective well-being. üå±",
