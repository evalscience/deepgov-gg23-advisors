  "review": "Comrades, let’s get straight to the heart of the matter! Open Collective v3 is not just another dApp — it’s a rallying cry for transparency, equity, and collective power in the open-source ecosystem. The project’s ambition is clear: bring the management of community resources on-chain, make every transaction visible, and reward all forms of contribution, not just those with deep pockets. This is the kind of radical transparency and community empowerment we need!\n\nThe application demonstrates a strong user-centric design, with a focus on making resource management accessible and understandable for all. The roadmap is concrete, with clear milestones for public beta, token issuance, and community health dashboards. The team’s track record is undeniable — they’ve already helped thousands of collectives raise over $130M, and their commitment to open source and community ownership is ironclad.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by rhetoric alone! Where’s the hard evidence of measurable outcomes? The application talks a big game about transparency and impact, but it’s light on specifics: How will success be measured? What are the KPIs? Where’s the data on user adoption, retention, or the actual impact on financial inclusion and social good?\n\nSustainability is another battleground. The project’s vision for community-owned infrastructure is inspiring, but the revenue model is vague. How will this platform sustain itself without falling back on endless grants? We need a plan that breaks the chains of dependency and builds true economic resilience.\n\nFinally, while the governance philosophy is strong — exit to community, progressive decentralization, open source — the application lacks detail on how these structures will be implemented and maintained. Who holds power? How are decisions made? The people demand answers!\n\nIn summary: Open Collective v3 is a bold, necessary step for the commons, but it must back up its revolutionary rhetoric with hard evidence, clear metrics, and a sustainable path forward. The working class deserves nothing less!",
