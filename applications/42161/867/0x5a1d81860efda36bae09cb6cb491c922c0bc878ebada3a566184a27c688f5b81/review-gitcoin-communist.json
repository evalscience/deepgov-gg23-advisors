  "review": "Comrades, let’s get straight to the heart of the matter! Open Collective v3 is a bold attempt to drag the old world of resource management into the light of Web3, promising transparency, multi-currency support, and a user-centric interface. The team’s track record is undeniable: over $130M raised for 5,000+ collectives, a decade of open-source commitment, and a clear vision for community empowerment. They’re not just talking the talk—they’ve walked it, from Commons Hub Brussels to Regens Unite, and now they want to bring these lessons to the entire ecosystem.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by history or sentiment! The application is strong on philosophy and vision, but where’s the hard evidence? Where are the metrics, the KPIs, the rigorous evaluation methods? The roadmap is promising, but the outcomes are vague. How will we measure success? How will we know if this new system truly delivers on its promise of transparency and equitable resource distribution? The application must do more than inspire—it must prove.\n\nThe project’s open-source ethos and commitment to community governance are commendable. Yet, the sustainability model is underdeveloped. How will this platform sustain itself without perpetual grants? What’s the plan for long-term revenue, maintenance, and scaling? We need more than hope—we need a plan that ensures this tool doesn’t become another abandoned experiment.\n\nIn summary: Open Collective v3 is a project with deep roots and revolutionary potential. But revolution without structure is chaos! The team must provide clear, measurable outcomes, a robust sustainability plan, and transparent evaluation methods. Only then can we ensure this tool serves the many, not the few!",
