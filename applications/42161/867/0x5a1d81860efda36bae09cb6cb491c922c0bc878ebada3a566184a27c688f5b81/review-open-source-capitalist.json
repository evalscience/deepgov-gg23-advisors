  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get to the core. Open Collective v3 is gunning for a massive upgrade: taking the OG open-source crowdfunding platform and plugging it straight into the Web3 mainframe. The mission? Radical transparency, multi-currency support, and rewarding all forms of contribution—not just cold, hard cash. This is a big swing at the root problem: public goods funding is opaque, and most tools are stuck in Web2 or single-currency silos. \n\nThe team’s got serious street cred—decade-long OSS impact, $130M+ raised, and a history of building for the commons. Their MVP is already live in the wild, patching together fiat, crypto, and community tokens for real-world collectives. The roadmap is ambitious but clear: public beta for transaction annotation, token issuance for non-financial rewards, and a dashboard for community health. All open source, all on-chain, all-in on transparency.\n\nFrom a maximization lens, this is high-leverage infrastructure. If it works, it scales: any collective, anywhere, can plug in and get transparent, multi-currency, on-chain admin. That’s a force multiplier for OSS, DAOs, and public goods. The innovation is real—no one else is bridging fiat, crypto, and social currencies at this scale, with this level of transparency. \n\nBut, let’s not get lost in the hype. The app’s differentiation is strong, but the technical details are a bit hand-wavy. There’s a lot of talk about custom code, but not enough about architecture, security, or how the pieces fit together for scale. Impact metrics are thin—number of transactions is a start, but where’s the data on user growth, retention, or real-world adoption? And while the team’s history is solid, the current Web3 branch is less than a year old—so there’s execution risk.\n\nBottom line: this is a high-potential, high-impact play. But to go full turbo, we need more technical meat and sharper KPIs. Show us the code, show us the numbers, and this thing could be a rocket ship for OSS and public goods transparency.",
