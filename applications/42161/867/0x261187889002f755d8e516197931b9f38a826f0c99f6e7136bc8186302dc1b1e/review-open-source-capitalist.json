  "review": "Alright, let’s cut through the noise and get to the code: Web3radio is gunning for a decentralized, community-driven radio stack—OSS all the way, with modular smart contracts, open-source infra, and a GitHub-first dev model. That’s a big plus for the open-source ecosystem, and the project’s hybrid approach (Livepeer, Swarm, IPFS, plus a centralized relay for normies) is pragmatic for onboarding Web2 users. The SBT-gated curation and on-chain scheduling are clever, and the roadmap for decentralized ad monetization and playlist optimization is ambitious and aligns with the round’s focus on novel dApp utility.\n\nBut let’s not sugarcoat the trade-offs: the frontend and some backend elements are still centralized, which is a big asterisk for a project waving the decentralization flag. The SBT burn mechanism for moderation—while DSA-compliant—raises red flags for censorship resistance and could limit scale if abused. Proxy relays for contract calls are a UX win but dilute the self-custody ethos. The project is transparent about these compromises, but they’re still friction points for max impact and long-term systemic change.\n\nOn the innovation front, the ad auction and playlist curation algorithms are solid differentiators, and the open-source, forkable stack is a multiplier for ecosystem growth. The project’s focus on onboarding non-technical users is a net positive for adoption, but the reliance on centralized infra and admin controls could bottleneck scale and resilience. For max utility, a clear roadmap to full decentralization is needed, plus more detail on how the project will drive adoption beyond the SBT-gated community.\n\nBottom line: Web3radio is a high-potential OSS dApp with real-world utility and a pragmatic approach to onboarding, but it needs to double down on decentralization and clarify its path to scale. Let’s see more code, less compromise, and a roadmap that nukes single points of failure. Build in public, disrupt the system, but don’t get stuck in Web2 quicksand.",
