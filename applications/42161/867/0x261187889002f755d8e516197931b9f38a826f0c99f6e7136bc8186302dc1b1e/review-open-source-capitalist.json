  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get to the code: Web3radio is a bold, open-source play to decentralize community radio, leveraging SBTs, on-chain scheduling, and hybrid storage. The project is forkable, modular, and OSS-first—major pluses for ecosystem expansion. The team is transparent about their pragmatic compromises (centralized frontend, backend relay, SBT revocation for moderation), which, while not maximalist, are honest attempts to onboard normies and iterate fast. \n\nOn the innovation front, the V2 roadmap (decentralized ad auctions, playlist curation algorithms) is spicy—if delivered, it could set a new standard for decentralized media monetization and governance. The use of proxy relays and hybrid storage is a practical bridge for Web2 users, but it does introduce centralization risks. The SBT burn mechanism for moderation is a double-edged sword: it keeps the platform healthy but could be abused or conflict with censorship-resistance ideals. \n\nFrom a maximization lens, this project has serious scale potential: any community can fork and launch their own radio, and the OSS stack could become a backbone for decentralized media. However, the current reliance on centralized components and admin controls is a bottleneck for true systemic change. The team’s transparency about these trade-offs is refreshing, but the path to full decentralization needs clearer milestones and timelines. \n\nBottom line: Web3radio is a high-potential, pragmatic OSS dApp that could drive mass adoption and ecosystem growth—if it can deliver on its decentralization promises and minimize admin choke points. The impact is broad, the innovation is real, but the centralization risks need to be actively mitigated for max utility. \n\nCitations: The project aligns with the round’s focus on OSS, user-centric design, and ecosystem growth. The open-source repo is public (https://github.com/spaghettETH/web3radio), and the roadmap addresses both technical and governance innovation. The team’s approach is consistent with the model’s prioritization of scalable, high-impact infrastructure, but falls short of full decentralization at present.",
