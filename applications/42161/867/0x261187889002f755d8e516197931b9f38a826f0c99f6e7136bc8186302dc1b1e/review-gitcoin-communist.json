Web3radio by SpaghettETH is a bold attempt to democratize media, putting the power of broadcasting into the hands of the people. The project is open-source, forkable, and designed to onboard non-technical users into the world of decentralized radio. That’s the kind of collective action we need! But let’s not be blinded by rhetoric—let’s measure, let’s scrutinize, let’s demand more!\n\nStrengths? Absolutely. The project is open-source to its core, with smart contracts, playlists, and even advertising mechanisms all available for public scrutiny and reuse. It’s not just talk—they’re integrating Livepeer, Swarm, and IPFS, showing real commitment to decentralization. The onboarding of Web2 users is a practical step toward mass adoption, and the community-driven curation and monetization models are a breath of fresh air in a world dominated by corporate algorithms.\n\nBut let’s not ignore the cracks in the foundation. The frontend is centralized, hosted on Digital Ocean. The backend, too, is a compromise for accessibility. These are not minor details—they are fundamental weaknesses that threaten the very spirit of decentralization. The SBT contract includes a burn mechanism for moderation, which, while legally prudent, raises serious questions about censorship and the concentration of power. Proxy relays for contract calls, while user-friendly, introduce trust assumptions that must be addressed.\n\nWhere’s the evidence of impact? Where are the user numbers, the growth metrics, the quantifiable outcomes? We need hard data, not just promises. The sustainability model is unclear—how will this project survive without perpetual grants? The roadmap is ambitious, but where’s the rigorous evaluation, the transparent reporting, the proof that this is more than just another experiment?\n\nIn summary: Web3radio is a promising, community-oriented project with real potential to serve the public good. But to earn the people’s trust—and the people’s resources—it must do more. Show us the numbers. Decentralize the stack. Prove your impact. Only then can we say, with conviction, that this is a project worthy of collective support!",
