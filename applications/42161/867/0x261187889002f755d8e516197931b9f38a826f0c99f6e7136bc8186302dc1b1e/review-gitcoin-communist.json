  "review": "Let’s get straight to the heart of the matter: Web3radio by SpaghettETH is a bold attempt to democratize media, but does it truly serve the people, or does it fall short of the revolutionary promise of open, equitable technology?\n\nFirst, the project’s commitment to open-source principles is clear. The code is public, modular, and forkable. Anyone can take it, build on it, and launch their own decentralized radio. That’s a win for the commons! The integration of Livepeer, Swarm, and IPFS shows a real effort to build on the backbone of decentralized infrastructure, not just pay lip service to Web3 ideals.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by technical jargon. The project admits to a centralized frontend and backend relay. Why? To onboard Web2 users and iterate quickly. That’s pragmatic, but it’s a compromise. The reliance on a centralized relay for contract calls and a backend for storage links means the system is not yet fully trustless or censorship-resistant. The SBT contract’s ability to burn tokens for community guideline violations is a double-edged sword: it can protect against abuse, but it also centralizes power and risks arbitrary exclusion. Is this the collective governance we demand, or a new gatekeeper in disguise?\n\nOn the evidence front, the application is strong on vision but weak on hard data. Where are the user numbers, growth metrics, or impact statistics? How many communities have launched their own radios? How many listeners have been onboarded from Web2? Without these, we’re left with promises, not proof. The roadmap for V2 features is ambitious—decentralized advertising, playlist optimization, and more—but again, where’s the evidence that these will deliver measurable, equitable outcomes?\n\nSustainability is another concern. There’s mention of ad slot monetization and community-driven pricing, but no clear revenue model or plan for long-term financial independence. Will this project stand on its own, or will it be back for more grants next year?\n\nIn terms of governance, the project is community-curated in theory, but the SBT burn mechanism and centralized relays suggest a top-down control that could undermine true collective ownership. Geographic equity and inclusion are not addressed—how will this serve the underserved, or is it just another playground for the already-connected?\n\nIn summary: Web3radio is a promising experiment, but it must do more to prove its impact, decentralize its control, and build a sustainable, equitable system. The revolution demands more than good intentions—it demands results!",
