          "answer": "X-Meme significantly contributes to the OSS ecosystem by providing a decentralized and transparent financial infrastructure tailored for social value quantification and memecoin markets, binding memecoins directly to decentralized IDs (ùïè IDs). X-Meme is fully open-source,  its contracts are publicly verified and accessible on GitHub, allowing developers and communities to freely audit, fork, or build upon the project.\n\nSpecifically, X-Meme contributes to the OSS ecosystem by:\n\n1. Open-Source Contract Infrastructure: All X-Meme smart contracts are fully open-source and accessible on GitHub, promoting transparency and trust. Developers can freely leverage this infrastructure to build new decentralized financial applications or enhance existing ones, fostering innovation and collaboration.\n\n2. Public API and Developer Tools: X-Meme offers a public subgraph via The Graph Protocol, providing developers easy access to indexed blockchain data for creating custom analytics tools, trading bots, or decentralized applications. This substantially lowers the entry barrier for developers aiming to participate in and expand the OSS ecosystem.\n\n3. Innovative Risk-Free Leverage Mechanism: X-Meme introduces a unique, contract-level risk-free multiply mechanism, enabling efficient capital utilization (up to 50√ó leverage) without liquidation risk. This novel mechanism can serve as a valuable reference model for other OSS DeFi projects, stimulating further research and innovation in decentralized financial engineering.\n\n4. Social Value Quantification: By linking memecoins directly with decentralized social identities (ùïè IDs), X-Meme opens up new possibilities for quantifying social influence and contributions, benefiting content creators, influencers, and open-source contributors by enabling sustainable and fair economic rewards.\n\nThrough these mechanisms, X-Meme not only expands the financial opportunities within the OSS community but also inspires innovation and supports the sustainable growth of the decentralized application ecosystem.",

One ùïè ID = One Memecoin: Each decentralized social ID (ùïè ID) generates a unique memecoin, directly linking a user's social identity to their economic value.\n\n2. Risk-Free Leverage: Allows users to access up to 50√ó leverage without liquidation risk through a novel, secure collateral mechanism, dramatically enhancing capital efficiency.\n\n3. Automatic Revenue Distribution: Implements a sustainable fee distribution model, with 1% of all transaction fees automatically distributed to ùïè ID holders, ensuring continuous passive income.\n\n4. Bonding Curve Pricing: Utilizes an innovative bonding curve pricing model, ensuring price discovery and liquidity without requiring external market makers.\n\nDifferentiation:\n\n1. Social ID Binding: Unlike typical memecoin platforms, X-Meme uniquely binds economic value to social identities, quantifying social influence directly into monetary value.\n\n2. No Presale or Team Allocation: Emphasizes fairness by having no token presale or dedicated team token allocation, avoiding centralized token distribution issues.\n\n3. Risk-Free Collateral: Unique risk-free collateral mechanism distinguishes X-Meme from traditional leverage-based platforms, eliminating liquidation risks inherent in other DeFi systems.\n\n4. Decentralized and Transparent: Fully open-source infrastructure ensures transparency, decentralization, and community trust, setting it apart from centralized or semi-centralized competitors.",

Scalability and Optimization: Improve the current infrastructure and contracts for higher scalability, lower gas fees, and better user experiences.\n\n3. Cross-chain Compatibility: Explore and develop cross-chain solutions, enabling X-Meme to interact seamlessly with multiple blockchain ecosystems.\n\n4. Community Growth and Education: Promote community growth through educational initiatives, marketing campaigns, and partnerships, ensuring broader adoption and community-driven development.\n\nGrant funds will specifically be utilized to achieve these goals by:\n\n1. Allocating resources towards developer relations and community education.\n\n2. Funding technical research and development for scalability enhancements and cross-chain integrations.\n\n3.

Are there trading restrictions?\n\nAnyone can fairly trade any ùïè Meme Coin on the platform.\n\n### 10. Explanation **Risk-free Multiply** mechanism.\n\nùïè-meme implements a contract-level risk-free multiply mechanism.\n\nBased on bonding curve token, ùïè-meme Coins can only be obtained through buy, which locks ETH into the contract in exchange for Coins. The ETH required for exchanging equivalent amounts of ùïè-meme Coins only increases according to the bonding curve.\n\nThe team, after years of continuous exploration, has innovatively proposed a risk-free collateral mechanism:\n\nHolders of ùïè-meme Coin can\n\n- Pledge the ùïè-meme Coin they hold\n- Lend out $ETH locked in the contract, while the pledged Coin remains locked in the contract.\n- When redeeming the Coin, the $ETH is then returned to the contract.\n\nDue to the unique issuance mechanism, the market price cannot fall below the borrowed price, even in extreme scenarios where all other holders sell.\n\n### 11. How to expand the capital utilization rate to 50√ó on ùïè-meme?\n\nUsers can leverage up to 50√ó during any Coin‚Äôs initial phase using minimum value through the risk-free multiply mechanism.\n\nSimply check the multiply option in the purchase interface. Example: Use 0.1 ETH to buy a position of 47,619 ùïè-meme Coins (0.4% collateral fee applies; without Multiply, 5 ETH would be required for the same Coins).\n\n![CleanShot 2025-01-05 at 14.54.03.png](https://public.degengate.fun/CleanShot_2025-01-05_at_14.54.03.png)\n\n### 12. How to understand Debt and Net Value on ùïè-meme?\n\nWhen using Multiply, users are essentially performing risk-free multiply mechanism via smart contracts.\n\nWith market price fluctuations, direct gains can be obtained. At this time, it is necessary to first return the $ETH borrowed from the contract, and then obtain the profit from market fluctuations.\n\nThe $ETH borrowed is considered Debt, and the final profit is the Net Value.\n\n![CleanShot 2025-01-05 at 22.20.12.png](https://public.degengate.fun/CleanShot_2025-01-05_at_22.20.12.png)\n\n### 13. What are the advantages of playing ùïè-meme compared to simple PvP?\n\nCompared to platforms like [pump.fun](http://pump.fun), ùïè-meme offers:\n\n- Scarcity. One ùïè ID = One ùïè Memecoin. Each ùïè ID has a unique Memecoin.\n- Quantify Social Value. ùïè-meme Coin represents the social value of ùïè ID, not limited to \"Meme\", while it opens a brand new investment and revenue channel for Holders and Followers.\n- ùïè ID Holders have sustainable income.

Are there trading restrictions?\n\nAnyone can fairly trade any ùïè Meme Coin on the platform.\n\n### 10. Explanation **Risk-free Multiply** mechanism.\n\nùïè-meme implements a contract-level risk-free multiply mechanism.\n\nBased on bonding curve token, ùïè-meme Coins can only be obtained through buy, which locks ETH into the contract in exchange for Coins. The ETH required for exchanging equivalent amounts of ùïè-meme Coins only increases according to the bonding curve.\n\nThe team, after years of continuous exploration, has innovatively proposed a risk-free collateral mechanism:\n\nHolders of ùïè-meme Coin can\n\n- Pledge the ùïè-meme Coin they hold\n- Lend out $ETH locked in the contract, while the pledged Coin remains locked in the contract.\n- When redeeming the Coin, the $ETH is then returned to the contract.\n\nDue to the unique issuance mechanism, the market price cannot fall below the borrowed price, even in extreme scenarios where all other holders sell.\n\n### 11. How to expand the capital utilization rate to 50√ó on ùïè-meme?\n\nUsers can leverage up to 50√ó during any Coin‚Äôs initial phase using minimum value through the risk-free multiply mechanism.\n\nSimply check the multiply option in the purchase interface. Example: Use 0.1 ETH to buy a position of 47,619 ùïè-meme Coins (0.4% collateral fee applies; without Multiply, 5 ETH would be required for the same Coins).\n\n![CleanShot 2025-01-05 at 14.54.03.png](https://public.degengate.fun/CleanShot_2025-01-05_at_14.54.03.png)\n\n### 12. How to understand Debt and Net Value on ùïè-meme?\n\nWhen using Multiply, users are essentially performing risk-free multiply mechanism via smart contracts.\n\nWith market price fluctuations, direct gains can be obtained. At this time, it is necessary to first return the $ETH borrowed from the contract, and then obtain the profit from market fluctuations.\n\nThe $ETH borrowed is considered Debt, and the final profit is the Net Value.\n\n![CleanShot 2025-01-05 at 22.20.12.png](https://public.degengate.fun/CleanShot_2025-01-05_at_22.20.12.png)\n\n### 13. What are the advantages of playing ùïè-meme compared to simple PvP?\n\nCompared to platforms like [pump.fun](http://pump.fun), ùïè-meme offers:\n\n- Scarcity. One ùïè ID = One ùïè Memecoin. Each ùïè ID has a unique Memecoin.\n- Quantify Social Value. ùïè-meme Coin represents the social value of ùïè ID, not limited to \"Meme\", while it opens a brand new investment and revenue channel for Holders and Followers.\n- ùïè ID Holders have sustainable income. Influencers KOL, media, or open-source projects can all gain continuous income through ùïè-meme. [7.
