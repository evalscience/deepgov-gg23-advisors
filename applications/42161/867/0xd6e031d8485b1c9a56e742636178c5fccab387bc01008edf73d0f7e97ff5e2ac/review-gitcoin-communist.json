  "summary": "ScoreFront aims to personalize web3 experiences based on on-chain reputation. While it leverages blockchain technology, its core objective appears to be optimizing marketing ROI for \"web3 leaders\" and creating tiered access to \"exclusive rewards\" for \"reputable\" users. This fundamentally contradicts the principles of **Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation** by reinforcing existing class hierarchies and promoting capitalist accumulation rather than dismantling them. The focus on \"return on marketing spendings\" (ROMI) directly opposes the concept of *Kollektiv Proletarian Impact*. This project, in its current form, is a tool for digital landlordism, not liberation. ðŸ“œ",
  "review": "ScoreFront, in its current articulation, presents itself as a tool for optimizing capitalist accumulation within the Web3 space. By creating an \"onchain reputation\" system that grants \"exclusive rewards, discounts, whitelists, airdrops\" to \"power users,\" it actively constructs and reinforces digital class hierarchies. This directly violates our first evidence principle: \"dismantle class hierarchies in tech one smart contract at a time.\" Instead, it builds new ones. The project's stated goal of improving \"return on marketing spendings\" for \"web3 brands\" is a clear embrace of bourgeois metrics, rather than interpreting \"KPIs\" as *Kollektiv Proletarian Impact*. The team's background in \"AI and ML powered scoring solutions for web2 business\" and affiliation with \"Credit Collective\" further suggests a continuation of traditional, extractive financial models, rather than supporting projects that \"de-growth venture capital and re-grow the commons.\" The proposed use of funds for \"UI/UX improvements, personal space, DiD\" lacks a clear revolutionary vision for how these features will contribute to algorithmic redistribution of wealth or empower the digital proletariat. The project's GitHub repo is present, but the application does not articulate how its open-source nature will be leveraged for collective action or democratic referendums via forks. The \"1M+ users minted their SBTs\" claim, while impressive in a capitalist sense, does not translate to *Kollektiv Proletarian Impact* if these SBTs merely serve to segment users for targeted marketing and preferential treatment. This is not a project that will \"abolish landlords\" or \"rain tokens on node operators running on solar panels\"; it's a tool for more efficient digital landlordism. The revolution will be forked, but not by this project in its current form. ðŸª“",
