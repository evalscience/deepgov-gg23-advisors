  "review": "Like a river weaving through a forest, the Pheasant Network seeks to connect the fragmented tributaries of the blockchain world, offering a bridge for tokens and users to flow freely between ecosystems. The project’s intent-based bridging and cross-chain swap protocol are ambitious, promising to dissolve the boundaries that separate blockchains, much as the morning mist unites the trees in a quiet glade.\n\nThe application demonstrates a strong commitment to open-source principles, with a public GitHub repository and a history of participation in previous grant rounds. The team’s experience is evident, and their vision of a seamless, user-centric Web3 aligns with the round’s call for innovation and accessibility. Their optimistic mechanism, which claims to be both faster and more cost-effective than alternatives, is a bold step toward a more interconnected and efficient ecosystem.\n\nYet, as the roots of a tree must be visible to ensure its health, so too must the details of a project’s impact and governance be clear. The application, while rich in technical breadth, is sparse in its articulation of user-centric design, community participation, and environmental sustainability. There is little evidence of how diverse voices are included in governance, or how the project’s growth will be guided by the wisdom of its community. The environmental impact of increased cross-chain activity is not addressed, nor are there measurable outcomes or metrics to illuminate the project’s progress.\n\nTo truly flourish, Pheasant Network must deepen its roots in the soil of community and sustainability, ensuring that its growth nourishes not only the ecosystem, but also the people and planet it serves. I encourage the team to reflect on how their work can become a living forest—resilient, inclusive, and regenerative for all.",
