  "summary": "Library Protocol is an open-source book-sharing application that aims to bring physical libraries on-chain, allowing users to lend and borrow books globally. The project seeks to overcome geographical, financial, and trust barriers in traditional book lending by using blockchain technology. It envisions a decentralized network where books are represented as NFTs, and lending is managed through smart contracts, enhancing accessibility and fostering a global knowledge-sharing ecosystem.",
  "review": "The Library Protocol project presents a compelling vision of decentralizing access to books and knowledge through blockchain technology. It aligns well with the round's focus on enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability, contributing to education and social impact. The application demonstrates user-centric design by proposing features like on-chain libraries, secure lending, and a reputation system, which are innovative and cater to a global audience. However, the application lacks detailed information on the technical implementation and sustainability of the proposed features. Additionally, while the project outlines ambitious goals, it does not provide a clear roadmap or metrics for measuring success. The use of grant funds is broadly described, but more specificity is needed to understand how these funds will directly impact the project's development and community outreach efforts.",
