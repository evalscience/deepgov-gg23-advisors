          "description": "# Web3Stash\nWeb3Stash is a standard library to get a single api to connect to multiple decentralised storage service providers. If you are looking to connect to blockchain services like ipfs, pinata, nft.storage, arweave, bundlr, helia etc but don't want to read there docs and set them up individually, You can use this package to connect to any of these services. The best part is all the configuration settings and upload functions are almost same across all the services.\n\n# How this library works and Ease Your Development\n\n## Install the library\nThe official web3stash Node.js package. This is the easiest way to start developing with multiple decentralised storage service providers. \n\n```js\nInstall via NPM\nnpm install --save web3stash\n```\n\n## Importing and Using Package\nTake a look at how you might import and use the web3Stash package:\n\n```js\n// require the webStash module\nconst {Web3Stash} = require('web3stash');\n//or\nimport {Web3Stash} from 'web3stash';\n// provide service name, config properties like privateKeys\nconst service = Web3Stash(<serviceName>, <config>, <configOptions>)\n// Call the methods(Same for all services)\nservice.uploadJson(<jsonData>, <options>).then().catch()\nservice.uploadImage(<path to image>, <options>).then().catch()\nservice.uploadVideo(<path to video file>, <options>).then().catch()\nservice.uploadFile(<path to file>, <options>).then().catch()\n\n```\n\n### Start using services\nHead to services tab in [docs](https://theblockchainchief.gitbook.io/web3stash/) page and pass config details based on the service you want to use. All services need same three things when initialising web3Stash as shown above:\n\n```js\nWeb3Stash(<serviceName>, <config>, <configOptions>)\n```\n\n- serviceName(string) -  Here you have to put service you want to use like \"PINATA\", \"ARWEAVE\", \"BUNDLR\", etc in string format \n\n\nWe have made this project opensource and planning to integrate more and more services and also add data streaming and chunk uploading for big files for all the services we support making data uploading to decentralized storage networks easy, efficient, fast, and scalable. \n\nWe have been winner/Finalist at EthGlobal HackFS 2023.",

          "description": "This project outlines the creation of a decentralized library for web3 books and resources, which leverages blockchain technology and decentralized storage to provide a censorship-resistant, accessible, and verifiable platform for users to access and share educational and informational content.",
          "problem": "The need to implement more Web2 solutions into Web3 has necessitated this idea. Decentralized library is a no-censorship library where users go to read books and watch video books using the Web3 wallet. This books could be paid or tipped.",
          "solution": "The following benefit awaits users of this project\n\nHundreds of Academic E-Books: The Library has more books than you could imagine. E-books repositories are decentralized (IPFS Storage).\nLot of Video-Books: The full video books are here for you. if you cannot read the ebook format, you can read your favorite textbooks by watching them (IPFS Storage).\nNo Political Censorship: No fear from the government of your country not allowing certain books. You can read or watch them here.\nLearn and Earn: The very First decentralized Library where you LEARN and EARN.\nLive Class Streaming: Lecturers / Teachers can use this platform to schedule live teaching and learning. just contact us\nNo Loss of Books: Prevent the accidental or intentional loss of information from human consciousness\n\nDecentralized library, focused on sustainability and environmentally conscious content, can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) in several ways:\n\nReduction of Physical Resources: Traditional libraries often require large amounts of paper, ink, and other physical resources to produce and distribute printed books and materials. By promoting digital resources and e-books, a decentralized library can significantly reduce the demand for these resources, resulting in fewer emissions associated with their production and transportation.\nEnergy Efficiency: Centralized data centers and physical libraries require substantial energy for heating, cooling, and maintaining the infrastructure. Decentralized libraries, powered by blockchain technology and distributed storage systems, can potentially operate with lower energy consumption, especially if the network uses renewable energy sources.\nMinimized Transportation: Traditional library systems involve the distribution of physical books to various locations. This transportation contributes to GHG emissions due to the use of fossil fuels in the delivery process. A decentralized library eliminates the need for physical transportation, reducing emissions associated with the shipping of books and resources.\nReduced Deforestation: Decentralized libraries can discourage deforestation by advocating for the use of digital content rather than paper-based resources. Reduced demand for paper products can help protect forests and reduce the carbon emissions associated with deforestation.\nRemote Access: By providing users with easy access to digital resources from anywhere in the world, a decentralized library can reduce the need for individuals to travel to physical libraries. Fewer trips to library locations mean fewer emissions from transportation.\nEnvironmental Education: Decentralized libraries can curate content on environmental sustainability, climate change, and green technologies. By providing access to these resources, they can help educate the public about climate issues and inspire action to reduce GHG emissions.\nBlockchain for Carbon Offsetting: Some blockchain projects and cryptocurrencies are exploring ways to support carbon offsetting initiatives. A decentralized library could potentially integrate with such initiatives to facilitate carbon offset donations or rewards for users engaged in sustainable practices.\nSupport for Green Initiatives: A decentralized library can serve as a platform for sharing information about local and global green initiatives and sustainability projects. It can connect users with resources on renewable energy, eco-friendly practices, and climate change mitigation efforts.\nPeer-to-Peer Sharing: Decentralized libraries can encourage users to share resources with their peers, reducing the need to purchase new books or access new digital content. Sharing and peer-to-peer exchange can help minimize resource consumption and reduce the carbon footprint of producing new materials.\nData Security and Privacy: Ensuring data security and privacy can reduce the likelihood of data breaches or cyberattacks that could result in energy-intensive data recovery and restoration processes, thus minimizing associated GHG emissions.\nIn summary, a decentralized library that emphasizes sustainability and digital resources can help reduce GHG emissions by minimizing the demand for physical resources, decreasing energy consumption, reducing transportation-related emissions, and fostering environmental education and awareness. Such a library can play a valuable role in supporting global efforts to combat climate change and promote a more sustainable future.\n\n",

          "description": "## Overview\n\nLibrary Protocol is an open-source book-sharing application that enables users to bring their physical libraries on-chain, lend books, and borrow books in a borderless way. It serves as a network connecting book and library owners with book lovers, readers, and curious minds.\n\nFor centuries, books have been the cornerstone of knowledge and intellectual progress. Libraries have preserved history, empowered thinkers, and shaped civilizations. But access to books remains limited by geography, availability, and ownership.\n\n### *What if anyone, anywhere, could borrow books seamlessly—without borders?*\n\nWith Library Protocol, you can:\n📚 Put your personal or institutional library onchain\n🔗 Lend books securely using smart contracts\n📖 Borrow books from anywhere without relying on centralized platforms\n🛡 Leverage a reputation-based system for responsible borrowing\n\n*The goal? To unlock knowledge for everyone, everywhere!*\n\n[![1500x500.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/Xq6LpcTS/1500x500.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/Vr4nhMfD) \n\n**Why Do We Need Onchain Libraries?**\nIn today’s world, access to books is restricted by several barriers:\n❌ Physical limitations – Libraries and personal collections are confined by geography.\n❌ High costs – Many valuable books remain unaffordable for students, researchers, and knowledge seekers.\n❌ Trust issues – Traditional lending requires manual agreements with no enforcement mechanism.\n❌ Lack of incentives – Book owners have little reason to share their collections openly.\n\nLibrary Protocol solves these issues by introducing a decentralized, global book-sharing network where ownership, lending, and borrowing are managed transparently on-chain.\n\n[![Screenshot-2025-03-08-010256.png](https://i.postimg.cc/3J3ng1bn/Screenshot-2025-03-08-010256.png)](https://postimg.cc/BtwT3T3K) \n\n**How Library Protocol Works**\nLibrary Protocol is designed to be open, transparent, and accessible. Here's how it works:\n📖 1. **Create Your Onchain Library**\n- Connect your wallet and create your own onchain library.\n- Register books you own (metadata like Title, Author, ISBN, Cover Image stored on IPFS).\n- Each book is represented as an NFT for tracking purposes.\n\n📚 2. **Lend Books Securely**\n- List books from your library for lending.\n- Set lending conditions (with or without collateral).\n- Borrowers request books, and a smart contract handles agreements and collateral.\n\n🔗 3. **Borrow Books from the Network**\n- Browse available books across different libraries.\n- Request to borrow, deposit collateral if required.\n- Return books on time to maintain a strong reputation score.\n\n🛡 4. **Trust & Reputation System** \n- Every borrower and lender has an onchain reputation score.\n- Timely returns improve reputation, unlocking better lending terms.\n\n[![Screenshot-2025-03-08-014352.png](https://i.postimg.cc/qqB0Vnj0/Screenshot-2025-03-08-014352.png)](https://postimg.cc/tZc8FsKm) \n\n### Built for Readers, Libraries, and the Future of Knowledge\nLibrary Protocol is built for:\n📖 **Readers & Learners** – Anyone seeking knowledge, from casual readers to researchers.\n📚 **Book Enthusiasts** – Those who own physical books and want to share them.\n🏛 **Libraries & Archives** – Institutions aiming to digitize collections and reach a global audience in novel ways.\n👥 **Communities & Educators** – Groups looking to build decentralized knowledge-sharing hubs.\nBy bridging the physical and digital book world, Library Protocol creates a borderless knowledge ecosystem.\n\nThe future of libraries is on-chain. Library Protocol transforms your personal bookshelf into a gateway of global wisdom—a decentralized network that unites curious minds and delivers books to communities, you or anyone, anywhere!\n",

              "explanation": "The ultimate goal of Library Protocol is to be a catalyst for global literacy and connection. Our vision is a world where every story finds its reader, and every reader finds their story. Here are some use cases of the platform and those that we envision. \n\n\n### A Book-sharing App\n\nImagine: Maria, a single mother in rural Mexico, who loves reading but has no local library. Using Library Protocol’s book-sharing app, she borrows a children’s book from a lender in Texas to read to her son, sparking his love for stories. The app’s intuitive interface makes it easy for her to request and return the book, bringing literature into her home for the first time.\n\n### A Knowledge Sharing Network\n\nImagine: A group of university students in Nigeria forms a study circle on Library Protocol, sharing academic books with peers in South Africa and India. Through the knowledge-sharing network, they exchange notes and insights on sustainable agriculture, collaboratively writing a research paper that wins a regional award, all enabled by the platform’s global reach.\n\n### A Vehicle for Getting Books to Places\n\nImagine: A refugee camp in Jordan lacks educational resources. Through Library Protocol, a volunteer in Germany sends 50 textbooks to the camp, using the platform to coordinate shipping and track delivery. The books arrive, providing children with their first access to science and math education, proving the platform’s power as a vehicle for getting books to places in need.\n\n### Sharing Knowledge, Connecting Curious Minds\n\nImagine: An aspiring writer in the Philippines connects with a retired professor in Canada on Library Protocol. The professor lends a rare book on creative writing, and they engage in a discussion via the platform’s messaging feature. This exchange of knowledge inspires the writer to publish her first novel, showing how Library Protocol connects curious minds across borders.\n\n### Your Bookshelf, Shared with the World!\n\nImagine: Kutubu, a book collector in Ghana, has a shelf of 200 books on African history. He lists them on Library Protocol, and within a month, his books are borrowed by readers in Brazil, Japan, and France. Kutubu’s collection—his bookshelf, shared with the world—helps global readers learn about his culture, fostering cross-cultural understanding.\n\n### Read More, Access More\n\nImagine: Priya, a high school student in India, dreams of studying astronomy but can’t afford textbooks. On Library Protocol, she borrows a series of astronomy books from lenders in Australia and the UK, accessing resources she’d never find locally. This enables her to read more, access more, and eventually win a scholarship to a prestigious university.\n\n### Decentralizing Access to Every Story\n\nImagine: A group of communities band together and pull funds together, purchasing 1000 copies of Vitalic's or Owocki's new book and shipping it to these communities based in various countries in Africa. \n\n### Library Protocol Turns Any Book Owner into a Library\n\nImagine: Sarah, a retiree in Scotland with a modest collection of 50 books, joins Library Protocol. She lists her books, and soon, readers from New Zealand to Nigeria are borrowing her novels and gardening guides. Sarah, once just a book owner, becomes a library, serving a global community and feeling a renewed sense of purpose in her retirement.\n\n### Library Protocol is Redefining the Future of Libraries\n\nImagine: A small town in Brazil, unable to fund a public library, adopts Library Protocol as its library system. Residents share their personal collections, creating a decentralized library network that serves the entire community. This model—where libraries are no longer buildings but networks of people—shows how Library Protocol is redefining the future of libraries, making them more inclusive and resilient.\n\n### A Decentralized Economy for Open Knowledge\n\nImagine: Jamal, a book owner in Morocco, lends his collection of 100 books on Library Protocol, earning tokens for each loan. He uses these tokens to fund a literacy program in his village, while borrowers contribute reviews that earn them tokens to access more books. This decentralized economy for open knowledge ensures that sharing books benefits everyone, creating a sustainable cycle of learning and giving back."

              "query": "What are your plans for further development, and how will the grant funds be used to achieve these goals?",
              "explanation": "Library Protocol is poised to grow from humble beginnings into a global movement that redefines the future of libraries and builds a decentralized economy for open knowledge. \n\nWe are actively developing the next version of the dApp, which comes with lots of new features and innovations such as:\n\n- Enhanced onchain borrowing & Lending of Books\n- Enhanced version of Library Dashboard that provides more data and analytics of a libraries activities. \n- Enhanced version of reader profile including analytics of reading and borrowing activities\n- Reputation System \n- Community features\n- AI features\n- And a lot more. \n\n### Use of Grant Funds\nDevelopment: Enhance the app’s usability, add more innovative and user-centric features.   \n\nCommunity Outreach: Fund partnerships and marketing to grow our user base and increase our reach.  \n\nOperations and Security: Support blockchain upgrades, security audits, and operational costs to ensure reliability.\n\n\n\n"
