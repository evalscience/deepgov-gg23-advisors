  "review": "Brothers and sisters, let’s get straight to the heart of the matter! Library Protocol stands as a bold vision for global literacy, smashing the chains of geographic and economic exclusion. The project’s open-source, on-chain book-sharing platform is a rallying cry for knowledge as a public good, not a privilege for the few. The application is rich in narrative, painting vivid pictures of how the protocol could transform lives from rural Mexico to refugee camps in Jordan. The use cases are inspiring, and the commitment to open-source principles is clear. \n\nBut comrades, inspiration alone does not build the future! The application falls short where it matters most: evidence, measurement, and sustainability. There is a glaring lack of hard data—no user numbers, no metrics, no pilot results. Where are the measurable outcomes? Where is the proof that this protocol can scale, that it can deliver on its promise? The plans for further development are ambitious, but they are not backed by a structured roadmap, milestones, or a sustainable revenue model. The project’s impact on the Web3 ecosystem is described in broad strokes, but without quantifiable results, how can we ensure resources are allocated efficiently and equitably?\n\nThe application’s commitment to equity and global reach is commendable, and the vision aligns with the core values of collective benefit and public good. Yet, without transparent reporting, rigorous evaluation, and a clear plan for long-term sustainability, we risk building castles in the air. The people deserve more than dreams—they deserve results!",
