  "review": "Let’s get straight to the heart of the matter: Library Protocol is a bold vision for the people, by the people. It aims to tear down the walls that keep knowledge locked away, using open-source, decentralized tech to put books in the hands of those who need them most. The application is rich in narrative, painting a world where a single mother in Mexico, a student in Nigeria, or a retiree in Scotland can all access and share knowledge without borders. This is the kind of radical, collective action our world needs!\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by sentiment alone. The project’s open-source codebase is public and verifiable, and the use cases are clear: on-chain book registration, lending, borrowing, and a reputation system. The application demonstrates a strong commitment to user-centric design, with features like intuitive interfaces, community features, and analytics dashboards. The vision is global, with a focus on underserved communities and cross-cultural exchange. This is a direct hit on the round’s goals: accelerating open-source dApps that drive social impact, financial inclusion, and education.\n\nYet, comrades, we must demand more than dreams. Where is the hard evidence of impact? Where are the metrics, the data, the proof that this protocol is more than a beautiful idea? The application is heavy on vision and light on measurable outcomes. There’s no clear reporting on user adoption, transaction volume, or community governance structures. The sustainability plan is vague—how will this protocol survive without endless grants? How will it ensure equitable access, not just for the tech-savvy but for the truly marginalized?\n\nThe project’s governance and community engagement are mentioned, but not detailed. How will decisions be made? How will the protocol avoid the pitfalls of centralization or capture by a privileged few? And while the open-source ethos is strong, there’s little discussion of how the project will ensure long-term maintenance, security, and responsible resource allocation.\n\nIn summary: Library Protocol is a powerful, inspiring project with the potential to transform access to knowledge. But inspiration alone is not enough. We demand evidence, structure, and a plan for sustainability. The people deserve nothing less!",
