  "review": "Comrades, let’s get straight to the heart of the matter! Web3Privacy Now stands as a bulwark against the rising tide of digital surveillance, fighting for the right to privacy as a public good. Their mission is clear: empower the people, not the profit-driven few! They’ve built a massive open-source privacy database, organized global events, and launched educational resources—all free, all accessible. That’s the kind of collective action we need!\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by sentiment. The application shines in its commitment to open-source, user-centric design, and community education. The Privacy Explorer and Builder Pack are practical tools, not just empty promises. The Privacy Academy is already onboarding learners, and their events have real, measurable reach—over 5,000 attendees in 2024 alone. That’s evidence, not hype!\n\nYet, comrades, we must demand more! Where are the hard numbers on impact? How many developers have integrated privacy tools as a result? What’s the retention rate in the Academy? The application lacks rigorous, transparent reporting on outcomes. There’s no clear sustainability plan—how will this movement survive without perpetual grants? And while the vision is global, there’s little detail on how underserved or marginalized communities are being prioritized.\n\nWe must hold every project to the highest standard. The people deserve nothing less!",
