  "summary": "The Toban project aims to enhance the open-source software (OSS) ecosystem by providing a tool for role-based contribution tracking and reward distribution. It seeks to address the challenges of sustaining long-term contributions in OSS by rewarding contributors based on their involvement duration and contribution levels. The project is inspired by the Protocol Guild model and aims to empower OSS activity throughout Asia. Toban's unique approach includes using role NFTs and peer-to-peer tokens to track contributions and automate reward distribution using the Splits Protocol. The project plans to use the grant funds to refine its MVP, conduct smart contract audits, and explore use cases through pilot programs.",
  "review": "The Toban project presents a compelling case for enhancing the OSS ecosystem by addressing the challenge of sustaining long-term contributions. The use of role-based contribution tracking and reward distribution is innovative and aligns with the round's focus on novel utilities and services. The project demonstrates a clear understanding of the challenges faced by OSS maintainers and offers a solution that could significantly impact the sustainability of OSS projects. The integration with existing DAO tools and protocols further strengthens its potential for widespread adoption. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on how it plans to engage with the community and ensure environmental sustainability, which are key aspects of the model specification.",
