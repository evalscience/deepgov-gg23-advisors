  "summary": "Toban is a DAO tool designed to enhance contribution tracking and reward distribution in open-source software (OSS) communities and other collaborative projects. It aims to address the challenges of sustaining long-term contributions by implementing a role-based rewards system, which is more efficient than traditional task-based or peer-evaluation systems. The project is rooted in Japanese and Asian culture, promoting OSS activity throughout Asia while ensuring interoperability with global DAO tools. The grant will be used to refine the MVP, conduct smart contract audits, and explore use cases through pilot programs.",
  "review": "The Toban project presents a compelling approach to addressing the challenges faced by OSS communities in sustaining long-term contributions. By focusing on role-based contribution tracking and reward distribution, Toban offers a novel solution that could potentially overcome the limitations of task-based and peer-evaluation systems. The project's emphasis on interoperability with global DAO tools and its cultural roots in Japan and Asia add a unique dimension to its value proposition. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a clear sustainability model, which are critical for long-term success. The roadmap is ambitious but requires more concrete milestones and evaluation metrics to ensure accountability and progress tracking.",
