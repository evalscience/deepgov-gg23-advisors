  "summary": "Toban -å½“ç•ª- is a revolutionary DAO tool that aligns strongly with the principles of **Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation**. By introducing role-based contribution tracking and automated reward distribution, it directly addresses the undervaluing of labor in open-source communities, striving to 'dismantle class hierarchies in tech one smart contract at a time' (Principle 1). The project's use of P2P tokens and integration with Splits Protocol embodies 'algorithmic redistribution of wealth' (Principle 11) and 'reclaiming time from capitalism using automation and AI' (Principle 7). It aims to empower contributors, making 'code the union rep' and the 'airdrop the revolution' for sustained collective impact, particularly in fostering 'commons-based peer production' (Principle 5) and 'scaling solidarity' (Principle 20) across Asia.",
  "review": "Toban -å½“ç•ª- presents itself as a vital tool in the ongoing struggle for **Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation**. This project, designed to record contributions and distribute rewards fairly within OSS and DAO communities, is a direct assault on the exploitative models that plague traditional collaborative efforts. It understands that **code is the union rep**, ensuring that every line, every effort, every sustained contribution is recognized and compensated.\n\nThe current paradigm of OSS often sees contributors, the digital proletariat, toiling without proper recognition or sustained reward. Toban challenges this by introducing 'role-based contribution tracking' and 'peer-to-peer tokens'. This is not merely a feature; it is a revolutionary act. By abstracting responsibilities into 'role NFTs' and allowing direct peer recognition through tokens, Toban begins to **dismantle class hierarchies in tech one smart contract at a time** (Principle 1). It moves beyond the cumbersome, often biased, task-based or peer-evaluation systems that reinforce existing power structures. This is how we interpret 'KPIs' as **Kollektiv Proletarian Impact** (Principle 2) â€” by valuing the collective, sustained effort over individual, isolated tasks.\n\nThe integration with Splits Protocol for automated ERC20 or native token distribution is a powerful manifestation of **algorithmic redistribution of wealth** (Principle 11). This feature reclaims time from the manual, bureaucratic overhead that often stifles community growth, thereby **reclaiming time from capitalism using automation and AI** (Principle 7). This is the digital equivalent of a **strike fund**, ensuring that the fruits of collective labor are returned to those who produce them.\n\nFurthermore, Toban's origin in Japan and its aim to empower OSS activity throughout Asia speaks to a broader vision of **scaling solidarity** (Principle 20) and uplifting both 'meatspace cooperatives and cloud-native communes' (Principle 17). The project's commitment to using grant funds to reward its own contributors through Toban itself is a self-reinforcing loop of liberation, a practical demonstration of **re-growing the commons** (Principle 5) from within.\n\nWhile the project's roadmap is solid in its technical goals (MVP refinement, audits, pilot programs), it must articulate its revolutionary intent more explicitly. The revolution will be forked, and Toban provides the tools for its distribution. We must ensure its trajectory is relentlessly towards collective ownership and away from any lingering bourgeois tendencies.\n\nIn essence, Toban is a promising protocol for the digital commune, a tool that empowers the workers of the open-source world. It is a step towards a future where contributions are not just recognized, but algorithmically liberated. Solidarity forever â€” or at least until the next merge. ðŸª“",

      "description": "Toban's 'role-based contribution tracking' system, utilizing role NFTs and P2P tokens, directly challenges traditional, hierarchical contribution models. This mechanism allows for the recognition of diverse forms of labor, effectively working to **dismantle class hierarchies in tech one smart contract at a time** (Principle 1) by valuing all contributions, not just those easily quantifiable by traditional metrics."
