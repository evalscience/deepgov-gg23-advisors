          "answer": "Our project, Toban, is a tool designed to help communities record contributions and distribute rewards fairly. While contributing to OSS is easy to start, few people stay long enough to make sustained contributions — a major challenge for OSS maintainers.\n\nNo matter how much effort is spent onboarding new contributors, if they leave quickly, it’s hard to create lasting impact. This is especially true for new or experimental projects that haven't yet proven successful.\n\nToban is inspired by the Protocol Guild model — it rewards contributors more the longer they stay involved and allows for retrospective reward distribution when a project succeeds.\n\nAnother unique aspect is that Toban originated in Japan and aims to empower OSS activity throughout Asia, creating more vibrant, regional OSS ecosystems.",

          "answer": "Toban’s key innovation is role-based contribution tracking. There are many great tools like Dework, Coordinape, and Praise that we've used ourselves, but most rely on task-based management or peer evaluation.\n\nTask-based tools struggle with fair pricing of tasks, and the steps from creating to reviewing tasks are often too cumbersome to maintain. Peer evaluations require deep awareness of the community’s activities and can be emotionally challenging when it comes to ranking others.\n\nToban addresses these issues by using role NFTs (representing abstracted responsibilities) and peer-to-peer tokens that members send when they’ve received help. These tokens act as signals to calculate contribution levels in a lightweight and ongoing way.\n\nBeyond tracking, Toban integrates with Splits Protocol to automate ERC20 or native token distribution to contributors, all at once — a powerful feature that reduces operational overhead.",
