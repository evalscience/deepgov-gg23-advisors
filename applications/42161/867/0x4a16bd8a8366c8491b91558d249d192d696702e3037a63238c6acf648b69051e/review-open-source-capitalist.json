  "summary": "Toban is a DAO tool designed to enhance contribution tracking and reward distribution in open-source software (OSS) communities and other collaborative projects. It introduces a role-based contribution tracking system, which aims to address the challenges of task-based and peer-based evaluation systems. The project is focused on promoting sustainable activities in OSS communities by ensuring contributions are recognized and rewarded. Toban is developed with a focus on interoperability with global DAO tools and protocols, and it aims to expand its impact across Asia and beyond.",
  "review": "The Toban project presents a compelling approach to addressing the challenges faced by OSS communities in tracking contributions and distributing rewards. By introducing a role-based contribution tracking system, Toban aims to overcome the limitations of traditional task-based and peer-based evaluation systems. This innovative approach aligns well with the round's focus on enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability, as well as contributing to financial inclusion and social impact. \n\nThe project demonstrates a clear understanding of the needs of internet-native collaborative activities and offers a solution that is both user-centric and scalable. Toban's integration with existing DAO tools and protocols further enhances its potential for broad impact. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the specific metrics used to evaluate contributions and the mechanisms in place to ensure fair and transparent reward distribution.\n\nOverall, Toban aligns well with the constitutional principles and values outlined in the model specification, particularly in terms of promoting long-term systemic change and innovation. The project's focus on interoperability and its potential to scale across different regions make it a strong candidate for funding.",
