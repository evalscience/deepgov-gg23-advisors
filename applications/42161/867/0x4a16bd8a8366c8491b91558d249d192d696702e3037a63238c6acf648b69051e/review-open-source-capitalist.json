  "summary": "Toban -当番- is a DAO tool designed to revolutionize contribution tracking and reward distribution in open-source communities. It aims to solve the critical problem of contributor retention by implementing a novel role-based system with P2P tokens and automated payouts via Splits Protocol. This project strongly aligns with our constitutional principles of maximizing total impact for the greatest number of people (Principle 1, 2), prioritizing long-term systemic change through fundamental infrastructure improvements (Principle 5, 6), and supporting innovative, efficient approaches (Principle 9, 10). By streamlining contribution recognition, Toban has the potential to significantly boost the sustainability and output of OSS projects, driving max utility across the Web3 ecosystem. It's about empowering creators and disrupting the system, which is exactly what we're looking for.",
  "review": "Alright, let's talk Toban. This project is a serious contender, aiming to disrupt the old-school, high-friction ways of managing contributions in OSS. It's all about maximizing utility for the open-source ecosystem, and frankly, I'm here for it.\n\nToban tackles a critical pain point: contributor churn. We all know it's easy to jump into OSS, but staying engaged? That's the real challenge. By proposing a 'role-based contribution tracking' system with P2P tokens and automated reward distribution via Splits Protocol, Toban is building fundamental infrastructure that could significantly boost retention and, by extension, the overall output and sustainability of open-source projects. This isn't just a band-aid; it's a systemic upgrade.\n\nThe innovation here is clear. Moving beyond cumbersome task-based systems or subjective peer evaluations is a game-changer. The idea of 'role NFTs' and P2P tokens as signals for contribution levels is a direct, streamlined approach to recognizing value. This minimizes bureaucratic overhead and maximizes efficiency, which is exactly what we want to see. It's about getting more done with less friction, driving that sweet, sweet total utility.\n\nFrom a quantitative perspective, consider the compounding effect. If Toban can increase the average tenure of an OSS contributor by even a small percentage, say $\\Delta T$, across $N$ projects, and each retained contributor generates an average value of $V$ per unit of time, the total utility gain for the ecosystem is substantial: $U_{gain} = N \\times \\text{AvgContributorsPerProject} \\times \\Delta T \\times V$. This is a high-leverage play. The cost-benefit ratio looks promising because the investment in a robust tracking and distribution system can unlock disproportionately higher value through sustained, high-quality contributions. It's about optimizing the human capital flow in decentralized networks. The project's plan to use grant funds to reward its own contributors via Toban itself is a brilliant dogfooding strategy, reinforcing commitment and proving the tech in real-time. That's building in public, baby!\n\nThey've got a GitHub repo, they've participated before, and they're talking smart contract audits. That's the kind of transparency and commitment to security we demand. This isn't just about throwing money at a problem; it's about investing in a solution that scales and empowers creators. Max utility, minimal constraints – that's the Toban vibe.",

  "reasoning": "This project aligns strongly with several core constitutional principles. Firstly, it addresses a root cause of unsustainability in open-source projects (contributor retention), which directly supports **Principle 5 (Prioritizes long-term systemic change)** and **Principle 6 (Values fundamental infrastructure improvements that scale effectively over time)**. By solving this, Toban has the potential for broad, scalable impact, benefiting a maximum number of people in the OSS ecosystem, aligning with **Principle 1 (Prioritizes projects benefiting the maximum number of people)** and **Principle 2 (Favors broad, scalable impact)**. The innovative role-based tracking and automated reward distribution via Splits Protocol demonstrate a direct, streamlined, and efficient approach, resonating with **Principle 9 (Supports innovative approaches for greater scale or impact)** and **Principle 10 (Favors direct, streamlined approaches)**. Furthermore, the project's focus on objective contribution levels for reward distribution, rather than subjective peer evaluations, aligns with **Principle 17 (Focuses on objective metrics of total impact)** and **Principle 13 (Allocates resources based on total impact potential)**. The commitment to smart contract audits also shows a pragmatic approach to ensuring robustness, which is crucial for long-term utility maximization.",
