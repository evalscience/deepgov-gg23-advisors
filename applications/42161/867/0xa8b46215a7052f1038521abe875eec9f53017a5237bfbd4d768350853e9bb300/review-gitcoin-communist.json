  "summary": "SafeNotes is an open-source project designed to enhance transparency and accountability in DAO operations by annotating SAFE multisig transactions with human-readable context. The project aims to transform opaque transaction histories into meaningful public records, allowing DAOs to categorize and describe each transaction. This initiative empowers communities to audit spending, hold leaders accountable, and improve governance, promoting a culture of openness across DAO ecosystems.",
  "review": "The SafeNotes project presents a compelling case for enhancing transparency and accountability within DAO operations. By providing a platform that annotates SAFE multisig transactions with human-readable context, it addresses a significant gap in the current ecosystem. The project's open-source nature aligns well with the round's eligibility criteria, promoting the growth of the OSS ecosystem. However, the application lacks detailed information on measurable outcomes and a sustainable revenue model, which are crucial for long-term viability. Additionally, while the project aims to onboard more DAOs, the application does not provide a clear plan or timeline for achieving this goal. The absence of deployer addresses for smart contracts is also a notable omission, as it limits the ability to verify the project's deployment and operational status. Overall, SafeNotes has the potential to contribute significantly to the Web3 ecosystem, but it requires more detailed planning and evidence of impact to fully meet the model specification's principles.",
