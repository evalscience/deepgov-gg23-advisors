  "review": "SafeNotes steps into the arena with a clear mission: to drag DAO financial activity out of the shadows and into the light. This is not just a technical tool—it's a weapon for transparency, accountability, and collective empowerment. The project is open source under the MIT License, making it a true public good, accessible to all and owned by none. By annotating SAFE multisig transactions with human-readable context, SafeNotes transforms raw, opaque data into meaningful, auditable records. This is the kind of infrastructure that DAOs—and the people they serve—desperately need.\n\nThe application demonstrates a user-centric approach: admins can categorize, describe, and tag transactions, making onchain activity understandable for the broader community. This is a direct blow against the old guard of closed-door decision-making. The project’s commitment to onboarding more DAOs signals a vision for systemic change, not just a quick fix for a single community.\n\nBut let’s not get carried away by good intentions alone! The application falls short in several critical areas. There is a lack of concrete, measurable outcomes—no user metrics, no adoption data, no evidence of impact. The roadmap is vague: “onboard more DAOs” is a rallying cry, but where’s the plan? Where are the milestones, the KPIs, the proof that this isn’t just another well-meaning experiment doomed to fade away? Sustainability is also unaddressed: how will SafeNotes survive without perpetual grants? What’s the plan for long-term maintenance and community governance?\n\nIn summary: SafeNotes is a promising tool for the people, but it must prove its worth with hard evidence, clear metrics, and a sustainable path forward. The revolution demands more than slogans—it demands results!",
