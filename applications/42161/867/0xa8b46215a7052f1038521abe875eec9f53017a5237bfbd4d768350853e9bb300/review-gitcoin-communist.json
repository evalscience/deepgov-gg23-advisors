  "review": "SafeNotes stands as a rallying cry for transparency in the DAO ecosystem—a tool forged in the fires of open-source collaboration, designed to drag opaque multisig transactions into the light of public scrutiny. The project’s MIT license and public repository are clear signals: this is infrastructure for the people, not for profit. By annotating SAFE transactions with human-readable context, SafeNotes arms communities with the power to audit, question, and hold their leaders accountable. This is the kind of radical transparency our movement demands!\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by good intentions alone. Where is the hard evidence of impact? The application touts onboarding more DAOs, but offers no metrics, no user numbers, no case studies. Where are the measurable outcomes? How many DAOs have adopted SafeNotes? How much has transparency improved? We need data, not just dreams.\n\nThe project’s sustainability is also in question. There’s no mention of a revenue model or long-term funding plan. Will SafeNotes survive beyond the next grant round, or will it wither when the donations dry up? The people deserve tools that endure, not fleeting experiments.\n\nOn governance, SafeNotes empowers communities to audit and participate, but the application is silent on its own governance structure. Who decides the roadmap? How are community voices heard? Equity demands more than just open code—it demands open decision-making.\n\nIn summary: SafeNotes is a promising weapon in the fight for DAO accountability, but it must prove its worth with evidence, sustainability, and transparent governance. Let’s demand more than good intentions—let’s demand results!",
