  "summary": "SafeNotes is an open-source project aimed at enhancing transparency and accountability in DAO operations by annotating SAFE multisig transactions with human-readable context. The project is designed to make on-chain activity understandable, allowing communities to audit spending and improve governance. The application is part of the GG23 OSS - dApps and Apps round, which focuses on accelerating the adoption and development of open-source dApps and apps that offer novel utilities or services within the ecosystem.",
  "review": "The SafeNotes project presents a compelling case for enhancing transparency and accountability within DAO operations. By providing a platform that annotates SAFE multisig transactions with human-readable context, it addresses a significant need for clarity in on-chain activities. This aligns well with the round's focus on open-source dApps and apps that contribute to the Web3 ecosystem's growth. The project demonstrates user-centric design by allowing transactions to be categorized and described, which is crucial for community auditing and governance improvement. However, the application lacks detailed information on the project's current impact, user adoption metrics, and specific plans for scaling. Additionally, while the project is open-source, the application does not provide a clear roadmap for future development or how the grant funds will be utilized to achieve these goals. The absence of deployer addresses for smart contracts is noted, although marked as 'n/a', which may indicate a lack of deployment or oversight in the application process.",
