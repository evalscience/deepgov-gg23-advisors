  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. SafeNotes is gunning for transparency in DAO ops by slapping human-readable context on SAFE multisig transactions. No more squinting at raw hashes—now you get categories like “Q1 Developer Grants” or “Delegate Compensation.” That’s a big win for onchain accountability and governance. The MIT License and open repo check the open-source box, and the app’s auto-pull of SAFE txs plus admin tagging is a slick, user-centric feature. \n\nFrom a maximization lens, SafeNotes has the potential to scale across DAOs, not just a niche club. If widely adopted, it could set a new standard for DAO transparency—think systemic impact, not just a one-off tool. The roadmap is a bit thin (\"onboard more DAOs\" is vague), but the core infra is there. The app is differentiated by its focus on making onchain activity legible and actionable, which is a root-cause fix for DAO opacity.\n\nBut let’s not sugarcoat it: the application is light on specifics. There’s no hard data on current adoption, no metrics on impact, and the dev plan is basically “get more users.” For a grant at this level, I want to see a concrete growth strategy, measurable KPIs, and a breakdown of how funds will turbocharge adoption. Also, the smart contract deployment info is missing (\"n/a\"), which is a red flag for transparency in a transparency tool. \n\nBottom line: killer concept, solid OSS cred, but needs more meat on the execution and impact bones. Ship fast, but show your work!",
