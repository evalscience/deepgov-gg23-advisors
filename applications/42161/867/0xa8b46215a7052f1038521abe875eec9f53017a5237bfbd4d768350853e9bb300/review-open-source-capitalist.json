  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. SafeNotes is gunning for transparency in DAO ops by slapping human-readable context on SAFE multisig transactions. No more squinting at raw tx hashes—now you get categories, descriptions, and admin controls to make sense of the onchain spaghetti. The code is MIT-licensed and open-source, so anyone can fork, ship, or remix. That’s a big plus for OSS ethos and ecosystem compounding.\n\nOn the impact front, SafeNotes is targeting a root cause: opaque DAO spending. By making transactions legible, it empowers communities to audit, hold leaders accountable, and level up governance. That’s a systemic play, not just a band-aid. The plan to onboard more DAOs is a clear path to scale, and the automation (auto-pulling SAFE txs) is a solid efficiency win—no manual grind.\n\nBut let’s not sugarcoat it: the app’s differentiation is a bit thin. Tagging and categorizing txs is useful, but not exactly a moonshot in terms of innovation. There’s no mention of advanced features (analytics, integrations, or cross-chain support), and the roadmap is vague. The application is also light on metrics, adoption data, and concrete milestones. No public group chat or community engagement details—missed opportunity for network effects. And the smart contract deployment info is missing (\"n/a\"), which is a compliance gap for full transparency.\n\nBottom line: SafeNotes is a solid infra play with real utility for DAOs, but it needs to crank up the ambition and clarity to hit max impact. Show us the scale, show us the numbers, and let’s see some next-level features. Build in public, disrupt harder!",
