Carbon credits have Certifications like Redd+ that attest to the quality of the carbon vintage.

Rehauling our Taxonomy\n\nThe current Regen Atlas green crypto-asset taxonomy is somewhat dated given innovation in the sector and our evolving understanding of green finance nomenclature. With proceeds from this round, we will update the taxonomy and all corresponding database entries in our aggregator.\n\n2. A Green Crypto-Asset Market Metrics Dashboard\n\n\nWork has already begun on this project. Essentially, we are building a dashboard to track the growth of green crypto-assets in real-time, using our database as reference and plugging into existing APIs such as Coingecko. By tracking the market size of the green crypto-asset sector, we can prove real growth and help drive investment towards it.\n\n3. Addition of Organizations\n\nRecently, there has been an explosion in projects leveraging Web3 to do regenerative and sustainable work, such as Celo Regional DAOs, Greenpill Network and ReFi DAO chapters, and more. We plan to add all of these Orgs and their respective nodes to the Regen Atlas, to better understack the growing Web3 localist ecosystem.\n",
