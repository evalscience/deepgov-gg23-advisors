  "summary": "Regen Atlas is an open-source platform that aggregates green crypto-assets, aiming to enhance transparency and innovation in the green cryptoeconomy. The project has made significant progress in expanding its database and developing backend management tools. It plans to update its taxonomy, create a market cap dashboard, and add organizational filters to further support the green crypto ecosystem.",
  "review": "Regen Atlas presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's focus on open-source dApps that enhance Web3 accessibility and usability. The project demonstrates a strong commitment to the open-source ethos, with a clear focus on environmental sustainability and social impact. The application highlights significant progress since the last funding round, including database expansion and admin panel development, which are crucial for managing and scaling the platform effectively. The proposed updates to the taxonomy and the development of a market cap dashboard are innovative steps that could significantly enhance the project's impact.\n\nHowever, the application lacks detailed information on measurable outcomes and quantifiable results, which are essential for evaluating the project's success. Additionally, while the project mentions the use of existing smart contracts, it does not provide a clear plan for developing its own smart contract solutions, which could enhance its independence and innovation. The application could also benefit from a more detailed explanation of its governance structure and how it plans to ensure equitable distribution of benefits across different communities.",
