  "summary": "Regen Atlas is an open-source platform that aggregates green crypto-assets, aiming to enhance transparency and innovation in the green cryptoeconomy. The project seeks to address inefficiencies in traditional green finance by providing a comprehensive interface for discovering and trading green crypto-assets. The application outlines plans for taxonomy updates, a market cap dashboard, and an organization filter to expand its offerings.",
  "review": "The Regen Atlas project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's focus on open-source dApps that enhance Web3 accessibility and usability. The project contributes to the growth of the OSS ecosystem by providing a platform that aggregates green crypto-assets, thus promoting transparency and innovation in the green finance sector. The application highlights significant progress since the last round, including database expansion and admin panel development, which demonstrates a commitment to continuous improvement and scalability. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on user-centric design and functionality, as well as a clearer explanation of how the project directly contributes to financial inclusion and social impact. Additionally, while the project outlines ambitious future plans, it would be beneficial to see more concrete timelines and metrics for success.",
