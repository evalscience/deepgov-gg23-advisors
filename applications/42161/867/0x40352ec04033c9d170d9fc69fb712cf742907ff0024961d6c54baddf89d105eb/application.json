Our project contributes to the OSS ecosystem in three key ways:\n\nOpen Access to Multi-Chain Transaction Visualization\nTxCity supports multiple blockchains and we’re continuously adding more. By open-sourcing our visualization engine, anyone can fork or extend our codebase to support additional chains, build educational tools, or create their own versions of transaction explorers.\n\nOnboarding New Developers with Accessible UI/UX\nMost blockchain explorers are data heavy and intimidating for newcomers. TxCity makes blockchain approachable through gamified, character based visualizations turning every transaction into a story. This inspires OSS developers, educators, and hackers to experiment with blockchain data in creative ways",

Each transaction becomes a character, each block becomes a bus, and the entire network activity unfolds like a living, breathing digital city.\n\nKey Features & Use Cases:\nReal-Time Transaction Visualization\nUsers can watch live on-chain activity as animated characters board buses (blocks), making blockchain activity tangible and engaging.\n\nMulti-Chain Support\nTxCity already supports 10 chains with more chains onboarding. It’s a multi chain explorer that visualizes cross-chain activity in one consistent interface.\n\nGamified Learning & Education\nDesigned for both developers and non-technical users, TxCity is used by educators and community managers to demystify blockchain helping users understand how wallets, smart contracts, and transactions interact.\n\nOnboarding & Ecosystem Growth Tool\nProtocols and chains use TxCity to showcase activity, attract new users, and promote transparency.
