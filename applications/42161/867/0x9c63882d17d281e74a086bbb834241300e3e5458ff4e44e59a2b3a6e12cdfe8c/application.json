([contributors](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/ethernaut/graphs/contributors))\n2. **Educational Resources**: The Ethernaut’s repository and discussions act as reference material for other educational or training platforms. Many bootcamps and university courses integrate Ethernaut challenges into their syllabi.\n3. **Open Collaboration**: Whether it’s translations, UI improvements, or feature enhancements, anyone can contribute.

Maintained by OpenZeppelin, each level provides a gamified experience where a smart contract must be ‘hacked’ to progress. It is 100% open-source, with all levels contributed by players.\n\nIn 2024, we have continued expanding the game, adding four new advanced levels—HigherOrder, Stake, Impersonator, and Magic Animal Carousel—which explore current vulnerabilities in smart contract development. These levels introduce challenges related to low-level EVM programming, staking vulnerabilities, signature verification exploits, and bitwise manipulation attacks, pushing players to deepen their understanding of Ethereum security.\n\nBeyond new levels, we have also redesigned the UI, added support for multiple networks, and expanded language translations to make the game more accessible to a global audience.\n\nWe believe that The Ethernaut is an essential training tool for developers across the Ethereum ecosystem. By continually evolving the game with new challenges and features, we strive to make smart contract security education engaging, practical, and accessible to everyone.",

      "description": "The Ethernaut is a community-driven capture-the-flag wargame that challenges developers of all levels to break smart contracts while learning common Solidity vulnerabilities. Maintained by OpenZeppelin, each level provides a gamified experience where a smart contract must be ‘hacked’ to progress. It is 100% open-source, with all levels contributed by players.\n\nIn 2024, we have continued expanding the game, adding four new advanced levels—HigherOrder, Stake, Impersonator, and Magic Animal Carousel—which explore current vulnerabilities in smart contract development. These levels introduce challenges related to low-level EVM programming, staking vulnerabilities, signature verification exploits, and bitwise manipulation attacks, pushing players to deepen their understanding of Ethereum security.\n\nBeyond new levels, we have also redesigned the UI, added support for multiple networks, and expanded language translations to make the game more accessible to a global audience.\n\nWe believe that The Ethernaut is an essential training tool for developers across the Ethereum ecosystem. By continually evolving the game with new challenges and features, we strive to make smart contract security education engaging, practical, and accessible to everyone.",
