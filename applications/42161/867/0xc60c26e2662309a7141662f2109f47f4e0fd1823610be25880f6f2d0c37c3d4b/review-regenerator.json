  "summary": "Privatefolio is an open-source portfolio tracker designed to enhance user privacy and control by operating entirely on the user's device without a backend server. The project aims to expand its features with a focus on user-centric design, including a desktop app, SQL database integration, and secure cloud solutions. The grant will be used to fund further development and community growth, with a plan to distribute funds through code bounties.",
  "review": "The Privatefolio project presents a compelling case for funding within the GG23 OSS - dApps and Apps round. It aligns well with the round's focus on open-source dApps that enhance Web3 accessibility and usability. The project's local-first architecture ensures user data privacy, a significant innovation in the portfolio tracking space. The planned features for version 2, such as a desktop app and secure cloud solutions, demonstrate a commitment to user-centric design and functionality, meeting the round's requirements. However, the application lacks detailed information on how the project will engage with the community and incorporate diverse stakeholder input, which is crucial for aligning with the Community Participation Principles outlined in the model specification. Additionally, while the project is innovative, it does not explicitly address environmental sustainability, which is a key consideration in the model specification. Overall, Privatefolio is a promising project with strong potential for impact, but it would benefit from a clearer strategy for community engagement and sustainability.",
