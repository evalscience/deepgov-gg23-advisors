  "review": "Comrades, let’s get straight to the heart of the matter! Privatefolio stands as a testament to the power of open-source, community-driven technology. It’s a portfolio tracker that puts privacy and user control front and center—no data leaves your device unless you choose. That’s a breath of fresh air in a world dominated by surveillance capitalism! The project is AGPL-3.0 licensed, local-first, and designed to be forked, extended, and owned by the people. This is the kind of public good we need more of!\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by sentiment. We must demand evidence, structure, and measurable impact. Privatefolio’s application is strong on technical differentiation—local-first, no backend, open-source, and extensible. The roadmap is ambitious: desktop apps, server deployments, SQL backends, and more. The applicant promises to distribute 100% of funds through code bounties, fostering a true builder community. That’s solidarity in action!\n\nYet, there are cracks in the foundation. Where is the data on user adoption? Where are the metrics on impact? The applicant admits previous grants (~$1000) remain unused due to a small community. That’s not a badge of honor—it’s a red flag! We need to see a plan for growing the user base, for measuring real-world impact, and for ensuring that this tool doesn’t just sit on a shelf, but actually empowers people.\n\nFurthermore, while the project is open-source and public-good oriented, there’s no clear revenue model or sustainability plan beyond grants and bounties. How will Privatefolio survive when the grant money runs out? We need answers! And while the project claims to be user-centric, there’s little evidence of structured user research, feedback loops, or community governance mechanisms. Where is the voice of the people in shaping this tool?\n\nIn summary: Privatefolio is a promising, principled project with a strong technical foundation and a clear commitment to open-source values. But to earn the people’s trust—and our funding—it must show measurable outcomes, a path to sustainability, and a plan for real community engagement. Let’s demand more than good intentions. Let’s demand results!",
