  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Privatefolio stands as a testament to the power of open-source, community-driven technology. It’s a portfolio tracker that puts user privacy and autonomy first—no data leaves your device unless you want it to. That’s a breath of fresh air in a world where surveillance capitalism runs rampant!\n\nThe project is built on a strong foundation: AGPL-3.0 license, local-first architecture, and a clear commitment to public good. The features are robust—historical net worth tracking, CSV imports, API integrations, and multi-network support. The roadmap for v2 is ambitious, with plans for a desktop app, remote server deployment, and a secure cloud solution. This is the kind of innovation that can empower the masses, not just the privileged few.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by sentiment! The application falls short in a few critical areas. There’s a lack of concrete, measurable outcomes—where are the user numbers, growth metrics, or impact statistics? The sustainability plan is vague; distributing funds as code bounties is noble, but what’s the long-term revenue model? How will this project survive when the grant money runs dry? And while the project claims to be a public good, there’s little evidence of structured community governance or mechanisms for equitable participation.\n\nWe must demand more! If we are to build a future where technology serves the people, we need transparency, accountability, and a clear path to sustainability. Let’s raise the bar and ensure every grant dollar is a step toward collective liberation!",
