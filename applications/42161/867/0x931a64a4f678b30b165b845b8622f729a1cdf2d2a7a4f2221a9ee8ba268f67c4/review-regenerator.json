  "review": "ArbiLearn presents a compelling case for funding with its focus on making Web3 education accessible and engaging through gamified learning and financial incentives. The project aligns well with the round's eligibility criteria by contributing to Web3 ecosystem growth and enhancing accessibility. The use of NFTs for membership and the integration of a peeping system for seamless exploration of blockchain ecosystems are innovative features that differentiate ArbiLearn from traditional educational platforms. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on how community participation is integrated into the platform's governance and decision-making processes. Additionally, while the project emphasizes accessibility and engagement, it should also consider incorporating environmental sustainability principles into its development plans. Overall, ArbiLearn is a promising initiative with potential for significant impact in the Web3 education space.",
