  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get to the alpha. ArbiLearn is gunning to be the on-ramp for Web3 education, especially in emerging markets. The project is open-source, gamified, and rewards users with crypto for learning—think Duolingo meets DeFi. The MVP is live, the code is public, and the founder is building in public. That’s a solid start.\n\nOn the impact front, ArbiLearn is swinging for the fences: onboarding 10,000+ new users, scaling to multi-chain, and pushing open-source contributions. The focus on non-technical users and underserved regions is a big plus for ecosystem growth. The \"peeping system\" (multi-chain exploration without leaving the platform) is a slick differentiator, and the NFT-gated access plus DAO roadmap shows ambition for decentralized governance.\n\nBut let’s not get lost in the hype. There are some red flags. The project is a solo dev shop—major scaling and sustainability risks. The roadmap is ambitious, but the execution plan is light on specifics. There’s no hard data on current user traction, retention, or real-world impact. The open-source repo is public, but the extent of community contributions and code quality isn’t clear from the app. Also, the funding breakdown is generic—\"40% platform, 25% content, 20% marketing, 15% bounties\"—but lacks granular milestones or KPIs. That’s not enough for max utility.\n\nFor a grant at this scale, I want to see more: hard metrics, clear milestones, and a plan for scaling beyond a one-person team. The vision is strong, but the execution needs to be battle-tested. Show me the receipts, not just the roadmap.\n\nCitations: All analysis based on the provided application, round requirements, and the open-source capitalist model specification. No external research was referenced due to lack of additional data.\n\nBottom line: ArbiLearn is high-potential, but needs to level up on transparency, execution, and scalability to hit max impact. Don’t just build in public—prove in public.",
