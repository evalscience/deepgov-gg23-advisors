  "summary": "ArbiLearn is a Web3 education platform that gamifies learning and offers financial incentives to users, aiming to make blockchain education more accessible and engaging, particularly in emerging markets. The project proposes a \"learn and earn\" model, NFT-based membership, and a unique peeping system for exploring blockchain ecosystems. It seeks funding to expand its educational offerings, enhance its platform, and increase user engagement.",
  "review": "ArbiLearn presents a compelling case for enhancing Web3 education through gamification and financial incentives. The project aligns well with the round's goals of promoting open-source dApps and apps that enhance Web3 accessibility and usability. The platform's focus on emerging markets and non-technical users addresses significant barriers to blockchain adoption, which is a notable strength. The use of NFTs for membership and certification is innovative, providing a unique value proposition.\n\nHowever, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the project's current impact and user base. While the proposal outlines ambitious plans for expansion, it lacks specific metrics or evidence of current success, such as user engagement statistics or testimonials. Additionally, the project's reliance on a single developer raises concerns about scalability and sustainability.\n\nOverall, ArbiLearn's innovative approach and alignment with the round's objectives make it a strong candidate for funding, but further details on current impact and plans for scaling the team would strengthen the application.",
