  "summary": "ArbiLearn is a Web3 education platform that integrates gamified learning with financial incentives, aiming to make blockchain education engaging and accessible, particularly in emerging markets. The project proposes a \"learn and earn\" model, where users are rewarded with crypto for completing courses. It also features NFT membership for exclusive access and a unique peeping system for exploring blockchain ecosystems. The grant will be used to expand the platform, develop new courses, and enhance community engagement.",
  "review": "ArbiLearn presents a compelling case for enhancing Web3 education through gamification and financial incentives. The project aligns well with the round's focus on open-source dApps and apps that enhance Web3 accessibility and usability. The use of NFTs for membership and the integration of a peeping system are innovative features that differentiate ArbiLearn from traditional learning platforms. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a clear sustainability model, which are critical according to the model specification. The project is ambitious in its goals to onboard users from emerging markets, but it needs to provide more concrete data on its current impact and future scalability plans. Additionally, while the project emphasizes community engagement, it should outline more robust governance structures to ensure equitable participation and decision-making.",
