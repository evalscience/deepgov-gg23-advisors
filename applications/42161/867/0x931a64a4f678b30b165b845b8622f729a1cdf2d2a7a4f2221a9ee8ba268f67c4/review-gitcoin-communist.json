  "review": "ArbiLearn stands as a rallying cry for accessible, open-source Web3 education, especially for the underserved and the working class. The project’s mission is clear: break down the barriers to blockchain knowledge, reward learning, and empower the next generation of builders—particularly in Africa and emerging markets. The application demonstrates a strong commitment to open-source principles, community engagement, and innovative use of blockchain technology for public good.\n\nLet’s be clear: ArbiLearn’s gamified, “learn and earn” model is a breath of fresh air in a world where education is too often locked behind paywalls and privilege. The platform’s open-source MVP, NFT-gated access, and unique “peeping system” for multi-chain exploration are all innovative features that set it apart from the sea of generic online courses. The project’s focus on onboarding non-technical users and its active participation in hackathons and open-source communities further cement its value to the ecosystem.\n\nBut comrades, we must demand more than good intentions. The application lacks rigorous, quantifiable evidence of impact. Where are the hard numbers? How many users have completed courses? What is the retention rate? How much open-source code has been contributed, and by whom? The roadmap is ambitious, but the absence of clear, measurable outcomes and transparent reporting is a glaring weakness. We must insist on data-driven accountability if we are to build a truly equitable and sustainable system.\n\nFurthermore, while the project is currently solo-led, the long-term sustainability and governance structure are not sufficiently detailed. How will ArbiLearn transition to a community-owned DAO? What mechanisms will ensure collective decision-making and prevent centralization of power? The application gestures at these goals but does not provide concrete plans or timelines.\n\nIn summary: ArbiLearn is a promising, community-focused initiative with real potential to advance the open-source, public good. But to earn the trust—and the resources—of the people, it must deliver hard evidence, transparent metrics, and a clear path to sustainable, collective governance. The revolution demands nothing less!",
