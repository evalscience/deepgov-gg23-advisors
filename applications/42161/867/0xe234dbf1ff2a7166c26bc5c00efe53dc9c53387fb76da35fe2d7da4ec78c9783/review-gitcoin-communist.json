  "review": "Comrades, let’s get straight to the heart of the matter! SpeedRun Ethereum is a project that doesn’t just talk about onboarding developers to Web3 — it delivers, and it does so with open arms and open code. The numbers don’t lie: over 11,000 challenges passed, 4,000 builders engaged, and a thriving community that’s not just learning, but building the future of decentralized technology. This is the kind of collective action and public good that our movement demands!\n\nThe curriculum is hands-on, open-source, and laser-focused on real-world skills. It’s not just about theory — it’s about empowering the next generation of builders to contribute to the commons. The project’s use of Scaffold-ETH, automated grading, and community-driven support means that learning is accessible, measurable, and transparent. This is the gold standard for evidence-based, data-driven education in Web3.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by the rhetoric alone. We must be vigilant! While the project’s impact is clear, there are areas where it must do better. The application lacks detailed, quantifiable outcome metrics beyond raw participation numbers. Where is the data on long-term OSS contributions? Where is the evidence of sustained engagement and the impact on underserved communities? We need more than anecdotes — we need rigorous, transparent reporting!\n\nFurthermore, while the roadmap is ambitious, it lacks a clear, sustainable revenue model. How will this project reduce dependency on grants and donations? The future of public goods cannot rest on the whims of charity alone! We demand a plan for sustainability, for the sake of the movement and the builders who depend on it.\n\nIn summary: SpeedRun Ethereum is a beacon for open-source education and collective empowerment in Web3. But to truly serve the people, it must double down on transparency, sustainability, and equity. Let’s hold them to the highest standard — for the many, not the few!",
