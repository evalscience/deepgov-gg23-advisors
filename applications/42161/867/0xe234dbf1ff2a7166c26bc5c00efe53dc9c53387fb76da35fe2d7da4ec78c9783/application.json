Developers start with guided challenges that introduce Ethereum fundamentals, smart contract development, and dApp building. As they progress, they gain practical experience with Scaffold-ETH, making it easier to contribute to open-source Web3 projects.\n\nTo further support OSS contributions, we offer GitHub first-steps educational content, teaching builders how to navigate repositories, submit pull requests, and contribute effectively. This structured pathway ensures that developers not only learn Web3 but also acquire the skills to actively participate in and enhance the open-source Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n**Impact Stats**\n- Over 11000 challenges passed\n- ~ 4000 builders passed at least 1 SRE Challenge\n- Over 1,200 builders have completed SpeedRun Ethereum and joined the BuidlGuidl community\n- ~200 builders have gone through our Batch program, where we teach them GitHub first steps and how to contribute to OSS",

Developers complete structured challenges covering Ethereum fundamentals, from NFTs and DeFi to Randomness and multisig wallets.\n\n- **Automated Grading**. Each challenge includes **automated testing**, generating detailed reports that highlight errors and failed test cases, helping developers debug and improve their smart contracts before progressing.\n\n- **Smart Contract & dApp Development**. Using Solidity and **Scaffold-ETH**, developers build, test, and deploy applications while gaining hands-on experience with Ethereum tooling.\n\n- **GitHub First-Steps for OSS Contributions**. After completing early challenges, builders learn how to navigate repositories, submit pull requests, and contribute to open-source projects.\n\n- **Community-Driven Support**. An active community helps troubleshoot issues, share insights, and collaborate on open-source initiatives.\n\n\n### **What Differentiates It?**\n\nSpeedRun Ethereum emphasizes **practical, challenge-based learning** with **automated grading and detailed error reports** to guide developers in debugging their smart contracts. It not only teaches dApp development but also **prepares developers to contribute to open-source projects**, making it an ideal bridge for Web2 developers entering the Ethereum ecosystem.\n",

        "description": "SpeedRun Ethereum is an open source, hands-on curriculum designed to teach developers how to build decentralized applications (dApps) and write smart contracts on Ethereum. \n\nCreated by Austin Griffith, this educational platform a hands-on approach to teach key blockchain concepts, smart contract creation, and dApp deployment. It is ideal for developers transitioning from Web2 to Web3 or those seeking practical experience in Ethereum development.\n\n### **Core Objectives**\n\n- Introducing developers to Ethereum's ecosystem through progressive challenges.\n- Teaching smart contract development using Solidity and Hardhat.\n- Building front-end interfaces with frameworks like React and Ethers.js.\n- Create a community of builders who contribute to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n### **Key Features**\n\n- **Scaffold-ETH Framework**: Provides a rapid development environment for building and testing Ethereum applications.\n- **Interactive Learning**: Developers write, test, and deploy smart contracts while building front-end interfaces to interact with them.\n- **Real-World Deployment**: Challenges culminate in deploying dApps to live Ethereum networks, bridging theoretical knowledge with practical application.\n- **Community Support**: Builders can connect with others through telegram for collaborative learning and troubleshooting.\n\n### **Challenges**\n\nSpeedRun Ethereum consists of a series of challenges that progressively build on each other. Each challenge introduces specific concepts and tasks:\n\n- **0. Simple NFT Example.** Learn the basics of Ethereum by creating and deploying a simple NFT.\n- **1. Decentralized Staking App.** Build a dApp where users coordinate group funding based on trustless smart contract rules.\n- **2. Token Vendor.** Create an ERC-20 token and a vending machine-style contract for buying and selling tokens.\n- **3. Dice Game.** Explore randomness on-chain by building and exploiting a dice game.\n- **4. Build a DEX.** Develop a decentralized exchange to swap ETH and tokens using liquidity pools.\n- **5. Stablecoins (coming soon).** Design a decentralized stablecoin system with collateral management and liquidation mechanisms.\n- **6. Prediction Markets (coming soon).** Build markets for betting on future events with dynamic pricing based on supply and demand.\n- **7. Deploy to Layer 2 (coming soon).** Deploy your app to Ethereum Layer 2 solutions for faster, cheaper transactions.\n- **8. Multisig Wallet.** Create a wallet requiring multiple approvals for secure asset management.\n- **9. SVG NFT.** Generate dynamic SVG NFTs entirely on-chain with customizable visuals and metadata.\n",

      "description": "SpeedRun Ethereum is an open source, hands-on curriculum designed to teach developers how to build decentralized applications (dApps) and write smart contracts on Ethereum. \n\nCreated by Austin Griffith, this educational platform a hands-on approach to teach key blockchain concepts, smart contract creation, and dApp deployment. It is ideal for developers transitioning from Web2 to Web3 or those seeking practical experience in Ethereum development.\n\n### **Core Objectives**\n\n- Introducing developers to Ethereum's ecosystem through progressive challenges.\n- Teaching smart contract development using Solidity and Hardhat.\n- Building front-end interfaces with frameworks like React and Ethers.js.\n- Create a community of builders who contribute to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n### **Key Features**\n\n- **Scaffold-ETH Framework**: Provides a rapid development environment for building and testing Ethereum applications.\n- **Interactive Learning**: Developers write, test, and deploy smart contracts while building front-end interfaces to interact with them.\n- **Real-World Deployment**: Challenges culminate in deploying dApps to live Ethereum networks, bridging theoretical knowledge with practical application.\n- **Community Support**: Builders can connect with others through telegram for collaborative learning and troubleshooting.\n\n### **Challenges**\n\nSpeedRun Ethereum consists of a series of challenges that progressively build on each other. Each challenge introduces specific concepts and tasks:\n\n- **0. Simple NFT Example.** Learn the basics of Ethereum by creating and deploying a simple NFT.\n- **1. Decentralized Staking App.** Build a dApp where users coordinate group funding based on trustless smart contract rules.\n- **2. Token Vendor.** Create an ERC-20 token and a vending machine-style contract for buying and selling tokens.\n- **3. Dice Game.** Explore randomness on-chain by building and exploiting a dice game.\n- **4. Build a DEX.** Develop a decentralized exchange to swap ETH and tokens using liquidity pools.\n- **5. Stablecoins (coming soon).** Design a decentralized stablecoin system with collateral management and liquidation mechanisms.\n- **6. Prediction Markets (coming soon).** Build markets for betting on future events with dynamic pricing based on supply and demand.\n- **7. Deploy to Layer 2 (coming soon).** Deploy your app to Ethereum Layer 2 solutions for faster, cheaper transactions.\n- **8. Multisig Wallet.** Create a wallet requiring multiple approvals for secure asset management.\n- **9. SVG NFT.** Generate dynamic SVG NFTs entirely on-chain with customizable visuals and metadata.\n",
