  "summary": "MemeCatLandar is an innovative Web3 application that combines AI, DAO governance, and blockchain to create a unique meme calendar platform. It aims to enhance the open-source ecosystem by leveraging tools like Supabase and Next.js, and it plans to use grant funds for further development, including UI/UX improvements and community growth initiatives.",
  "review": "MemeCatLandar presents a novel approach to integrating meme culture with Web3 technology, offering features like AI-powered curation and DAO voting. The project contributes to the open-source ecosystem by using and enhancing tools like Supabase and Next.js, and it is fully open-source, encouraging community collaboration. However, the application lacks detailed information on user-centric design and functionality, which is a requirement for the grant round. Additionally, while the project is innovative, its impact on the broader Web3 ecosystem and its scalability potential are not clearly articulated. The application could benefit from a more detailed plan on how it intends to achieve long-term systemic change and address root causes rather than symptoms.",
