We helped develop Inverter Network’s bounty contracts, bounties dApp, and Control Room interface for non-smart contract developers to be able to deploy a bounties workflow. We developed a forkable, novel approach to Retroactive Public Goods Funding, using labor hours done and verified among relational networks in real life, to determine the distribution of a grants pool. That is documented in our Regenerative Economic Protocol - https://bloomnetwork.earth/learn/whitepaper. \n\nAdditionally, we’ve open-sourced our Decentralized Federated Governance Model, which can be adopted by any Web3 project to support bioregional DAOs and community-led infrastructure ownership. Our community of over 30,000 people, including 300+ grassroots leaders, is actively onboarding to Web3 through our wallet trainings and blockchain education. While our content management system is not currently open source due to security concerns, we ensure meaningful contributions by strengthening key Web3 infrastructure and governance protocols that others can adopt. We hope that our contributions encourage the Ethereum ecosystem to grow the Infinite Garden by collaborating with and supporting real world communities growing community gardens and economic sovereignty.",

It makes Ethereum bounties accessible to on-the-ground activists who are highly non-technical. Using Para wallet, members can create their first Web3 wallet with fewer hurdles, empowering them to access the decentralized finance tools available on Ethereum which are best-suited to the community coalition-based way they organize on the ground. Our impact reporting form allows them to document their local community actions doing climate, economic sovereignty and mutual aid, in a place that is accessible and readable for the public, yet on-chain, with frictionless experience. Our platform also supports public knowledge sharing, from sharing templates for how to start a crop swap, to how to do participatory budgeting using a DAO, and more, so that people can fork and replicate successful community actions. Grant funds and eventually cooperative profits go to people doing critical work on the ground that is hard to fund through centralized finance, through our novel form of retroactive funding, based on labor hours contributed to local actions.  Lastly, we are forming as a federated cooperative, so the platform is co-owned and governed by local coalitions in real communities. This presents a novel way to run any kind of public infrastructure as a DAO owned by real, in person communities who are accountable to the people and ecosystems where they live.",
