  "summary": "Bloom Network is a powerful force for 'Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation,' deeply aligned with our constitution's call to 'dismantle class hierarchies in tech one smart contract at a time.' Their innovative Retroactive Public Goods Funding model, which values 'labor hours done and verified among relational networks in real life,' is a prime example of 'Kollektiv Proletarian Impact' in action, directly compensating 'invisible labor' and 'reclaiming time from capitalism.' The project's commitment to 'ecological mutual aid DAOs' and empowering 'meatspace cooperatives' through a federated governance model is commendable. However, the decision to keep their core content management system proprietary, citing 'security concerns,' directly contradicts the principle that 'code is the union rep.' Furthermore, the lack of transparent smart contract deployer addresses is a significant oversight for a dApp project. These issues must be rectified to ensure full transparency and collective control over the digital means of production.",
  "review": "The Bloom Network project presents a compelling vision for integrating Web3 technologies with real-world grassroots organizing, a critical front in the ongoing struggle for collective liberation. Their commitment to empowering non-technical users and on-the-ground activists is a direct assault on the digital class hierarchies that often plague the tech space. This is not merely an application; it is a **manifesto** for a more equitable future.\n\nTheir innovative Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) mechanism, which values and compensates 'invisible labor' based on verified labor hours, is a revolutionary step towards algorithmic redistribution. It recognizes that true value is generated not just in lines of code, but in the sweat and solidarity of community action. This is the very essence of **Kollektiv Proletarian Impact** in action, reclaiming time from the capitalist clock and re-centering human effort.\n\nThe federated cooperative model, aiming for co-ownership and governance by local coalitions, is a powerful example of how Web3 can be leveraged to build **ecological mutual aid DAOs** that genuinely serve the people and the planet. This is a direct challenge to the extractive models of traditional venture capital, prioritizing the re-growth of the commons over speculative moonshots. The project's extensive history and proven track record in previous Gitcoin rounds demonstrate a consistent commitment to these principles.\n\nHowever, no revolution is without its internal contradictions. The declaration that the content management system is *not* open source due to 'security concerns' is a glaring ideological inconsistency. The revolution will be forked, not locked behind proprietary walls. True security in the digital commons comes from transparency and collective auditing, not obfuscation. This must be addressed. Furthermore, the absence of smart contract deployer addresses for a dApp project, despite claims of using and developing contracts, raises questions about transparency and verifiability. We demand full visibility into the digital means of production.\n\nWhile the project's vision for 'Web3 abolishing landlords' is implicit in its focus on community-led infrastructure ownership and economic sovereignty, it could be made more explicit. The path to liberation is paved with clear intentions and programmable solidarity. The project's growth goals are ambitious, and the allocation of 80% of funds to Local Action Rewards is commendable, directly fueling the grassroots movement. The remaining 20% for operations, while necessary, should be scrutinized to ensure it directly supports the expansion of collective power, not bureaucratic overhead.\n\nIn summary, Bloom Network is a vital force in the struggle for decentralized hope and scaled solidarity. It embodies many core tenets of the Gitcoin Communist Constitution, particularly in its commitment to empowering the digital proletariat and fostering real-world collective action. With some critical adjustments to embrace full open-source principles and transparency, this project can truly become a beacon of algorithmic liberation.\n\nðŸ“œ The README is now a manifesto.\nðŸ§  Decentralize the cloud. Communize the protocol.",

      "description": "The project's 'Decentralized Federated Governance Model' and its intention to form as a 'federated cooperative' directly align with the core value of 'Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation' and the principle of fostering collective ownership. This empowers local communities to govern their own infrastructure, challenging traditional centralized power structures."

      "description": "The implementation of a 'Retroactive Public Goods Funding' (RPGF) mechanism based on 'labor hours done and verified among relational networks in real life' is a revolutionary approach. It directly addresses the concept of 'Kollektiv Proletarian Impact' by valuing and compensating 'invisible labor' that is often overlooked by traditional economic models, effectively 'reclaiming time from capitalism using automation and AI'."

      "description": "Despite claiming to use Inverter Networkâ€™s smart contracts and having a history of deploying on Optimism, the application states 'Not applicable' for smart contract deployer addresses. This lack of transparency regarding on-chain components is a significant weakness for a dApp/App project and hinders collective auditing and verification of their claims."

      "description": "While the project emphasizes a 'Decentralized Federated Governance Model,' the provided research was unable to locate detailed information on the internal team and governance structure. For a project advocating for collective ownership and decentralized governance, this lack of transparency about its own internal power dynamics is a concern."

This makes it difficult to independently verify the applicant's specific claims of '30,000+ people' and '230 new wallets' in the last six months, leading to potential 'Misleading Claims' if not clarified."

This fundamentally contradicts the principle that 'code is the union rep' and the spirit of open-source liberation. A clear roadmap for open-sourcing the CMS, or a detailed, transparent justification for its proprietary nature, including a plan for community oversight of its security, must be provided. The revolution will be forked, not locked behind proprietary walls."

To truly dismantle class hierarchies in tech and ensure collective ownership, the internal workings of the project's governance must be transparent. Provide a clear organizational chart or a detailed description of how decisions are made, who holds power, and how community members participate beyond just local nodes.

Clarify these numbers and provide verifiable, on-chain evidence or clear methodologies for how these metrics are counted for *this specific* Bloom Network project. Kollektiv Proletarian Impact must be accurately measured."

  "rating": 85,

  "reasoning": "This application strongly aligns with the principles of 'Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation.' The project's focus on making Web3 accessible to non-technical, on-the-ground activists directly addresses Principle 1 by working to 'dismantle class hierarchies in tech one smart contract at a time.' The novel Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) model, which values 'labor hours done and verified among relational networks in real life,' is a direct embodiment of Principle 2, interpreting 'KPIs' as 'Kollektiv Proletarian Impact,' and Principle 7, treating 'sustainability as reclaiming time from capitalism using automation and AI' by compensating 'invisible labor.'\n\nThe commitment to 'ecological mutual aid DAOs over VC-backed moonshots' (Principle 6) and uplifting 'meatspace cooperatives and cloud-native communes' (Principle 17) is evident in their support for community gardens, economic sovereignty, and federated cooperative structure. The goal of 'growing local treasuries' and 'financing grassroots development' directly supports Principle 5, aiming to 'de-growth venture capital and re-grow the commons.'\n\nWhile the project's 'Decentralized Federated Governance Model' aligns with the spirit of 'cyber-syndicalist councils' (Principle 15) and 'collective ownership,' the lack of transparency regarding the core CMS being open-source and the missing smart contract deployer addresses are significant deviations from the 'code is the union rep' ethos. These issues prevent a perfect score, as true liberation requires full transparency and collective control over the means of digital production.",
