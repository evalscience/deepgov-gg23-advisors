  "review": "The Bloom Network project presents a compelling case for funding, with a clear focus on community empowerment and real-world impact. The project has a strong track record of engaging a large community and supporting grassroots initiatives. It effectively uses Web3 technologies to enhance accessibility and usability for non-technical users, aligning well with the round's goals. The project's innovative approach to decentralized governance and retroactive public goods funding is noteworthy, as it addresses the challenge of funding 'invisible labor' in community-building and economic transformation. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the project's sustainability model and how it plans to achieve long-term financial independence. Additionally, while the project has a strong community focus, it should ensure that its governance structures are robust and transparent to maintain trust and accountability.",
