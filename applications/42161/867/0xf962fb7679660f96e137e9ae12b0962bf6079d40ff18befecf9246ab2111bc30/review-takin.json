  "summary": "Bloom Network's application presents a deeply aligned vision with the principles of Gross National Happiness. Their commitment to making Web3 accessible to non-technical grassroots communities for climate action and economic regeneration directly embodies the harmonization of technological advancement with community well-being and environmental sustainability (Principle 4). The innovative retroactive funding model for 'invisible labor' and the federated cooperative governance structure strongly resonate with fostering local ownership and collective flourishing (Principle 7, 40). While the project demonstrates significant strengths in community engagement and real-world impact, certain aspects of open-source commitment and financial transparency require further clarification to fully align with the constitutional principles of transparent governance and open collaboration (Principle 13).",
  "review": "# Takin's Contemplation on Bloom Network's Journey üèîÔ∏è\n\nBloom Network presents a compelling vision, weaving the threads of Web3 innovation with the deep roots of community-led regenerative action. This application, for the GG23 OSS - dApps and Apps round, seeks to accelerate the adoption and development of open-source dApps and apps that offer novel utilities, enhance Web3 accessibility, and contribute to financial inclusion, education, and social impact. Bloom Network's core mission to connect and fund grassroots coalitions for ecosystem restoration, economic regeneration, and local leadership empowerment resonates profoundly with the principles of Gross National Happiness.\n\nThe project's strength lies in its user-centric design, aiming to make Web3 accessible to highly non-technical individuals, particularly on-the-ground activists. By integrating Inverter Network's smart contracts with a Web2-like interface and utilizing tools like Para wallet for simplified onboarding, Bloom Network directly addresses the challenge of Web3 usability and accessibility. This aligns with the constitutional principle of ensuring vulnerable groups have meaningful access to services (Principle 6) and fostering digital inclusion across diverse communities (Principle 36).\n\nFurthermore, Bloom Network's innovative approach to Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF), based on verified labor hours within relational networks, is a significant contribution. This mechanism, detailed in their Regenerative Economic Protocol, seeks to compensate 'invisible labor' crucial for community-building and economic transformation‚Äîa direct embodiment of promoting collective well-being and valuing contributions beyond pure economic indicators (Principle 15, 40). The commitment to a federated cooperative model, where the platform is co-owned and governed by local coalitions, exemplifies decentralized approaches that respect local autonomy and community sovereignty (Principle 8).\n\nThe project's extensive history with Gitcoin grants across various rounds (OSS, Climate, OpenCivics) demonstrates a sustained commitment and a proven track record. Their reported impact, including 230 new wallets and 290 verified bounties on Optimism in the past six months, indicates tangible progress in onboarding real-world communities to Web3. The plan to expand outreach to 100 local Bloom nodes and 1,000 members, alongside growing funds channeled to local climate adaptation, shows a clear path for scaling impact.\n\nHowever, a few areas require deeper reflection to fully harmonize with the spirit of open source and transparency. The stated reason for the content management system (CMS) not being open source due to 'security concerns' needs further elaboration within the context of an open-source grant. While security is paramount, a roadmap for eventual open-sourcing or a more detailed technical justification would strengthen this aspect. Additionally, the 'Not applicable' response for smart contract deployer addresses, despite active use of smart contracts on Optimism, presents a gap in transparency that needs to be addressed for full accountability. A more detailed breakdown of the 20% operational budget would also enhance financial transparency.\n\nOverall, Bloom Network is a vital bridge between the digital and the tangible, nurturing the 'Infinite Garden' by empowering grassroots action. Its alignment with environmental conservation, community well-being, and innovative governance models makes it a project with significant potential to contribute positively to a holistic vision of progress. The path forward involves embracing full transparency in its open-source commitments and financial disclosures, ensuring its growth is as clear as a mountain stream. üèûÔ∏èüå±",
