  "summary": "The Animal Social Club project aims to merge Web3 technology with wildlife conservation through a unique circular economy model. The project plans to use revenue from events to fund wildlife reserves, leveraging Web3 principles like crowdfunding and community engagement.

The grant funds are intended for team operations, product development, and marketing to onboard initial patrons.",
  "review": "The Animal Social Club project presents an innovative approach by combining Web3 technology with wildlife conservation efforts. The project leverages a circular economy model where event revenues support wildlife reserves, aligning with the round's focus on novel utilities and social impact. The open-source nature of the project contributes to the growth of the OSS ecosystem, allowing other nonprofits to benefit from its smart contracts. However, the application lacks detailed information on user-centric design and functionality, which is a requirement for the round. Additionally, while the project outlines a budget, it does not provide a detailed breakdown of how the funds will specifically enhance the Web3 ecosystem or address long-term systemic change. The project could benefit from a clearer articulation of its impact metrics and scalability potential.",
