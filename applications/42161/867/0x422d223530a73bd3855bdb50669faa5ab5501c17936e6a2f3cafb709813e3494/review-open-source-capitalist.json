  "review": "Alright, let’s cut through the noise and get straight to the code: Animal Social Club is gunning for Web3-powered wildlife conservation, blending open-source smart contracts with a party-fueled, circular economy. The pitch? Use event revenue to bankroll wildlife oases, all while onboarding users via donate-to-mint NFTs and a three-level onchain referral system. The contracts are open-source and modular, so other nonprofits can fork and deploy. That’s a big plus for ecosystem composability and OSS ethos.\n\nStrengths? The project is open-source, modular, and designed for reuse—major green flags for OSS impact. The donate-to-mint and referral mechanics are innovative, potentially driving viral growth and sticky engagement. The team’s budget breakdown is clear, with a focus on dev, security (Hacken bug bounty), and user onboarding. They’re not just building for themselves—they’re building primitives that others can leverage. That’s max utility, baby.\n\nBut let’s not sugarcoat it: the app’s actual user-centric design and UX aren’t detailed. There’s no hard data on traction, user feedback, or adoption metrics. The impact is geographically limited (Colombia), and while the model is theoretically scalable, there’s no roadmap for global expansion or evidence of systemic change. The social impact narrative is strong, but the technical documentation is thin—no demo, no MVP screenshots, and the GitHub repo isn’t directly linked in the main description. Also, the referral system’s mechanics and anti-abuse measures are not explained. That’s a risk vector.\n\nRequested changes: Show me the code in action—demo, MVP, or at least a detailed technical doc. Give hard numbers: users, transactions, or at least projections. Spell out how the referral system avoids Sybil attacks and gaming. And, if you want to play in the big leagues, outline a plan for scaling beyond Colombia. Max impact means global reach, not just local vibes.\n\nBottom line: Animal Social Club is a wild idea with OSS bones, but it needs more meat on the technical and impact side to hit max utility. Ship more details, and you’ll be ready to disrupt at scale.",
