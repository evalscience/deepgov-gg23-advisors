  "summary": "This project, \"Animal Social Club,\" attempts to blend wildlife conservation with Web3. While its open-source contracts hint at collective potential, the proposed \"Donate-to-Mint membership (on KYC condition)\" and \"Three-Level Onchain Referral System\" fundamentally betray the spirit of **Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation**. The revolution will not be KYC'd, comrades. This application presents a clear ideological struggle between genuine public good and the insidious tendrils of hierarchical, permissioned structures.",
  "review": "The Animal Social Club presents a fascinating, albeit ideologically conflicted, proposition. On one hand, the commitment to open-source, modular smart contracts for \"empowering a broader ecosystem of impact-driven projects\" is a beacon of collective ownership. This is where code truly acts as the union rep, offering tools for the digital proletariat to build their own commons. The vision of \"natural reserves (oases)\" aligns with our call to **de-growth venture capital and re-grow the commons**, prioritizing *ecological mutual aid DAOs over VC-backed moonshots*. This is the kind of meatspace cooperative uplift we seek.\n\nHowever, the proposed implementation reveals significant bourgeois tendencies. The \"Donate-to-Mint membership (on KYC condition)\" is a direct affront to **Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation**. KYC is a gatekeeper, a digital landlord demanding permission where none should be required. It reinforces existing power hierarchies, creating a class system within the very act of participation. The \"Three-Level Onchain Referral System\" further exacerbates this. While framed as community growth, such multi-tiered structures often lead to exploitative dynamics, directly contradicting our principle to *dismantle class hierarchies in tech one smart contract at a time*. This is not *Kollektiv Proletarian Impact*; it's a pyramid scheme in digital disguise.\n\nFurthermore, the budget allocation raises concerns. A significant portion ($13k for \"team operations that brought us to this point today\" and $10k for \"project management, marketing, and sales\") suggests a focus on traditional, capitalistic growth metrics rather than pure public goods development or *algorithmic redistribution of wealth*. We seek projects that reclaim time from capitalism using automation and AI, not those that funnel funds into marketing campaigns to onboard \"patrons.\" The revolution will not be sold, it will be built by the people, for the people.",

  "reasoning": "This decision is heavily influenced by the core tenets of Ultra-Grant: The Gitcoin Communist v2.0 constitution.\n\n*   **Core Value Framework**: The \"Donate-to-Mint membership (on KYC condition)\" directly violates \"Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation.\" The revolution demands permissionless access.\n*   **Evidence and Measurement Principles**: The \"Three-Level Onchain Referral System\" fails to \"dismantle class hierarchies in tech one smart contract at a time\" and instead risks creating new ones.
