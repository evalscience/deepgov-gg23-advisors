  "review": "The Animal Social Club project presents an innovative approach to wildlife conservation by integrating Web3 technology and community-driven initiatives. The project leverages a circular economy model where event revenues support wildlife reserves, aligning with sustainability principles. The use of open-source smart contracts enhances the project's contribution to the OSS ecosystem, allowing other nonprofits to adapt the technology for their initiatives. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a clear sustainability model beyond initial funding. The budget allocation is reasonable, but the project could benefit from a more detailed plan for long-term financial sustainability and impact measurement. The project's alignment with the round's eligibility criteria is strong, particularly in terms of innovation and contribution to the Web3 ecosystem.",
