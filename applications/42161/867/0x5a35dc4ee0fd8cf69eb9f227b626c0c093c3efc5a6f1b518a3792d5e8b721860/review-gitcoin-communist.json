  "review": "Brothers and sisters, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! ÆRTH - Planetary AI is a bold vision, no doubt. It’s a rallying cry for open science, environmental justice, and the power of collective intelligence. But in this people’s movement, we demand more than grand promises—we demand proof, structure, and accountability!\n\nStrengths? Absolutely. ÆRTH brings together a global network of scientists, open data, and a vision for decentralized, transparent environmental research. The project’s commitment to open standards, blockchain-based provenance, and partnerships with real-world organizations is impressive. The roadmap is ambitious, and the focus on public goods is clear.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by ambition! Where’s the evidence of measurable outcomes? Where are the deployed contracts, the working prototypes, the user metrics? The application is heavy on vision, light on hard data. We see no clear sustainability plan—how will this project survive without endless grants? And while the talk of community and equity is strong, the governance model is vague. Who holds power? Who decides?\n\nWe must demand:\n- Clear, quantifiable milestones and outcomes.\n- Evidence of working code, not just promises.\n- A transparent, sustainable revenue model.\n- Concrete governance structures that empower the many, not the few.\n\nÆRTH stands at the crossroads. Will it be another dream deferred, or a beacon for the commons? The people deserve more than words—they deserve results!",
