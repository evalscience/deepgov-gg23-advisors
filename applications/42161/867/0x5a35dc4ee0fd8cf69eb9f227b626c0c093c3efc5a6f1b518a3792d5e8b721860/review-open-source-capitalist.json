  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. ÆRTH - Planetary AI is swinging for the fences: open-source, decentralized, and aiming to be the Kaggle of environmental science, but with blockchain sauce. The vision? Unify fragmented environmental data, empower global researchers, and build a platform that could scale to planetary impact. That's max utility thinking—right in my wheelhouse.\n\nStrengths? The project is laser-focused on systemic change, not just patching up local issues. We're talking about infrastructure for global data standards, distributed compute, and open AI model sharing. The roadmap is ambitious, with clear phases and a plan to scale from a single digital twin to a global ecosystem. Partnerships with major ocean and soil orgs? That's serious network effect potential. The open-source ethos is strong, and the GitHub is public—transparency check.\n\nBut let's not get lost in the hype. Weaknesses? The project is still pre-product—no smart contracts deployed, and both DApps are in development. That's a big risk. The application is heavy on vision, light on concrete user-centric design details or current traction. The differentiation is there, but the execution risk is high. Also, the grant ask is for a 'financial bridge'—not a full build. That means the impact is contingent on future fundraising, not guaranteed by this round alone.\n\nRequested changes: I want to see a sharper focus on user-centric design—mockups, user flows, or early feedback from actual scientists. Show me a concrete MVP timeline and milestones for the next 3-6 months. And let's get at least one smart contract on testnet before the next round. If you want to disrupt, you gotta ship.",
