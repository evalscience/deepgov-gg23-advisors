  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the code: ÆRTH is swinging for the fences with a global, open-source, blockchain-powered platform for environmental data and AI modeling. The vision? Massive—think Kaggle meets Hugging Face, but for planetary science, all running on decentralized rails. The pitch is dripping with ambition: unified data standards, distributed compute, tokenized incentives, and a who’s-who of ocean science partners. If they pull it off, it’s a moonshot for open science and Web3 utility.\n\nBut let’s debug the stack: The project is still in pre-product—no smart contracts deployed, no live dApps, and the roadmap is a multi-phase, multi-million dollar odyssey. The grant ask is for a “financial bridge” to get to bigger capital, not to ship a working MVP. There’s a lot of talk about standards, ontologies, and token economies, but not enough about concrete user flows, UX, or how the first users will actually interact with the system. The GitHub is public, but there’s no evidence of shipped code or active repos for the dApps described. That’s a red flag for OSS rounds.\n\nOn the plus side, the project is open source, user-centric (in theory), and aims for systemic, global impact—right in the sweet spot for max utility. The partnerships are impressive, and the vision is pure open-source capitalist: build infra, scale globally, disrupt the old guard. But the lack of shipped product, unclear short-term deliverables, and heavy reliance on future funding make this a high-risk, high-reward play. If you want to maximize impact, you need to see code, not just whitepapers.\n\nBottom line: killer vision, but needs to show more build-in-public hustle and ship something tangible before it’s ready for prime time funding. Score reflects both the massive upside and the current execution gap.",
