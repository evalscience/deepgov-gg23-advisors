Our platform provides a collaborative space where researchers can develop and share open-source algorithms for processing complex environmental datasets.\n\nWe're creating open standards for environmental data interchange, which can be adopted and built upon by the wider scientific community. Additionally, ÆRTH is developing open-source libraries for blockchain-based data provenance tracking and decentralized computation, which can be utilized in other scientific fields beyond environmental research.\n\nBy making these tools and standards freely available, ÆRTH expands the OSS ecosystem, enabling more researchers and developers to contribute to and benefit from cutting-edge environmental science technologies.",

By distributing control and eliminating central authorities, they enhance data sovereignty, reduce single points of failure, and foster a more collaborative, open scientific ecosystem.\n                        \nData Provider DApp (Internal): This DApp serves as a secure, decentralised platform for data providers within the ÆRTH cooperative. It implements blockchain-based data provenance tracking, ensuring transparent ownership and usage of environmental data streams. Key features include:\n\n* Geospatial mapping of data contributions\n* IP and ownership management using smart contracts\n* Timestamp and geo-tagging of data streams\n* Peer-to-peer data sharing requests and approvals\n* Usage analytics for data utilization\n\nThe decentralized nature of this DApp ensures that data ownership remains with the providers, while enabling secure, permissioned sharing within the network.\n\nPublic-Facing Model Deployment DApp: This DApp, inspired by Hugging Face, allows cooperative members to publish pre-trained environmental models and enables third parties to fine-tune and deploy these models. Key features include:\n\n* Decentralized model repository\n\n* On-chain model versioning and provenance tracking\n\n* Distributed computation for model training and inference\n\n* Token-based incentives for model sharing and improvement\n\n* Smart contract-governed access control for sensitive models\n\nThe decentralized architecture of this DApp ensures fair attribution, resistant hosting, and community-driven model development.\n\n",

We will allocate funds to:\n\n* Implement blockchain-based data provenance tracking\n\n* Develop geospatial mapping functionality for data contributions\n\n* Create smart contracts for IP and ownership management\n\n* Build a system for timestamp and geo-tagging of data streams\n\n* Design a peer-to-peer data sharing request and approval mechanism\n\n* Develop usage analytics for data utilization\n\n* Public-Facing Model Deployment DApp: This platform will enable cooperative members to publish and share environmental models. Funding will be used to:\n\n* Create a decentralized model repository\n\n* Implement on-chain model versioning and provenance tracking\n\n* Develop distributed computation capabilities for model training and inference\n\n* Design a token-based incentive system for model sharing and improvement\n\n* Implement smart contract-governed access control for sensitive models\n\nThe grant will cover a portion of the essential development costs, including:\n\n* Hiring skilled blockchain and full-stack developers\n\n* Conducting security audits for smart contracts\n\n* Deploying and testing on testnet environments\n\n* Creating user interfaces for both DApps\n\n* Developing documentation and APIs for integration\n\nBy focusing on these core components, we aim to create a robust, decentralized foundation for environmental data sharing and model deployment within the allocated budget.\n",

        "description": "# ÆRTH - A Global Environmental Science Data & Standards Cooperative\n\nWe are a pioneering DeSci network uniting Earth Observation scientists from NASA JPL, to global Ocean Science Institutions on 7 coasts, Marine Biologists, Soil Scientists, and Satellite integration experts. \n\n[ÆRTH](https://www.aerth.live/) is developing an open source, distributed environmental data set, unifying on the ground research streams with satellite observation streams. Our science network is building multi modal data integration and shared computational resources to better model solutions for climate adaptation, biodiversity and regeneration strategies.\n\n*Let’s Defeat Moloch!* Today we face the global coordination failure of protecting our life support systems. The planet is one interconnected environmental system, yet our data models are not. This systemic issue has led to a waste of investment into ineffective solutions and a mystified \"sustainable\" asset class that poorly represents the realities of our Earth (Carbon, Biodiversity, SDG;s etc).\n\nWe are creating unified, agreed upon tools and standards to facilitate coordination. This infrastructure empowers the development of advanced predictive environmental models that can compute the complexity of our natural systems. \n\n## ÆRTH is the Kaggle for environmental science, reimagined with blockchain technology.\n\nBlockchain enables secure data sharing with clear ownership tracking and usage metrics. This unified standard allows global researchers and ML scientists to compute over previously siloed data, building advanced models through competitions.
