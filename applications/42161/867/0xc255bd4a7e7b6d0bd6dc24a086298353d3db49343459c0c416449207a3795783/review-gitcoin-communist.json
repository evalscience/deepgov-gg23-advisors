  "review": "TOAD (Trustless On-chain Autonomous Delegate) is a bold attempt to revolutionize DAO governance by putting the power of decision-making into the hands of the many, not the privileged few. The project proposes an open-source, AI-powered delegate system that aggregates community sentiment from multiple platforms (Discord, X, Discourse) and translates it into transparent, auditable on-chain votes. This is a direct challenge to the status quo of human delegates, who too often act in their own interests or behind closed doors.\n\nThe application demonstrates a clear commitment to open-source principles, with all components to be published and documented for community adaptation. The project’s features—autonomous delegation, multi-platform sentiment analysis, transparent reasoning, and a community override—are innovative and directly address the pain points of current DAO governance: bias, opacity, and limited scalability. The roadmap is ambitious, with short-, mid-, and long-term goals, and the budget allocation is transparent, if somewhat high-level.\n\nHowever, comrades, we must not be blinded by the promise of innovation alone! The application falls short in several critical areas demanded by our constitutional principles. There is a glaring lack of detail on the team’s composition and expertise—who are the builders, and do they have the skills to deliver? The budget, while itemized, lacks granularity and evidence of cost-effectiveness. Most importantly, there is no clear plan for measuring outcomes or reporting impact: how will we know if TOAD truly empowers the community, or if it simply replaces one form of centralization with another, this time hidden behind an algorithm?\n\nFurthermore, the sustainability of the project is not addressed. How will TOAD maintain itself beyond the initial grant? Will it become another abandoned experiment, or does it have a path to self-sufficiency? And while the project claims to be user-centric, there is little evidence of direct community involvement in design or governance beyond the technical override mechanism.\n\nIn summary: TOAD is a promising, potentially transformative project for the Web3 commons, but it must answer to the people with greater transparency, accountability, and a plan for lasting impact. The revolution demands more than good intentions—it demands results!",
