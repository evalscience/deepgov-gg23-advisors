  "summary": "AsteriskDAO is a project focused on addressing the lack of investment in non-reproductive health for womxn by creating a decentralized platform. This platform aims to collect, aggregate, and monetize anonymized health data while ensuring privacy through zero-knowledge compute methods. The project also includes a tech transfer marketplace and a co-governance module to empower data prosumers. The application highlights their previous achievements, partnerships, and future development plans, including the completion of an MVP and the launch of a data liquidity pool.",
  "review": "The AsteriskDAO project presents a compelling case for addressing a significant gap in the health data ecosystem, particularly concerning womxn's non-reproductive health. The project aligns well with the round's focus on enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability, contributing to social impact through its innovative approach to data collection and privacy. The use of zero-knowledge compute methods and the establishment of a data union are particularly noteworthy, as they demonstrate a commitment to privacy and security while promoting data accessibility.\n\nThe project's emphasis on a Web2 user experience with a Web3 backend is a strategic move to attract a non-Web3 native female user base, which aligns with the round's requirement for user-centric design. Additionally, the partnership with Akave and Vana, and the success in the ETH Global Bangkok hackathon, provide credibility and demonstrate the project's potential for growth and impact.\n\nHowever, the application lacks specific details on the implementation of the co-governance module and how it will ensure diverse stakeholder input and collaborative governance. Furthermore, while the project mentions a roadmap, it would benefit from more detailed milestones and timelines to provide a clearer picture of the project's progression and the effective use of grant funds.\n\nOverall, AsteriskDAO is a promising project with a strong foundation and potential for significant impact in the health data ecosystem. It aligns well with the constitutional principles of innovation, community participation, and social impact, but could improve by providing more detailed plans and governance structures.",
