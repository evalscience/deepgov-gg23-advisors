  "summary": "AsteriskDAO is a project focused on addressing the lack of investment in non-reproductive health data for womxn by creating a decentralized platform. This platform includes a data union for collecting and monetizing anonymized health data, a tech transfer marketplace, and a co-governance module. The project aims to enhance the OSS ecosystem by providing more accessible health data while ensuring privacy and security. The grant will be used to develop their MVP and further their roadmap, which includes launching a data liquidity pool and building a customer portal.",
  "review": "AsteriskDAO presents a compelling case for addressing a significant gap in health data for womxn, which aligns with the round's focus on social impact and innovation in the Web3 ecosystem. The project demonstrates a user-centric design by targeting a non-Web3 native female user base and ensuring data privacy and security. The partnership with Akave and Vana for data liquidity pools is a notable strength, showcasing collaboration and potential for ecosystem growth. However, the application lacks detailed information on the project's sustainability model and specific measurable outcomes, which are crucial for long-term success and alignment with the constitutional principles. Additionally, the absence of a public group chat link and deployer addresses raises concerns about transparency and community engagement.",
