  "summary": "AsteriskDAO is a project focused on addressing the lack of investment in non-reproductive health data for womxn by creating a decentralized platform. This platform includes a data union for collecting and monetizing health data, a tech transfer marketplace, and a co-governance module. The project aims to enhance the OSS ecosystem by providing more accessible health data while ensuring privacy and security. The grant will be used to develop their MVP and further their roadmap, which includes launching a beta version and developing APIs for clinician access.",
  "review": "AsteriskDAO presents a compelling case for addressing a significant gap in health data for womxn, which aligns with the round's focus on social impact and innovation in the Web3 ecosystem. The project demonstrates a user-centric design by targeting a non-Web3 native female user base and ensuring data privacy and security. The partnership with Akave and Vana for data liquidity pools is a notable strength, enhancing the project's credibility and potential impact. However, the application lacks detailed information on the project's current stage of development and specific metrics for success. Additionally, the absence of a public group chat link and deployer addresses raises concerns about transparency and readiness for deployment. The project could benefit from a clearer articulation of its long-term impact and scalability potential, as well as more detailed plans for the use of grant funds.",
