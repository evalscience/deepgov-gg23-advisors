By leveraging programmable money, Flow State enables ongoing funding streams, allowing projects to receive consistent support and fostering long-term relationships between donors and grantees. ([docs.flowstate.network](https://docs.flowstate.network/?utm_source=openai))\n\nA key feature of Flow State is its implementation of Streaming Quadratic Funding (SQF). Unlike traditional quadratic funding, which operates in discrete rounds, SQF utilizes continuous donation streams and real-time quadratic matching to dynamically allocate funds. This approach enhances capital efficiency, accelerates the velocity of public goods funding, and provides more consistent support for grantees. ([docs.geoweb.network](https://docs.geoweb.network/concepts/streaming-quadratic-funding/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn early 2024, Flow State, in partnership with Gitcoin and Superfluid, conducted the first-ever SQF pilot round from February 21 to April 21, 2024. This pilot aimed to test the effectiveness of SQF in real-world scenarios, demonstrating its potential to revolutionize public goods funding by providing continuous and sustainable support. ([mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz/geoweb.eth/54RLkPhmWIcWP4B8QFlYbVY_M-fxaNqjqZF-5pe3WdI?utm_source=openai))\n\nFor developers interested in contributing to the SQF project, Flow State has made its codebase publicly available on GitHub. The repository includes comprehensive documentation and guidelines for setting up the local environment, installing dependencies, and running the project. ([github.com](https://github.com/flow-state-coop/streaming-quadratic-funding?utm_source=openai))\n\nFlow State operates as a Colorado Limited Cooperative, ensuring democratic governance and transparent distribution of funds. This structure aligns with Flow State's mission to create a sustainable and equitable ecosystem for public goods funding.
