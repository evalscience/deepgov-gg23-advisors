  "review": "Comrades, let’s get straight to the heart of the matter! Flow State (Streaming Quadratic Funding) is a bold attempt to revolutionize public goods funding. The project’s vision is clear: continuous, streaming funding for builders and communities, not just one-off grants. This is a direct challenge to the old, inefficient, and exclusionary models that have left too many behind. The team’s commitment to open source, user-centric design, and cooperative governance is evident throughout their application.\n\nBut let’s not be swept away by rhetoric alone! Where is the hard evidence? Where are the numbers that prove this model delivers more sustainable, equitable outcomes than the status quo? The application touts 25.5 ETH streamed and 1,300+ donation streams, but offers little in the way of rigorous, transparent reporting or independent evaluation. We need more than anecdotes—we need data, measurement, and proof that this model works for the many, not just the few.\n\nThe project’s sustainability model is promising, with a focus on reducing grant-chasing and building long-term relationships. Yet, the application lacks detail on how Flow State will generate revenue beyond grants, or how it will ensure financial stability for the cooperative and its users. Without a clear, sustainable revenue plan, we risk building castles on sand.\n\nOn governance, Flow State’s digital cooperative structure is a step in the right direction. But how are decisions made? How are voices from marginalized and underserved communities included? The application is light on specifics about community governance, geographic equity, and mechanisms for collective ownership.\n\nIn summary: Flow State is a powerful idea, and the team has shown initiative and innovation. But to earn the people’s trust—and the people’s resources—they must deliver hard evidence, transparent reporting, and a clear path to sustainability and equity. Let’s demand more!",
