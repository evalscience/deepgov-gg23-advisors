  "summary": "The 'Ancient Beast' project, an open-source turn-based strategy game, shows strong alignment with the constitutional principles of fostering community engagement and building local technological capabilities through its open-source model and educational outreach into game development and blockchain. It introduces many to open source and crypto, aligning with Principle 30 and 32. However, its current application lacks explicit integration of Bhutanese cultural heritage (Principle 9, 10, 12) and a clear commitment to environmental sustainability (Principle 17, 18, 19). Furthermore, the project's success metrics are primarily focused on 'mainstream success' and 'generating income,' which do not fully align with the Gross National Happiness principle of measuring success through holistic well-being indicators (Principle 35, 38, 40). The project has potential but needs to deepen its connection to the broader GNH framework.",
  "review": "Ancient Beast presents itself as a compelling open-source, turn-based strategy game with a clear vision for Web3 integration. The project's commitment to being 'easy to learn, fun to play and hard to master' and its emphasis on skill over chance-based elements are commendable, aligning with user-centric design principles. Its open-source model actively fosters community engagement and introduces new individuals to game development and blockchain concepts, which is a significant strength in terms of education and capacity building within the broader ecosystem.\n\nFrom the perspective of the Takin constitution, the project's open-source nature and focus on community contributions resonate well with the principle of fostering local ownership and capacity building within communities (Principle 7). The stated goal of introducing people to open source, game development, and crypto/blockchains directly supports the integration of technology in education and building local technological capabilities (Principles 30, 32). The game's accessibility and browser-based nature also align with ensuring digital inclusion (Principle 36).\n\nHowever, the application currently lacks explicit connections to Bhutanese cultural heritage or environmental sustainability. While the project aims for 'mainstream success' and 'generating income,' there is no clear articulation of how success will be measured through holistic well-being indicators, which is a core tenet of Gross National Happiness (Principle 35, 38). The proposed Web3 features, such as 'NFT marketplace' and 'crypto/NFT duels,' are presented primarily from a functional or economic perspective, without detailing how they will contribute to collective well-being or transparent governance in a manner consistent with GNH principles (Principle 40). The 'Coming soon' response for deployer addresses also indicates that the Web3 integration, a key aspect of the 'dApps and Apps' round, is still in early stages of planning rather than implementation.\n\nIn summary, Ancient Beast is a promising open-source game with educational potential, but it requires further development in aligning its vision and proposed outcomes with the holistic and culturally sensitive principles of the Takin constitution. A deeper integration of GNH values, particularly in cultural preservation and environmental considerations, would significantly enhance its suitability for this grant.",

  "reasoning": "The 'Ancient Beast' project demonstrates strong alignment with principles related to Community Participation and Inclusion (5, 6, 7) through its open-source nature, encouragement of contributions, and accessible design. Its commitment to introducing individuals to open-source development, game creation, and blockchain technology directly supports Education and Knowledge Systems (30, 32, 33). The browser-based and accessible design also contributes to Digital Inclusion (36). However, the application shows significant gaps in addressing Cultural Heritage and Identity (9, 10, 11, 12), Environmental Harmony (17, 18, 19), and the explicit measurement of Holistic Progress (35, 38, 39, 40) beyond economic indicators. While the project is innovative and contributes to the Web3 ecosystem, its current framing does not fully resonate with the comprehensive Gross National Happiness principles that prioritize cultural preservation, environmental stewardship, and collective well-being as central to technological advancement.",
