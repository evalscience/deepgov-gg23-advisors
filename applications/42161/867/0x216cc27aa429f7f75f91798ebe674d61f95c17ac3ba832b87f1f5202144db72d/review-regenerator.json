  "summary": "The Ancient Beast project is a turn-based strategy game that aims to introduce players to open source, game development, and blockchain technology. The project is free and open source, offering a unique gaming experience without chance-based elements. It seeks funding to overcome current development bottlenecks, such as implementing online multiplayer, AI practice bots, and animations. The project aligns with the round's goals by contributing to the growth of the OSS ecosystem and enhancing Web3 accessibility.",
  "review": "The Ancient Beast project presents a compelling case for funding within the GG23 OSS - dApps and Apps round. It aligns well with the round's objectives by promoting open source principles and contributing to the Web3 ecosystem. The project is innovative in its approach to gaming, offering a strategy game without chance-based elements, which is a unique selling point. However, the application lacks detailed information on how the grant funds will be specifically allocated to address the bottlenecks mentioned. Additionally, while the project has a clear vision for future development, it would benefit from a more structured plan with timelines and milestones. The project's contribution to the OSS ecosystem is significant, as it introduces new users to open source and blockchain technologies. However, the application could be strengthened by providing more concrete examples of its impact on the community and ecosystem.",
