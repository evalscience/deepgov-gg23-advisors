  "summary": "The Ancient Beast project is a turn-based strategy video game that aims to introduce players to open source, game development, and blockchain technology. The project is free, open-source, and browser-based, offering 1vs1 or 2vs2 matches. It seeks funding to overcome current bottlenecks, such as implementing online multiplayer, AI practice bots, and animations for characters. The project also plans to integrate Web3 features like wallet integration and an NFT marketplace. The application highlights its contribution to the OSS ecosystem by introducing new users to open source and blockchain technologies.",
  "review": "The Ancient Beast project presents a compelling case for funding, emphasizing its role in introducing users to open source and blockchain technologies. The project is aligned with the round's goals of enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a sustainable revenue model, which are critical according to the model specification. The project is still in progress, with several key features yet to be implemented, which raises concerns about its current impact and sustainability. The application could benefit from a more structured plan for achieving its goals and demonstrating its contribution to the Web3 ecosystem.",
