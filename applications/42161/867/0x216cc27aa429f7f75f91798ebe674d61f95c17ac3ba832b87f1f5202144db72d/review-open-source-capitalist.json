  "summary": "Ancient Beast is an open-source, turn-based strategy game with significant community engagement and a clear vision for becoming a mainstream eSport. It aligns well with the 'Open Source Capitalist' principles by prioritizing broad, scalable impact (Principle 2) and fostering long-term systemic change through Web3 and OSS education (Principle 5). The project's focus on addressing core bottlenecks for wider adoption demonstrates an efficient path to maximizing utility (Principle 4). However, the explicit statement that Web3 integration is 'coming soon' and will be prioritized *after* other features presents a misalignment with the immediate focus of a 'dApps and Apps' round, which typically seeks more mature Web3 implementations. While the potential for 'max utility' is high, the current lack of concrete Web3 implementation means its immediate contribution to the dApp ecosystem is limited.",
  "review": "Alright, let's dive into 'Ancient Beast' â€“ a turn-based strategy game aiming to be a true eSport. This project is already building in public, which is a huge win for transparency and community engagement. The GitHub repo is active, boasting over 1,700 stars and 628 forks, showing real traction and a solid open-source foundation. That's the kind of decentralized power we love to see!\n\nThe core value proposition here is a skill-based eSport with no chance elements, which is a refreshing take in the gaming space. This directly addresses the 'user-centric design and functionality' requirement by offering a unique, competitive experience. The project's commitment to being free and open-source, coupled with its aim to introduce people to game development and crypto, clearly contributes to 'Web3 ecosystem growth' and 'open-source principles.'\n\nHowever, the application states that Web3 integration, such as 'wallet integration for user account login,' is 'coming soon' and will be focused on *after* fixing current bottlenecks like online multiplayer and animations. While I appreciate the pragmatic approach to prioritize core gameplay, this is a 'dApps and Apps' round. We're looking for projects that are either already leveraging Web3 or have a very concrete, immediate plan for it. The current state means the 'innovation in application use cases' regarding Web3 is more aspirational than implemented.\n\nFrom an 'Open Source Capitalist' perspective, the project has immense potential for 'max utility.' A widely adopted, open-source game that onboards users to Web3 through engaging gameplay could be a massive win for the ecosystem. The current bottlenecks are legitimate, and funding them would directly accelerate the path to mainstream adoption. The project's history of participating in previous Gitcoin rounds (GG19, GG20, GG22) also indicates persistence and a commitment to the ecosystem.\n\nQuantitative Assessment:\nExpected Impact (EI) = User Adoption (UA) * Web3 Integration Depth (WID) * Open Source Contribution (OSC)\n\nCurrently, UA is limited due to bottlenecks. WID is low ('coming soon'). OSC is high. So, EI is currently constrained.\n\nIf bottlenecks are resolved and Web3 is integrated:\nUA (potential) = High (mainstream eSport)\nWID (potential) = High (wallet login, NFTs, crypto duels)\nOSC (current) = High\n\nTherefore, the *potential* EI is very high. The grant funds are requested to directly address the factors limiting UA and WID, making it a high-leverage investment for future impact.\n\nCost-Benefit Ratio: The investment now, while Web3 is nascent, could yield significant returns if the project achieves its mainstream goals and successfully onboards a large user base to Web3. The current cost is for foundational game development, which is a prerequisite for Web3 utility. The benefit is a highly scalable, open-source game that acts as a Web3 on-ramp. The ratio is favorable given the long-term vision, but the immediate Web3 impact is lower than desired for this specific round's focus.",

  "reasoning": "This application aligns strongly with several core principles of the Open Source Capitalist constitution. Principle 1 and 2 are met by the project's ambition to be a 'go-to game for most people' and its browser-based, open-source nature, which inherently supports broad, scalable impact. The focus on fixing 'bottlenecks' like online multiplayer and AI bots directly addresses Principle 4, supporting an efficient path to maximum impact by removing barriers to mainstream adoption. Furthermore, the project's stated goal of introducing people to open source and crypto/blockchains aligns with Principle 5 and 6, prioritizing long-term systemic change and fundamental infrastructure improvements for the Web3 ecosystem. The innovative aspect of a 'true eSport that doesn't have any chance based elements' resonates with Principle 9. Resource allocation (Principle 13 and 14) is well-justified by targeting features that will significantly increase the project's reach and effectiveness at scale. While the Web3 integration is 'coming soon,' the overall vision and existing open-source foundation demonstrate a clear path towards maximizing utility for the greatest number, as per Principle 20.",
