  "summary": "Ancient Beast is a turn-based strategy game that aims to introduce users to open-source game development and blockchain technology. The project is designed to be easy to learn, fun to play, and challenging to master. It offers features like online multiplayer, AI practice bots, and crypto duels. The project seeks funding to overcome current bottlenecks, such as implementing animations and enhancing multiplayer capabilities.",
  "review": "The Ancient Beast project presents a compelling case for funding within the GG23 OSS - dApps and Apps round. It aligns well with the round's goals by contributing to the growth of the open-source ecosystem and enhancing Web3 accessibility. The project is innovative in its approach to integrating blockchain technology with gaming, offering unique features like crypto duels and NFT marketplaces. However, the application lacks detailed information on how the grant funds will be specifically allocated to achieve the stated goals. Additionally, while the project has a clear vision, it needs to provide more concrete evidence of its current impact and user base to justify the scalability and broad impact claims. The project should also address the technical feasibility of its proposed features, such as blockchain integration and AI development, to strengthen its application.",
