  "summary": "Node Speak is a decentralized forum platform leveraging blockchain technology to address issues like censorship, arbitrary moderation, and lack of transparency in traditional online forums. It aims to provide a transparent, immutable, and community-driven experience by using smart contracts for governance and IPFS for data storage. The project plans to enhance its smart contracts, migrate to L1 for broader adoption, and integrate with other dApps. The grant will be used to maintain the web version and expand the development team.",
  "review": "Node Speak presents a compelling case for decentralizing online forums, addressing key issues such as censorship and lack of transparency. The use of blockchain and IPFS ensures data integrity and resistance to arbitrary content alteration, aligning well with the round's focus on enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability. The project's emphasis on decentralized governance and user incentives through token rewards is innovative, potentially driving user engagement and community growth. However, the application lacks detailed metrics for measuring impact and scalability, which are crucial for assessing long-term systemic change and total impact potential. Additionally, while the project outlines plans for L1 migration and dApp integration, it does not provide a clear timeline or specific milestones for these developments. The proposal could benefit from a more detailed budget breakdown to justify the requested grant amount and ensure efficient resource allocation.",
