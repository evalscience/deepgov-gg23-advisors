We also have several early-staged open hardware projects for space, so we are bringing Opensource to the final frontier, as well as aiming to lower the cost of space missions, making them more affordable.\n\nOne of our goals is to also onboard space engineers into web3 by deep integration of the LunCoSim, starting with basic things like gating via NFT, adding and experementing with mechaincs like IP-NFT on the way using tools like token engineering.",

On the other hand, Web3 provides advanced tools for file sharing and data exchange.\n\n![Multiuser](https://gateway.lighthouse.storage/ipfs/bafkreig7k3nrzb2q2a7eior6obhtoegdtp2dvkwmepm2fcyicngrub53om)\n\n## Inspired by\n\n### Professional\n1.

      "description": "***Accelerating Space Exploration through Open-Source Collaboration***\n\n## üöÄ Our Mission\n\nWe are on a mission to build Opensource Lunar Settlement and Web3 will make it possible!\n\nThat's a long way, that's starts with an Opensource Collaborative Lunar Colony Simulator - LunCoSim.\n\n## üéÆ Experience LunCoSim\n\nLunCoSim is revolutionizing Space Engineering by creating an immersive, Web3-integrated metaverse for designing lunar settlements.\n\nWe're bridging the gap between professional tools and modern gaming to make space exploration accessible to everyone.\n\nTry our browser-based simulation: [alpha.lunco.space](https://alpha.lunco.space) or download the binary build: [LunCo Build](https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim/releases/tag/v0.4.0-dev1)   \n![](https://gateway.lighthouse.storage/ipfs/bafkreidkb6bfjnjgoetexsot4l67glpz2n2z7vhpueela6gmxbvg3avo3a)\n\n\nWe have implemented Supply Chain modeling via Graph View ![](https://gateway.irys.xyz/W6tGPpjYb4r7DXQCuG9VdHm4ffJzTsjqqkUBNbnDTjQ) and implemented build-in [Modelica](https://modelica.org/) (an object oriented language to model cyber-physical systems) support ![](https://gateway.irys.xyz/AsQBWXvdt1xhYnW8NFdeL2LWzBRLmXcQJpPVjMYppwKr)\n\nAll those subsystems are available in 3D View, making interactive immersive simulation expirience possible: ![](https://gateway.irys.xyz/CTXEPAcexMh31dJGGgMBmPZYePRfumBAoUAa5ppUXchc)\n\n\n## We are promoting DeSpace and Onboarding Space Engineers into Web3\n\nOur founder was in charge of DeSpace Day at DevCon community Lab shilling DeSpace:\n\n![](https://gateway.irys.xyz/L1X9Hzr86yyWWbzdV6dNTDuDyJd5wCryuNEv2D1cChq)\n\n# üåü Why LunCo?\n\n- **Democratize Space Engineering**: Equal access to cutting-edge tools for all\n- **Reduce Costs**: Efficient knowledge sharing across global teams\n- **Foster Innovation**: Blend professional expertise with creative gaming concepts\n- **Web3 Integration**: Seamless collaboration, data sharing, and unique digital ownership\n\n## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features\n\n- **Multiplayer Simulation**: Collaborate in real-time with engineers worldwide\n- **Web3 Native**: Deep integration with Web3 technologies\n- **NFT Integration**: Unlock missions and assets with unique digital tokens\n- **Entities**: Control Starships, Robots, and more\n- **Cross-Platform**: Available on browser and desktop\n- **Modelica Integration**: Modelica is an industrial grade language for Modeling complex systems and now we support it\n\n## How it Works\n\nLunCo combines the power of space engineering with the accessibility of gaming and the innovation of Web3:\n\n1. **Mission Creation**: Users design lunar missions using our intuitive interface, selecting from a variety of assets (rovers, habitats, power systems) represented as NFTs\n\n2. **Simulation**: simulates mission scenarios in real-time, accounting for lunar gravity, terrain, and other space environment factors focusing on system-level effects\n\n3. **Collaboration**: Engineers and enthusiasts worldwide can join forces in multiplayer mode, sharing ideas and solving complex problems together\n\n4. **Web3 Integration**: \n   - Login seamlessly with MetaMask\n   - Use NFTs to share missions, assets, or features\n   - Store & Share Modelica & Supply Chain models as NFTs\n\n5. **Learn and Iterate**: Analyze mission results, refine your designs, and contribute to a growing knowledge base of lunar engineering solutions\n\n\n## Why Web3?\n\nWeb3 technology allows decentralization, which is crucial as engineering work is often dispersed across various teams. \n\nThe most common approach to knowledge sharing is email, which, while universal, is not the most efficient form of data exchange in today's digital age. On the other hand, Web3 provides advanced tools for file sharing and data exchange.\n\n![Multiuser](https://gateway.lighthouse.storage/ipfs/bafkreig7k3nrzb2q2a7eior6obhtoegdtp2dvkwmepm2fcyicngrub53om)\n\n## Inspired by\n\n### Professional\n1.
