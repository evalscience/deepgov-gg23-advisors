      "output": "To verify the claims made in the Kolektivo Network grant application regarding the need for $2 trillion annually for emerging and developing countries to combat climate change, as well as the project's progress since GG22, I will cross-reference these claims with reliable sources.\n\n### Claim 1: Need for $2 Trillion Annually for Climate Change in Emerging and Developing Countries\n\n1. **Verification of the $2 Trillion Claim**:\n   - The claim that emerging and developing countries require approximately $2 trillion annually to combat climate change aligns with findings from various reports and studies. For instance, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have highlighted significant funding gaps in climate finance, estimating that developing countries need substantial investments to meet their climate goals.\n   - A report from the **UN Climate Change Conference (COP26)** indicated that the estimated annual financing needs for developing countries could reach between $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion by 2030 to effectively address climate change impacts and transition to sustainable practices.\n\n2. **Confidence Level**: High. This figure is supported by multiple reputable sources and reflects a consensus in the climate finance community.\n\n### Claim 2: Progress of the Kolektivo Network Project Since GG22\n\n1. **Verification of Project Progress**:\n   - To assess the progress of the Kolektivo Network project since the **Global Goals (GG22)** summit, I would need to look for updates from the projectâ€™s official communications, such as press releases, project reports, or updates on their website or social media channels.\n   - As of my last training cut-off in October 2023, I do not have access to real-time data or updates post-GG22. However, if the project has been active, it is likely that they would have published updates on their achievements, milestones, or challenges faced since the summit.\n\n2. **Sources to Check**:\n   - Official website of the Kolektivo Network\n   - Social media platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)\n   - News articles or press releases related to the project\n   - Reports from climate finance or development organizations that may have collaborated with or reported on the Kolektivo Network\n\n3. **Confidence Level**: Medium. The need for further investigation into the project's progress is necessary, as it relies on the availability of current and specific information.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The claim regarding the need for $2 trillion annually for climate change efforts in emerging and developing countries is well-supported by credible sources and reflects a recognized funding gap.\n- The progress of the Kolektivo Network project since GG22 requires further investigation through current updates from the project itself or related news sources to provide a comprehensive assessment. \n\nIf you have access to specific updates or reports from the Kolektivo Network, I can help analyze those for further verification.",
