As an open-source project, we offer everyone the opportunity to contribute and improve the system, promoting collaboration and innovation within the community.\n\nThe main goal is to facilitate the adoption of this model by investors and Web2 companies, who traditionally use centralized platforms, to promote a gradual yet significant transition to Web3. We aim to make this innovative form of crowdfunding accessible to everyone, creating a bridge between Web2 and Web3. In this way, we expand access to decentralized reward crowdfunding for Web2 users and companies, encouraging a smooth and natural transition toward blockchain-based technologies.\n\nOur goal is to drive mass adoption of decentralized solutions, helping to build a more open, accessible, and inclusive ecosystem. Thanks to the open-source nature of the project, anyone can actively participate, contribute to the growth of the ecosystem, and benefit from the potential of decentralized solutions.",

          "answer": "What differentiates our dApp is the open-source nature of the platform, which promotes community-driven development and innovation. Unlike traditional centralized reward crowdfunding platforms, where users have limited control and transparency, our platform ensures that all transactions and rewards are managed transparently on the blockchain. This decentralized approach provides greater trust and security, as users can verify the entire funding process in real time. Additionally, by making the platform open-source, we invite contributions from a global community, enabling continuous improvement and adaptation to new needs and opportunities within the ecosystem.\n\nA key feature is that the fees generated by the platform do not go to the team but to the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), which uses them to build and innovate the ecosystem and the platform itself. This ensures that the resources are reinvested for continuous improvement, creating a sustainable growth cycle shared by all participants.\n\nWhen users invest, they receive various rewards, such as NFTs or other incentives, providing additional value for their participation. Furthermore, they can directly engage with the project creators, fostering a closer connection between backers and creators. Investors also have the option to use different investment methods, such as staking, to further enhance their experience and returns.\n\nBy focusing on these unique features and use cases, our goal is to create a more inclusive and accessible reward crowdfunding environment that fosters innovation, supports the transition to Web3, and enables long-term sustainability for all participants.",

          "answer": "The funds raised will be primarily used to increase liquidity in the pool by placing all funds in the TVL (Total Value Locked), ensuring greater stability and smoother transactions on the reward crowdfunding platform. This will allow for more efficient fund management and a better experience for backers, who will be able to receive rewards more quickly and securely. The remaining portion of the funds will be directed to the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), where the community will have the power to propose and vote on how these funds should be used. Proposals will include activities such as the ongoing development and improvement of the platform, marketing to increase adoption and project visibility, and other initiatives the community deems relevant. The primary goal is for every decision regarding the use of funds to be made transparently and collectively managed by the community through the DAO, ensuring that the resources are used in the best interest of all and to guarantee the long-term sustainable growth of the project.",
