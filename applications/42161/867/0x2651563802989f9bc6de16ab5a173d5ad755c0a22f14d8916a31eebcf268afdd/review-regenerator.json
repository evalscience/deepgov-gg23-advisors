Beepo's future development plans include enhancing blockchain interoperability, refining AI features, and expanding Web3 business tools, with grant funds supporting these initiatives.",
  "review": "The Beepo project presents a comprehensive approach to integrating decentralized communication and business tools with Web3 technologies. It demonstrates a strong commitment to open-source principles by contributing to existing protocols like XMTP and Web3Auth, and by developing new tools for decentralized commerce and social networking. The application highlights Beepo's unique features, such as wallet-to-wallet messaging, AI-driven moderation, and crypto payment integration, which differentiate it from traditional social apps and other Web3 platforms. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the project's impact on environmental sustainability and specific metrics for measuring success. Additionally, while the project outlines ambitious development goals, it would be helpful to see a more detailed timeline and budget allocation for these initiatives.",
