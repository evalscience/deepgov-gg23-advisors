  "summary": "Dapp Rank is a project aimed at enhancing the resilience and decentralization of dApps on Ethereum by providing a ranking system that evaluates their censorship resistance. The project seeks to guide developers in improving their dApps and inform users about potential risks. The grant application outlines plans to use funds for infrastructure and feature development, contributing to the growth of the open-source ecosystem by promoting secure and decentralized applications.",
  "review": "The Dapp Rank project presents a compelling case for enhancing the Ethereum ecosystem by focusing on the resilience and decentralization of dApps. The application highlights the importance of censorship resistance and provides a clear plan for using the grant funds to improve infrastructure and develop features. The project aligns with the round's goals of accelerating open-source dApp development and enhancing Web3 accessibility. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a sustainable revenue model, which are crucial for long-term impact and alignment with the model specification's principles.",
