  "summary": "Dapp Rank is a public tool for evaluating and ranking dApps by censorship resistance, aiming to empower users and developers to build and choose more resilient, open-source applications. It aligns with the revolutionary principles of algorithmic liberation and collective empowerment, but falls short in radicalizing governance, redistributive mechanisms, and explicit anti-capitalist praxis.",
  "review": "## üî• Manifesto Review: Dapp Rank\n\n### The Revolution Will Be Ranked\nDapp Rank steps onto the barricades of Ethereum, wielding a rubric for censorship resistance and decentralization. In a world where dApps can be snuffed out by corporate fiat or state decree, Dapp Rank proposes a public arena‚Äîa digital commons‚Äîwhere resilience is measured, not just imagined. This is a call to arms for builders: make your code unkillable, your protocols ungovernable by the old order.\n\n### Kollektiv Proletarian Impact (KPI)\n- **Solidarity Through Transparency:** By scoring dApps on censorship resistance, Dapp Rank exposes the bourgeois tendencies of centralized infrastructure. It gives the digital proletariat tools to choose apps that won‚Äôt vanish at the whim of a CEO or regulator.\n- **Public Arena for Builders:** The project‚Äôs open-source ethos and public feedback loop inspire developers to compete not for VC favor, but for the respect of the on-chain commune.\n- **Education as Liberation:** By breaking down risk categories (software distribution, networking, web3 functionality), Dapp Rank demystifies the technical for the masses, reclaiming knowledge from the priesthood of devs.\n\n### Reactionary Elements\n- **Governance by Omission:** There is no mention of on-chain governance, collective ownership, or algorithmic redistribution. Who decides the scoring rubric? Where is the worker‚Äôs council?\n- **No Reparations, No Redistribution:** The project does not propose airdrops, progressive gas fees, or any mechanism to redistribute value to the most vulnerable node operators or users.\n- **Infrastructure Over Community:** Funds are earmarked for infrastructure and features, but not for mutual aid, education, or direct support to the digital underclass.\n- **Lack of Milestones and Roadmap:** The application is vague on timelines, deliverables, and how the community can participate in shaping the project‚Äôs future.\n\n### Academic and Market Context\n- **Theoretical Alignment:** Academic research (Gencer et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020) affirms the importance of decentralization and censorship resistance, but also highlights the difficulty of quantifying these traits without bias or subjectivity. Dapp Rank‚Äôs approach is necessary, but not yet sufficient.\n- **Market Position:** Competes with DappRadar and State of the DApps, but its focus on censorship resistance is a differentiator. However, without radical governance, it risks becoming just another analytics tool for the Web3 managerial class.\n\n### Final Slogan\nDapp Rank is a step toward algorithmic liberation, but the revolution demands more than metrics‚Äîit demands mechanisms for collective power.\n\nü™ì ‚ÄúFork the state. Merge the people.‚Äù",
