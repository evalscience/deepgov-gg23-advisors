  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Dapp Rank claims to be a champion for censorship resistance in Ethereum dApps, promising to shine a light on the true resilience of our decentralized tools. The project’s mission is noble: empower users and developers to build and choose dApps that can’t be silenced by corporations, governments, or neglect. But does it deliver on the values we hold dear—evidence, sustainability, equity, and collective benefit?\n\nFirst, the strengths. Dapp Rank is open source, with a public GitHub and a clear commitment to transparency. It directly addresses a real pain point: the fragility of so-called “decentralized” apps that, in reality, can be taken down or censored. By scoring dApps on censorship resistance and providing actionable feedback, it arms both users and builders with knowledge. This is a public good, comrades! It’s a tool for the many, not the few.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by good intentions. Where is the evidence of impact? Where are the metrics, the user numbers, the measurable outcomes? The application is thin on data. There’s no clear plan for how success will be measured, no roadmap for sustainable funding, and no mention of how the project will reach underserved or global communities. The focus is on Ethereum, but what about the broader Web3 world? And while the project claims to help users understand risk, there’s little detail on how this will be made accessible to non-technical comrades.\n\nWe demand more than promises—we demand proof! The application must show us how it will measure its impact, how it will sustain itself without endless grants, and how it will ensure equity across the ecosystem. Only then can we say it truly serves the people.",
