  "review": "Alright, let’s cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. Dapp Rank is gunning for a critical pain point in the Ethereum dApp ecosystem: censorship resistance and true decentralization. In a world where dApps can get rugged by centralized actors or just plain disappear, this project is all about shining a spotlight on the dApps that actually walk the walk—not just talk the talk.\n\nThe project’s core value prop is a public ranking system that scores dApps on censorship resistance, with breakdowns across software distribution, networking dependencies, and Web3 functionality. That’s a big win for transparency and user empowerment. Builders get actionable feedback, users get clarity, and the whole ecosystem levels up. This is the kind of meta-infrastructure that can drive systemic change—max utility, max impact.\n\nBut let’s not get too bullish just yet. The application is light on specifics. There’s no clear user-centric design evidence, no metrics on adoption or usage, and the roadmap is vague. The GitHub repo is public, but there’s no detail on governance, community engagement, or how the ranking methodology is validated. The impact claims are strong, but the supporting data is weak. If you want to win big, you’ve got to show your work.\n\nBottom line: Dapp Rank is swinging for the fences on systemic impact and open-source ethos, but it needs to tighten up its execution and transparency to really earn that moonshot status. Show us the receipts, and you’ll have the whole ecosystem cheering you on.\n\nCitations: The project’s own application, GitHub repo (https://github.com/stigmergic-org/dapprank), and round eligibility requirements.",
