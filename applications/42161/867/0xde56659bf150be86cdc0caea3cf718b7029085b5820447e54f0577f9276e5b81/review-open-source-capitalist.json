  "summary": "Dapp Rank is a project aimed at enhancing the resilience and security of decentralized applications (dapps) on Ethereum by providing a ranking system based on censorship resistance. The project seeks to guide developers in improving their dapps' decentralization and offers users a reliable tool to assess dapp resilience. The grant funds are intended for infrastructure costs and feature development to improve the dapp ecosystem.",
  "review": "The Dapp Rank project presents a compelling case for enhancing the Ethereum ecosystem by focusing on the resilience and security of dapps. The project's emphasis on censorship resistance aligns well with the round's goal of accelerating open-source dApp development. By providing a ranking system, Dapp Rank aims to guide developers in creating more secure and decentralized applications, which is crucial for the long-term growth of the Web3 ecosystem. The project also plans to use the grant funds efficiently, prioritizing infrastructure and feature development, which is a strategic approach to achieving its goals. However, the application lacks detailed information on user-centric design and specific examples of innovation, which are critical for meeting the round's eligibility requirements.",
