        "description": "Kiwi is a space for people who care about Ethereum, beyond its price. \n\nIt’s a place where everyone can follow the most important ETH ideas and projects without Twitter noise. They can also connect with other Ethereum power users through deep, nuanced discussions.\n\nWe've been building Kiwi since 2023 because we believe that Ethereum should have a decentralized 'online magazine', where you can become smarter every time you read it.\n\nThat's why every month our community of 100+ Ethereum power users goes through hundreds of tweets, blogposts, dashboards, newsletters and products, to surface the ones that stand out. \n\nEveryone can join them and start sharing, upvoting, and discussing the links with our community. Everyone can also just read Kiwi and join our 2,000+ monthly readers.\n\nWe care about building IRL connections between our curators and users so we have been organizing meetups during main ETH conferences in Berlin, Paris, Warsaw, Bangkok & Istanbul.\n\nSince we care about Ethereum, we also organize writing contests that touch on important ETH ideas. Like the one we did about L2s with Lens (https://paragraph.xyz/@kiwi-updates/pluralistic-future-of-l2s-results), where we ended up receiving 20+ submissions. \n\nSome of the submissions came from people such as Marek (Co-Founder @ Celo), Simon de la Rouviere (Co-inventor of ERC20), and Jason Chaskin (Researcher @ Ethereum Foundation). And one of the contest prompts came from Vitalik.\n\nWe also care deeply about decentralization. That's why all Kiwi content - 13,000+ links and 4,000+ comments - is stored on a P2P network. \n\nThis means that everyone can build their own client, like on Farcaster or Lens. There's been already alt client like kiwinews.lol (kiwinews.lol) and search engines like KNSearch (https://knsearch.x4901.xyz/).\n\nAlso, everything on Kiwi is open source: our front-end, back-end and protocol code. So the fruits of our R&D work on key delegation, onchain ads, and implementing passkeys is publicly available for other projects to use.\n\nSince we wanted to stay independent, we refused to take VC money, and since the beginning we have been living off grants, a bit of revenue, and our savings. So far we received grants from Optimism Retro Funding, Octant, Gitcoin OSS rounds, Farcaster, Purple, and a few more.\n\nSo if you care about changing the way people think about Ethereum and helping builders get the best ideas, please consider supporting Kiwi.\n\nYou can check our app on news.kiwistand.com\n\nYou can also read more about us here: kiwistand.github.io/kiwi-docs\n\nOr go through our GitHub repo: github.com/attestate/kiwistand",
