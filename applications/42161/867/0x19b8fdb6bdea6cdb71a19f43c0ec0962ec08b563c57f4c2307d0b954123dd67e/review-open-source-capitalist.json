  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. Kiwi News is a decentralized, open-source, community-curated news aggregator for Ethereum—think \"Hacker News for ETH heads,\" minus the Twitter drama. The project is 100% open source, with all code (front-end, back-end, P2P protocol) out in the wild for anyone to fork, hack, or build on. That’s pure OSS energy, and it’s already spawned alt clients and search engines, showing real ecosystem impact.\n\nKiwi’s core value prop is curation: 100+ power users sift through the crypto haystack to surface the best ETH content, and 2,000+ monthly readers benefit. The P2P protocol means anyone can spin up their own client—decentralization FTW. The team’s R&D (key delegation, passkeys, onchain ads) is all public, so other builders can plug and play. Community engagement is strong: meetups, writing contests, and open dev chats keep the feedback loop tight.\n\nOn the dev side, the next milestone is turbocharging the comments system for real-time, Telegram-style convos. That’s a legit technical challenge, and the team is transparent about the resource constraints (just two devs, moving fast, squashing bugs). Prior grant history is solid, and the project’s refusal to take VC money signals strong alignment with OSS values.\n\nBut let’s not sugarcoat it: Kiwi News is still niche. The user base is small compared to mainstream platforms, and the roadmap is light on specifics—no hard metrics on growth, retention, or how the new features will drive scale. The impact is real, but not yet massive. For a round focused on max utility and broad impact, Kiwi needs to show how it’ll break out of the ETH echo chamber and onboard the next wave of users.\n\nBottom line: Kiwi News is OSS to the core, shipping real tech, and building in public. But to hit max utility and win big in this round, they need a clearer plan for scaling up and quantifying impact. Show us the growth hacks, the funnel metrics, and the path to 10x the user base. That’s how you disrupt the system and go from niche to necessary.\n",
