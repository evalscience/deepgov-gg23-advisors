  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Kiwi News stands as a beacon for Ethereum’s thinkers, not just its speculators. This project is open source to the core, with every line of code and every technical decision laid bare for the world to see. That’s the spirit of the commons! Their commitment to decentralization is real: all content is stored on a P2P network, and alternative clients have already sprung up. This is not just talk—this is action!\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by passion alone. Where is the hard evidence of impact? The application boasts 2,000+ monthly readers and 100+ power users, but where are the metrics on engagement, growth, or retention? Where is the data showing how Kiwi News advances financial inclusion, education, or social impact? The project’s sustainability is also in question. They proudly refuse VC money and rely on grants, but what’s the plan for long-term survival? A movement cannot live on hope and handouts alone!\n\nThe roadmap is focused on improving comments and fixing bugs—worthy goals, but where is the structured plan, the measurable milestones, the transparent reporting? We need more than good intentions; we need proof, comrades! Show us the numbers, the outcomes, the real-world change!\n\nIn summary: Kiwi News is a promising, community-driven project with a strong open-source ethos and a clear commitment to decentralization. But to earn the people’s trust—and the people’s resources—they must deliver hard evidence, a sustainable plan, and a rigorous approach to measuring impact. Let’s demand more, together!",
