  "review": "Comrades, let’s get straight to the heart of the matter! Kiwi News stands as a beacon for the Ethereum community, cutting through the noise and delivering curated, high-quality content. This is not just another aggregator—this is a people-powered, open-source platform, built by and for the community, with every line of code and every comment open for scrutiny and contribution. That’s the spirit of the commons!\n\nThe project’s commitment to open source is ironclad. Every protocol, every feature, every bug fix is out in the open, inviting collaboration and scrutiny. The P2P protocol and decentralized storage of all content—over 13,000 links and 4,000 comments—are not just technical feats, but acts of resistance against centralization and corporate control. Kiwi News is not just talking the talk; they’re walking the walk, with alternative clients and search engines already springing up from their open infrastructure.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by sentiment. The application is clear about its impact: 2,000+ monthly readers, 100+ active curators, and a history of community-driven events and writing contests. The project’s differentiation is real—no single gatekeeper, no algorithmic manipulation, just collective curation. This is the kind of grassroots, user-centric design that the round demands.\n\nYet, comrades, we must demand more! The application is light on hard, quantifiable outcomes. Where are the metrics on user growth, engagement, or the impact of their R&D on the broader ecosystem? Where is the roadmap for financial sustainability? The project’s reliance on grants and savings is noble, but it is not a long-term solution. We need to see a plan for revenue, for independence, for true sustainability.\n\nIn summary: Kiwi News is a shining example of open-source, community-driven development, but it must strengthen its case with hard data and a clear path to sustainability. The revolution is not won with ideals alone—it is won with results!",
