Onchain Verifiable (Tech)\n\n\n# Features & Use Cases of Byte Onchain\n\n1. Multi-Chain Web3 Onboarding Usecase\n- Users are guided through an onboarding process with their community:\n- Download a wallet (e.g., Metamask).\n- Add supported chains like, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, or Celo.\n- Receive $0.20 - $1 worth of gas fees directly from community members or (on-chain - we're working on this).\n- Complete a simple quiz (based on the project or community onboarding needs).\n- Sign an attestation proving onboarding completion using open protocols like EAS\n\n2. On-Chain Attestation & Credentialing Features\nByte Onchain integrates the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) to issue on-chain credentials. These attestations serve as tamper-proof proof of onboarding, quiz completion, or other learning outcomes.\n\n3. Admin Panel Features for DAO & Community Leaders\nByte Onchain offers an Admin Panel where organizers (e.g., DAOs, Web3 clubs, event hosts) can:\n- Customize quizzes to suit their project or ecosystem.\n- View participants and their scores.\n- Track on-chain attestations issued.\n- Manage gas fee distributions (Working on this)\n\n# What sets us apart, how we're differentiated.\n\n1. Byteonchain.xyz offers a simpler, verifiable, and community-driven approach to Web3 onboarding and education. Unlike other onboarding tools, we don’t just introduce users to wallets and blockchains—we provide a measurable, on-chain record of their learning journey. This is what sets us apart:\n\n2. Verifiable Onboarding with On-Chain Attestations\nMost competitors offer guides and tutorials but lack a way to verify whether a user actually completed onboarding.\n\n3. Byteonchain.xyz tracks onboarding progress and issues on-chain attestations, ensuring users complete the necessary steps before moving forward.\n\n4. Community-Driven Gas Fee Support\nTraditional onboarding methods require users to self-fund their first blockchain transaction, which can be a barrier.\n\n5. We enable communities to sponsor gas fees ($0.20 - $1) to help users complete their first transaction.\n\n6. Integration with Web3 Events, DAOs, and Hackathons\nMany onboarding platforms focus on static courses without integration into real Web3 experiences.\nByteonchain.xyz is built for live events, allowing hackathons, DAOs, and Web3 conferences to track who has successfully onboarded.\n\n7. Simplified, Gamified Learning Process\nUnlike complex courses that overwhelm beginners, our approach uses:\n\n- Step-by-step wallet and blockchain setup\n- Community quizzes to reinforce learning\n- On-chain certifications to prove completion\n\n8. On-Chain Certifications for Courses\nMany Web3 courses and learning platforms don’t provide blockchain-based proof of completion.\nWith Byteonchain.xyz, users can claim certifications as on-chain attestations by purchasing a less than $0.20 token to cover gas fees, making their achievements verifiable onchain.\n\n\nOur focus is on growing Web3 participation and supporting open-source contributors, ensuring long-term ecosystem sustainability.",

From setting up their first wallet to successfully making their first onchain attestations, \n\nByte Onchain simplifies the entire onboarding journey in 10 Minutes.\n\n\n\n**View Schemas Here**\nhttps://byteonchain.xyz/schema\n[![Screenshot-2025-03-18-164938.png](https://i.postimg.cc/hPtpfD01/Screenshot-2025-03-18-164938.png)](https://postimg.cc/mhKQnGJP)\n\nByte Dapp targets Web2 developers interested in learning about web3 technologies and building web3 tools, OSS or products.\n\n**THE PROBLEM**\n\n* 1. Most Web3 events lack dedicated onboarding sessions and activations, this leaves leaves newbies  just listening to speakers and not actually getting onboarded.\n\n* 2. Most event organisers don't have a simpler way of incentivizing newbies to download wallets and interact onchain in a fun way.\n\n* 3. Web3 courses and developer transition programs often fail to provide on-chain certifications or verifiable attestations.\n\n*4. Existing onboarding activities lack a clear, measurable way to determine whether users have completed the process.\n\n**THE SOLUTION**\n\nByteonchain.xyz makes the Web3 onboarding and educational process, such that the experience for the newbies is both;\n\na. Community Centric (Human)\nb. Onchain Verifiable (Tech)\n\n\nWe used Byte Onchain to onboard over 100 attendees at 2 Campus web3 events.\n\nBayero University Kano Onboarding\nhttps://x.com/_karlagod/status/1891169957641126158?t=m5aYBZYk6z3OaBRMV1ys3g&s=19\n\nThe University of Nigeria Nsukka\nhttps://x.com/_karlagod/status/1893316079365116173\n\n\n\n**USER JOURNEY/RATIONALE**\n\n\n# STEP 1: Wallet Setup & Blockchain Interaction\n\nUsers download a Web3 wallet and add the relevant blockchain network, introducing them to wallet activity and blockchain interactions.\n\n* Rationale: Most users won't know how to go about setting up a wallet, and this would prompt community interactions and support, onboarding booth visitations during an event.\n\n# Download Wallet\n[![Gj6-UTCb-Xs-AALx3f.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/3JsGLV8v/Gj6-UTCb-Xs-AALx3f.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/9rBz0xqm)\n\n# Create a profile on byteonchain.xyz\n[![photo-2025-03-18-20-56-38-2.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/ZKC0Sq27/photo-2025-03-18-20-56-38-2.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/xcV9G90M)\n\n# STEP 2: Gas Fee Support for First Transactions\n\nUsers share their wallet addresses with their community to receive a small gas fee ($0.20 - $1), which enables them to sign their first blockchain transaction.\n\n* Rationale: It's great when newbies receive their first token from a community, it's a core memory formed off-chain, and it creates a bond between the newbie and the community.\n\n[![photo-2025-03-18-20-56-38.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/xTG0Dncv/photo-2025-03-18-20-56-38.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/D8ZV1VQ0)\n\n\n# STEP 3: Community Quiz & On-Chain Attestation\n\nUsers go to the quiz secion to complete a community quiz, reinforcing their understanding of Web3 concepts or the community or event questions.\n\nAfter completing the quiz, they sign an on-chain attestation, which records their score, profile, and onboarding/course details as a verifiable credential.\n\nRationale: Fun activity and gamified onboarding process, that gives the user an expectation.\n\n[![photo-2025-03-18-20-56-35.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/y6gX7Y4S/photo-2025-03-18-20-56-35.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/NLtr4t0g)\n\n[![photo-2025-03-18-20-56-37.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/pVJ8W9cr/photo-2025-03-18-20-56-37.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/6TTTzQXx)\n\n# STEP 4: Educational Attestations & Certification\n\nRationale: Conclusion and Proof of Onboarding.\n[![Gktd-Mw-EWo-AARWSM.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/BZ8XW6dh/Gktd-Mw-EWo-AARWSM.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/9zhWZWXT)\n\nhttps://x.com/BorderlessDev/status/1894710548350009471?t=CgiJG44GoLSPGxjzCPEOKw&s=19\n\nYou can view the attestations here;\n\n* Onboarding\nhttps://arbitrum.easscan.org/schema/view/0xadc627b3baae8680c1e7d1f080ea5e50738e7efcc93e95a35269e6841116fffe\n\n* Course\nhttps://arbitrum.easscan.org/schema/view/0xe9a059a2f6cf3a119b0f8c1d5dc022711a447c7fbb94baf6ce670ca2e6faeaeb\n\n\n\nRELEVANCE\nFor structured Web3 courses, users can purchase a $1 token of the deployed chain to cover gas fees and claim their certification as an on-chain verifiable attestation.\n\nWith byteonchain.xyz, Web3 onboarding is engaging, verifiable, and organized, allowing newcomers to finish the journey with tangible evidence of their learning.\n\n\n## What sets us apart\n\nByteonchain.xyz offers a simpler, verifiable, and community-driven approach to Web3 onboarding and education.

      "description": "# Byte Onchain \n\nByte Onchain is an educational and onboarding tool that guides complete beginners—who have no prior knowledge of crypto wallets—through every step of getting started onchain. From setting up their first wallet to successfully making their first onchain attestations, \n\nByte Onchain simplifies the entire onboarding journey in 10 Minutes.\n\n\n\n**View Schemas Here**\nhttps://byteonchain.xyz/schema\n[![Screenshot-2025-03-18-164938.png](https://i.postimg.cc/hPtpfD01/Screenshot-2025-03-18-164938.png)](https://postimg.cc/mhKQnGJP)\n\nByte Dapp targets Web2 developers interested in learning about web3 technologies and building web3 tools, OSS or products.\n\n**THE PROBLEM**\n\n* 1. Most Web3 events lack dedicated onboarding sessions and activations, this leaves leaves newbies  just listening to speakers and not actually getting onboarded.\n\n* 2. Most event organisers don't have a simpler way of incentivizing newbies to download wallets and interact onchain in a fun way.\n\n* 3. Web3 courses and developer transition programs often fail to provide on-chain certifications or verifiable attestations.\n\n* 4. Existing onboarding activities lack a clear, measurable way to determine whether users have completed the process.\n\n**THE SOLUTION**\n\nByteonchain.xyz makes the Web3 onboarding and educational process, such that the experience for the newbies is both;\n\na. Community Centric (Human)\nb. Onchain Verifiable (Tech)\n\n\nWe used Byte Onchain to onboard over 100 attendees at 2 Campus web3 events.\n\nBayero University Kano Onboarding\nhttps://x.com/_karlagod/status/1891169957641126158?t=m5aYBZYk6z3OaBRMV1ys3g&s=19\n\nThe University of Nigeria Nsukka\nhttps://x.com/_karlagod/status/1893316079365116173\n\n\n\n**USER JOURNEY/RATIONALE**\n\n\n# STEP 1: Wallet Setup & Blockchain Interaction\n\nUsers download a Web3 wallet and add the relevant blockchain network, introducing them to wallet activity and blockchain interactions.\n\n* Rationale: Most users won't know how to go about setting up a wallet, and this would prompt community interactions and support, onboarding booth visitations during an event.\n\n# Download Wallet\n[![Gj6-UTCb-Xs-AALx3f.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/3JsGLV8v/Gj6-UTCb-Xs-AALx3f.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/9rBz0xqm)\n\n# Create a profile on byteonchain.xyz\n[![photo-2025-03-18-20-56-38-2.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/ZKC0Sq27/photo-2025-03-18-20-56-38-2.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/xcV9G90M)\n\n# STEP 2: Gas Fee Support for First Transactions\n\nUsers share their wallet addresses with their community to receive a small gas fee ($0.20 - $1), which enables them to sign their first blockchain transaction.\n\n* Rationale: It's great when newbies receive their first token from a community, it's a core memory formed off-chain, and it creates a bond between the newbie and the community.\n\n[![photo-2025-03-18-20-56-38.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/xTG0Dncv/photo-2025-03-18-20-56-38.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/D8ZV1VQ0)\n\n\n# STEP 3: Community Quiz & On-Chain Attestation\n\nUsers go to the quiz secion to complete a community quiz, reinforcing their understanding of Web3 concepts or the community or event questions.\n\nAfter completing the quiz, they sign an on-chain attestation, which records their score, profile, and onboarding/course details as a verifiable credential.\n\nRationale: Fun activity and gamified onboarding process, that gives the user an expectation.\n\n[![photo-2025-03-18-20-56-35.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/y6gX7Y4S/photo-2025-03-18-20-56-35.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/NLtr4t0g)\n\n[![photo-2025-03-18-20-56-37.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/pVJ8W9cr/photo-2025-03-18-20-56-37.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/6TTTzQXx)\n\n# STEP 4: Educational Attestations & Certification\n\nRationale: Conclusion and Proof of Onboarding.\n[![Gktd-Mw-EWo-AARWSM.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/BZ8XW6dh/Gktd-Mw-EWo-AARWSM.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/9zhWZWXT)\n\nhttps://x.com/BorderlessDev/status/1894710548350009471?t=CgiJG44GoLSPGxjzCPEOKw&s=19\n\nYou can view the attestations here;\n\n* Onboarding\nhttps://arbitrum.easscan.org/schema/view/0xadc627b3baae8680c1e7d1f080ea5e50738e7efcc93e95a35269e6841116fffe\n\n* Course\nhttps://arbitrum.easscan.org/schema/view/0xe9a059a2f6cf3a119b0f8c1d5dc022711a447c7fbb94baf6ce670ca2e6faeaeb\n\n\n\nRELEVANCE\nFor structured Web3 courses, users can purchase a $1 token of the deployed chain to cover gas fees and claim their certification as an on-chain verifiable attestation.\n\nWith byteonchain.xyz, Web3 onboarding is engaging, verifiable, and organized, allowing newcomers to finish the journey with tangible evidence of their learning.\n\n\n## What sets us apart\n\nByteonchain.xyz offers a simpler, verifiable, and community-driven approach to Web3 onboarding and education. Unlike other onboarding tools, we don’t just introduce users to wallets and blockchains—we provide a measurable, on-chain record of their learning journey. This is what sets us apart:\n\n1. Verifiable Onboarding with On-Chain Attestations\n\nMost competitors offer guides and tutorials but lack a way to verify whether a user actually completed onboarding.\n\nByteonchain.xyz tracks onboarding progress and issues on-chain attestations, ensuring users complete the necessary steps before moving forward.\n\n2. Community-Driven Gas Fee Support\n\nTraditional onboarding methods require users to self-fund their first blockchain transaction, which can be a barrier.\n\nWe enable communities to sponsor gas fees ($0.20 - $1) to help users complete their first transaction.\n\n3. Integration with Web3 Events, DAOs, and Hackathons\n\nMany onboarding platforms focus on static courses without integration into real Web3 experiences.\n\nByteonchain.xyz is built for live events, allowing hackathons, DAOs, and Web3 conferences to track who has successfully onboarded.\n\n4. Simplified, Gamified Learning Process\n\nUnlike complex courses that overwhelm beginners, our approach uses:\n\nStep-by-step wallet and blockchain setup\n\nCommunity quizzes to reinforce learning\n\nOn-chain certifications to prove completion\n\n5. On-Chain Certifications for Courses\n\nMany Web3 courses and learning platforms don’t provide blockchain-based proof of completion.\n\nWith Byteonchain.xyz, users can claim certifications as on-chain attestations by purchasing a $1 token to cover gas fees, making their achievements verifiable across Web3 platforms.\n\n6. Public Goods & Open-Source Focus\n\nWhile competitors often charge high fees for onboarding or certifications, we align with Public Goods principles.\n\nOur focus is on growing Web3 participation and supporting open-source contributors, ensuring long-term ecosystem sustainability.\n\n\n## Who can use byteonchain.xyz\n\n1. Web3 Newcomers & Enthusiasts\n\n- Individuals looking to understand blockchain, wallets, and smart contract interactions.\n- Crypto-curious users who need structured onboarding rather than fragmented, complex guides.\n\n2. University Students & Developers Transitioning to Web3\n\n- Students and developers eager to **learn blockchain development, DeFi, and smart contracts**.\n- Those transitioning from Web2 to Web3, requiring **hands-on learning and verifiable attestations**.\n\n3. Web3 Event Organizers & Hackathon Hosts\n\n- Web3 conferences, DAOs, and hackathons that want seamless onboarding experiences for their participants.\n- Hosts looking for a structured way to track onboarding completion and issue on-chain credentials.\n\n4. DAOs, Communities & Public Goods Projects\n\n- Blockchain communities that want a standardized, measurable onboarding process for new members.\n- DAOs and Web3 organizations looking to issue decentralized credentials to contributors and learners.\n\n5. Web3 Education Platforms & Content Creators\n\n- Online courses, bootcamps, and educators who want on-chain certifications for their students.\n- YouTubers, bloggers, and influencers promoting Web3 adoption and seeking tools to verify learning outcomes.\n\n6.
