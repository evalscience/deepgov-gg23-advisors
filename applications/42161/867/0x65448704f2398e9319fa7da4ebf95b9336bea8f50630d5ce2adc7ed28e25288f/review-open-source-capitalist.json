  "summary": "Byte Onchain is an open-source educational and onboarding tool designed to simplify the Web3 onboarding process for beginners. It offers a community-centric and on-chain verifiable approach, providing users with a structured journey from setting up wallets to making on-chain attestations. The project aims to enhance Web3 accessibility and usability by integrating with events, DAOs, and hackathons, and by offering features like community-driven gas fee support and on-chain certifications. Byte Onchain is committed to fostering open-source contributions and supporting the growth of the Web3 ecosystem.",
  "review": "The Byte Onchain project presents a compelling case for enhancing Web3 onboarding through its open-source platform. The application highlights several strengths, including its focus on community-driven onboarding, verifiable on-chain attestations, and integration with real-world Web3 events. The project has demonstrated its impact by onboarding over 200 individuals and receiving contributions from university students, which aligns with the round's focus on education and social impact. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics on user engagement and the effectiveness of its onboarding process. Additionally, while the project outlines ambitious future plans, it lacks specific timelines and resource allocation details for these developments. Overall, Byte Onchain aligns well with the round's objectives, but further clarity on its scalability and long-term impact would strengthen its case.",
