This allows developers, event organizers, DAOs, and hackathon hosts to easily customize and deploy their own onboarding quizzes or courses, we also created admin dashboards so anyone can create their own quizzes and onboarding sessions.  \n\n**Impact:**  \nUniversity Web3 clubs and event organizers are already using Byte Onchain’s code to create tailored onboarding solutions for their events and communities.  \n\n2. **Boosting On-Chain Credentials**  \nByte Onchain utilizes open-source credentialing protocols like EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service), enabling on-chain attestations (e.g., proof of onboarding or course completion) on networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and Celo.  \n\n**Impact:**  \nOver 200 attestations have been issued via Byte Onchain, driving the adoption of decentralized identity standards and promoting open-source tools for verifiable credentials.  \n\n3. **Increasing OSS Contributors**  \nByte Onchain helps Web2 developers transition into Web3 by introducing them to open-source principles, GitHub workflows, and Public Goods concepts.  \n\n**Impact:**  \nDevelopers evolve from learners to active contributors. For example, students from Bayero University Kano and the University of Nigeria Nsukka have contributed to Byte On-chain’s repositories and other Web3 public goods projects.  \n\n4. **Supporting DAO Onboarding Activities**  \nByte Onchain provides an affordable, open-source onboarding solution for DAOs.\n\n**Impact:**  \nSimplifies onboarding process for DAO admins and makes it faster.\n\n5. **Community-Driven Development**  \nByte Onchain’s open-source dApp and Admin Panel invite developers worldwide to propose improvements, fix bugs, and enhance UX/UI.  \n\n**Impact:**  \nThe project has already received contributions and feedback from external developers, fostering collaboration and strengthening the open-source ecosystem in the Web3 onboarding space.  \n\nByte Onchain is building a more accessible, collaborative, and decentralized future for Web3 onboarding.

Onchain Verifiable (Tech)\n\n\n# Features & Use Cases of Byte Onchain\n\n1. Multi-Chain Web3 Onboarding Usecase\n- Users are guided through an onboarding process with their community:\n- Download a wallet (e.g., Metamask).\n- Add supported chains like, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, or Celo.\n- Receive $0.20 - $1 worth of gas fees directly from community members or (on-chain - we're working on this).\n- Complete a simple quiz (based on the project or community onboarding needs).\n- Sign an attestation proving onboarding completion using open protocols like EAS\n\n2. On-Chain Attestation & Credentialing Features\nByte Onchain integrates the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) to issue on-chain credentials. These attestations serve as tamper-proof proof of onboarding, quiz completion, or other learning outcomes.\n\n3. Admin Panel Features for DAO & Community Leaders\nByte Onchain offers an Admin Panel where organizers (e.g., DAOs, Web3 clubs, event hosts) can:\n- Customize quizzes to suit their project or ecosystem.\n- View participants and their scores.\n- Track on-chain attestations issued.\n- Manage gas fee distributions (Working on this)\n\n# What sets us apart, how we're differentiated.\n\n1. Byteonchain.xyz offers a simpler, verifiable, and community-driven approach to Web3 onboarding and education. Unlike other onboarding tools, we don’t just introduce users to wallets and blockchains—we provide a measurable, on-chain record of their learning journey. This is what sets us apart:\n\n2. Verifiable Onboarding with On-Chain Attestations\nMost competitors offer guides and tutorials but lack a way to verify whether a user actually completed onboarding.\n\n3. Byteonchain.xyz tracks onboarding progress and issues on-chain attestations, ensuring users complete the necessary steps before moving forward.\n\n4. Community-Driven Gas Fee Support\nTraditional onboarding methods require users to self-fund their first blockchain transaction, which can be a barrier.\n\n5. We enable communities to sponsor gas fees ($0.20 - $1) to help users complete their first transaction.\n\n6. Integration with Web3 Events, DAOs, and Hackathons\nMany onboarding platforms focus on static courses without integration into real Web3 experiences.\nByteonchain.xyz is built for live events, allowing hackathons, DAOs, and Web3 conferences to track who has successfully onboarded.\n\n7. Simplified, Gamified Learning Process\nUnlike complex courses that overwhelm beginners, our approach uses:\n\n- Step-by-step wallet and blockchain setup\n- Community quizzes to reinforce learning\n- On-chain certifications to prove completion\n\n8. On-Chain Certifications for Courses\nMany Web3 courses and learning platforms don’t provide blockchain-based proof of completion.\nWith Byteonchain.xyz, users can claim certifications as on-chain attestations by purchasing a less than $0.20 token to cover gas fees, making their achievements verifiable onchain.\n\n\nOur focus is on growing Web3 participation and supporting open-source contributors, ensuring long-term ecosystem sustainability."
