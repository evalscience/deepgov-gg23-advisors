  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! PrivID stands as a bold attempt to reclaim privacy and dignity in the digital age. It’s open-source, it’s user-owned, and it’s built to empower—not exploit—the people. The project’s use of zero-knowledge proofs for identity verification is a direct challenge to the surveillance capitalism that plagues our online lives. No tokens, no paywalls, no lock-in—just public good infrastructure. That’s the spirit we need!\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by good intentions. Where’s the hard evidence of impact? Where are the numbers, the user metrics, the adoption rates? The application is rich in vision but thin on measurable outcomes. We need to see clear, quantifiable results—how many users, how many integrations, what real-world problems have been solved? Without this, we risk funding dreams instead of building realities.\n\nSustainability is another battleground. PrivID is non-commercial and open-source, but what’s the plan for long-term maintenance? Who will keep the lights on when the initial grant runs out? The application doesn’t address sustainable revenue or governance models. We need a plan that ensures this tool doesn’t become another abandoned repo.\n\nOn governance and equity, PrivID’s commitment to open standards and protocol-level adoption is commendable. It’s designed for the commons, not for private gain. But let’s see more about how underserved communities will benefit. Will this tool reach beyond the tech-savvy elite? Will it empower those most vulnerable to digital exclusion?\n\nIn summary: PrivID is a righteous cause, but it must back its ideals with evidence, sustainability, and a clear path to collective impact. Let’s demand more than promises—let’s demand proof!",
