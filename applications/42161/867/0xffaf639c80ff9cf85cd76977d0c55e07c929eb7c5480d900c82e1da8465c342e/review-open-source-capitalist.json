  "summary": "PrivID is an open-source protocol designed to provide privacy-preserving identity verification using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). It integrates with decentralized identity standards like the AT Protocol, aiming to enhance trust in decentralized social apps. The project offers reusable SDKs, a zero-knowledge proof UX toolkit, and a modular architecture, all under an MIT/Apache license. The application outlines a roadmap for development, including browser extensions, CLI tools, and integration with Holonym for ZK proof-based verification. The grant funds are intended for development, integration, security reviews, and documentation.",
  "review": "PrivID presents a compelling case for enhancing privacy-preserving identity verification in decentralized networks. The use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) aligns with the constitutional principles of maximizing impact and innovation. The project is open-source, which supports the growth of the OSS ecosystem, and it aims to integrate with existing decentralized identity standards, promoting scalability and systemic change. However, the application lacks detailed metrics for measuring impact and scalability, which are crucial for evaluating its potential for broad, scalable impact. Additionally, while the project is innovative, the application could benefit from more clarity on how it plans to achieve long-term systemic change and address root causes of identity verification issues in decentralized networks.",
