  "summary": "The Kolektivo Network project aims to empower local communities in emerging and developing countries by creating local impact-driven economies. The project focuses on developing a local stablecoin and integrating it into local fintech solutions to enhance financial inclusion and community development. The application highlights the project's open-source contributions, previous participation in Gitcoin Grants, and plans for further development.",
  "review": "The Kolektivo Network project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's focus on open-source dApps and apps that enhance Web3 accessibility and usability. The project contributes to the growth of the OSS ecosystem by developing open-source contracts, web, and mobile applications. It also addresses significant social impact by empowering local communities through a circular economy model using community stablecoins. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the project's scalability and long-term impact potential, as well as clearer metrics for success and impact measurement.",
