  "summary": "The Kolektivo Network project aims to empower local communities in emerging and developing countries by creating local impact-driven economies. It leverages open-source technology to build a platform that facilitates the organization of local activities, paid in community stablecoins, fostering a circular economy. The project has made significant progress since its last grant, including the development of a web app, mobile app, and a local stablecoin for Curacao and Sint Maarten. The grant will support further development, particularly in integrating local fintech solutions to enhance user experience.",
  "review": "The Kolektivo Network project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's focus on open-source dApps and apps that enhance Web3 accessibility and usability. The project demonstrates a strong commitment to community participation by enabling local stakeholders to create impact-driven economies. It also shows innovation in its approach to using community stablecoins to foster local economies, which aligns with the principles of financial inclusion and social impact.\n\nThe project has a clear plan for further development, including the integration of local fintech solutions, which could significantly enhance the user experience and broaden the project's impact.
