  "summary": "Scout Game is a project that aims to gamify open source contributions by creating a fantasy sport environment for onchain developers. It rewards developers for verified code contributions and partners with ecosystems to provide additional rewards. The project plans to launch on the Base mainnet and use the grant funds for platform development.",
  "review": "The Scout Game project presents an innovative approach to incentivizing open source contributions through gamification. By creating a fantasy sport-like environment, it aims to engage developers and reward them for their contributions to onchain projects. The project has established partnerships with ecosystems like Celo and Good Dollar, which enhances its potential impact on the open source ecosystem. However, the application lacks detailed information on measurable outcomes and sustainability plans, which are crucial for long-term success and alignment with the grant's constitutional principles. The project should provide more evidence of its impact and a clear plan for sustainable revenue generation.",
