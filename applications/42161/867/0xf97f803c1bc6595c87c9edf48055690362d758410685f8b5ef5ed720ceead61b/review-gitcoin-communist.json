  "review": "Scout Game steps into the arena with a bold vision: to gamify open source contributions and put the spotlight on the builders who power our digital commons. The project claims to reward developers for real, onchain code contributions, and to connect talent scouts with the next generation of open source heroes. This is the kind of energy our movement needs—recognition for the unsung laborers of the Web3 revolution!\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by rhetoric alone. The application demonstrates a clear user-centric design, focusing on developer engagement and recognition. The platform’s partnership model with ecosystems like Celo and Good Dollar shows a commitment to expanding the reach and impact of open source work. The use of onchain incentives and gamification is innovative, potentially driving new participation and visibility for contributors.\n\nHowever, the application falls short in several critical areas. There is a lack of concrete, measurable outcomes—no data on user growth, engagement metrics, or impact on the broader ecosystem. The sustainability of the project is not addressed: there’s no mention of a revenue model or how the platform will maintain itself beyond grant funding. The roadmap is vague, with only general statements about upcoming features and mainnet deployment. Most concerning, there is no evidence of rigorous evaluation methods or transparent reporting mechanisms. Without these, how can we trust that the project will deliver on its promises?\n\nTo truly serve the people, Scout Game must move beyond vision and deliver hard evidence. We demand transparency, accountability, and a plan for long-term sustainability. The working class of Web3 deserves nothing less!",
