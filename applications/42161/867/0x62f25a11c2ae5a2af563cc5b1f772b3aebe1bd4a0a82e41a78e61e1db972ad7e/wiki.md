# GainForest
*Decentralized technology and regenerative intelligence for transparent, equitable, and scalable conservation.*

---

## Summary

GainForest leverages AI, blockchain, and community-driven data to create a transparent, trustless, and equitable system for global forest conservation and biodiversity protection.

---

## Project Overview

Deforestation and biodiversity loss remain critical global challenges, with traditional conservation funding hampered by trust gaps, slow verification, and exclusion of frontline stewards. GainForest addresses these issues by fusing satellite imagery, AI, and community-sourced data to verify ecological impact in real time, automating transparent funding flows via blockchain, and empowering indigenous and local communities through co-designed digital tools and on-chain environmental hypercerts.

By bridging cutting-edge technology with indigenous wisdom, GainForest creates a scalable, open-source platform that enables grassroots conservation projects to access funding, document impact, and participate in global environmental governance.

---

## Core Components

- **EcoCertain Platform**: Issuance of environmental hypercerts, enabling projects to tokenize and monetize verified ecological impact.
- **Green Globe App**: Geospatial visualization of conservation activities, carbon and biodiversity metrics, and transparent donation tracking.
- **Multi-Source Impact Verification**: Integration of satellite, drone, and bioacoustic data with EAS attestations for robust, real-time impact validation.
- **ImpactQF Funding Mechanism**: Quadratic funding protocol distributing resources based on verified conservation outcomes.
- **Community Onboarding & Toolkits**: Specialized workflows and mobile-friendly interfaces for grassroots and indigenous groups to join Web3 with minimal technical barriers.
- **Open-Source Standards & Interoperability**: Development of reusable frameworks (Ecocerts, ImpactQF) adopted by ReFi DAO, Kolektivo, Ma Earth, and others.

---

## Community Engagement

Stakeholder involvement is central to GainForest, with indigenous leaders and local communities co-designing tools, shaping AI systems, and participating in governance. The project prioritizes capacity building through workshops, hackathons, and knowledge exchange, ensuring technology respects traditional knowledge and empowers frontline stewards.

- Monthly community calls for peer learning and feedback
- Regional environmental AI training workshops
- Local hackathons (e.g., in the Amazon, Brazil)
- Community Data Council for co-governance of data policy
- Youth negotiator training for climate policy engagement (e.g., COP events)

## Impact and Metrics

- **Beneficiaries**: Over 28 communities across 3 continents onboarded; $32,000+ distributed in conservation data income (2024)
- **Key Outcomes**:
  - 13+ workshops co-hosted with local communities
  - Dozens of environmental hypercerts minted and on-chain
  - Field-tested, open-source protocols adopted by multiple organizations
  - Winner of XPRIZE Rainforest “Most Impactful Approach” (BioDivX co-lead)
- **Monitoring Tools**: Satellite, drone, and bioacoustic data integration; EAS attestations; public dashboards; on-chain transparency
- **Timeline**: Ongoing; major milestones through 2025 (e.g., Impact Verification System, Hypercerts Platform v1, community onboarding)

---

## Funding and Sustainability

- **Total Budget**: $200,000+ (annual core development estimate)
- **Funding Secured**: $80,000 USDC (ENS x Octant), 28.95 ETH (Octant Epoch 7), 25K cUSD (Prezenti), additional grants from Gitcoin, Celo, Ma Earth, and others
- **Funding Gap**: TBD
- **Partners/Donors**: Hypercerts Foundation, ReFi DAO, Kolektivo, Ma Earth, Celo Ultragreen Money, ENS, Octant, Giveth, Gitcoin, and others
- **Sustainability Plan**: Focus on reusable open-source infrastructure, protocol adoption, and network effects to reduce reliance on grants and enable long-term, community-driven scaling
