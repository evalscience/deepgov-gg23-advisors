        "description": "GrantsScope is pioneering the intersection of data science and AI to empower donors in the web3 public goods funding (PGF). \n\n> Our mission? To revolutionize how donors identify and support grantees during PGF rounds.\n\n**QUICK LINKS**\n- [GrantsScope details on prior funding and impact on Karma GAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/grantsscope---grantee-discovery-using-llms)\n\n### The Challenge: \nIn large PGF rounds, where hundreds of grantees vie for attention, the brightest spotlight often falls on those with the strongest marketing. This imbalance creates a cycle where deserving projects may go unnoticed, leading to an uneven distribution of resources and opportunities.\n\n> Information silos create cultural silos\n\n### The Result: \nThis disparity not only places additional burdens on grantees to amplify their visibility but also diverts their focus from creating meaningful impact. As a result, the true potential of PGF is left untapped, and innovation in public goods is stifled.\n\n### Our Solution: GrantsScope\nWe believe in leveling the playing field. GrantsScope harnesses the power of data analytics, machine learning, and advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance project visibility and democratize access to funding. Our experiments are designed to assist donors during quadratic funding rounds on Gitcoin Grants by\n- Providing personalized recommendations, helping donors easily navigate the complexity of PGF rounds.\n- Offering self-discovery tools that empower donors to explore and connect with projects that resonate with their values.\n- Reducing information asymmetry, ensuring donors comprehensively understand the PGF landscape.\n\n### Our Impact: \nHere are the list of apps deployed as part of the project implementation:\n\n- **November 2024**: Deployed a live tool that gave QF donors actionable insights and customizable metrics to evaluate open-source software (OSS) grantees objectively. See an example [here](https://x.com/RohitMalekar/status/1851603242607857946) and a deep dive article [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/data-driven-decision-making-in-quadratic-funding/19752).\n\n- **September 2024**: Deployed app for Octact Community Round 1 for a personalized donation experience that reflects your past contributions and introduces new opportunities. See sample result [here](https://x.com/RohitMalekar/status/1837094115478999409)\n\n- **August 2024**: The GG21 version combined previously experimented features using LLMs and clustering algorithms to offer one-click grantee recommendations to donors. See examples [here](https://x.com/RohitMalekar/status/1822035624649748879), [here](https://x.com/RohitMalekar/status/1822038185368797463), and [here](https://x.com/RohitMalekar/status/1825913801440444903)\n\n- **April 2024**: Grantee [discovery tool](https://all-about-gg20.streamlit.app/) through conversational experience to explore 500+ grantees in GG20 participating in 4 OSS and 5 community rounds. See examples [here](https://x.com/RohitMalekar/status/1786413137220059398), [here](https://x.com/RohitMalekar/status/1785304850814677129), and [here](https://x.com/RohitMalekar/status/1784869975435456620).\n\n- **April 2024**: One-click personalized [Personalized Grantee Recommendations](https://gitcoin-cr3.streamlit.app/) for Citizens Round #3 to re-discover the grantees you’ve supported in the past, explore grantees backed by the community who also champion your favorite projects, and uncover similar but previously unknown grantees\n\n- **March 2024**: From its inception as a Gitcoin Round in late 2021 to its evolution as Climate Coordination Network, over 400 grassroots climate projects have found the support they need to flourish in the climate round - a visual drill-down [here](https://ccn-impact.streamlit.app/).\n\n- **March 2024**: [Clustering-based Discovery tool](https://gp-octant.streamlit.app/) for GreenPill Network x Octant Community Round to guide your exploration of projects by picking a project that sparks your curiosity, discovering similar and distinct projects.\n\n- **January 2024**: PoCs for [Grantee Recommendations Engine](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/concepts-pocs-and-early-results-for-personalized-grantee-recommendations/17469) by tapping into historical donation data and for driving interactive visualization to discover similar projects based on clustering.\n\n- **December 2023**: [Code-created NFT](https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0x4e17da9659cca38ebfd98446d2b404bf94fe9997/1) art to illustrate power of PGF. The art uses a logarithmic scale for brightness to highlight even lesser-known projects, symbolizing their potential to become significant over time.\n\n- **December 2023**: [2023 Wrapped](https://2023-wrapped-gitcoin.streamlit.app/) with Personalized Grantee Recommendations for Gitcoin Donors. Read full description [here](https://x.com/RohitMalekar/status/1742196496152642030?s=20).\n\n- **November 2023**:  [Conversational App](https://all-about-gg19.streamlit.app/) for 500+ projects in GG19 – Program Rounds and Climate Solutions Rounds.

      "description": "GrantsScope is pioneering the intersection of data science and AI to empower donors in the web3 public goods funding (PGF). \n\n> Our mission? To revolutionize how donors identify and support grantees during PGF rounds.\n\n**QUICK LINKS**\n- [GrantsScope details on prior funding and impact on Karma GAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/grantsscope---grantee-discovery-using-llms)\n\n### The Challenge: \nIn large PGF rounds, where hundreds of grantees vie for attention, the brightest spotlight often falls on those with the strongest marketing. This imbalance creates a cycle where deserving projects may go unnoticed, leading to an uneven distribution of resources and opportunities.\n\n> Information silos create cultural silos\n\n### The Result: \nThis disparity not only places additional burdens on grantees to amplify their visibility but also diverts their focus from creating meaningful impact. As a result, the true potential of PGF is left untapped, and innovation in public goods is stifled.\n\n### Our Solution: GrantsScope\nWe believe in leveling the playing field. GrantsScope harnesses the power of data analytics, machine learning, and advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance project visibility and democratize access to funding. Our experiments are designed to assist donors during quadratic funding rounds on Gitcoin Grants by\n- Providing personalized recommendations, helping donors easily navigate the complexity of PGF rounds.\n- Offering self-discovery tools that empower donors to explore and connect with projects that resonate with their values.\n- Reducing information asymmetry, ensuring donors comprehensively understand the PGF landscape.\n\n### Our Impact: \nHere are the list of apps deployed as part of the project implementation:\n\n- **November 2024**: Deployed a live tool that gave QF donors actionable insights and customizable metrics to evaluate open-source software (OSS) grantees objectively. See an example [here](https://x.com/RohitMalekar/status/1851603242607857946) and a deep dive article [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/data-driven-decision-making-in-quadratic-funding/19752).\n\n- **September 2024**: Deployed app for Octact Community Round 1 for a personalized donation experience that reflects your past contributions and introduces new opportunities. See sample result [here](https://x.com/RohitMalekar/status/1837094115478999409)\n\n- **August 2024**: The GG21 version combined previously experimented features using LLMs and clustering algorithms to offer one-click grantee recommendations to donors. See examples [here](https://x.com/RohitMalekar/status/1822035624649748879), [here](https://x.com/RohitMalekar/status/1822038185368797463), and [here](https://x.com/RohitMalekar/status/1825913801440444903)\n\n- **April 2024**: Grantee [discovery tool](https://all-about-gg20.streamlit.app/) through conversational experience to explore 500+ grantees in GG20 participating in 4 OSS and 5 community rounds.
