  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter: Unitap claims to be the ultimate onboarding and loyalty platform for Web3, promising to break down barriers for new users and empower projects to build stronger communities. The project’s stated mission is to make Web3 accessible, understandable, and free for all. That’s a bold vision — but does it deliver on the values of equity, sustainability, and measurable impact that our movement demands?\n\nFirst, the strengths. Unitap’s open-source approach and history of participation in multiple Gitcoin rounds show a commitment to the commons. The platform’s features — Learn Tap, Token Tap, Prize Tap, Gas Tap, and Contribution-Hub — are designed to lower the entry barrier for new users, a critical need in the Web3 space. The project’s focus on zero-to-one educational content and permissionless participation aligns with our principles of collective benefit and public good. The evidence from previous grants, including thousands of users onboarded and active integrations with major networks, demonstrates real traction and utility.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by rhetoric. Where’s the hard data? The application lacks clear, quantifiable metrics for success. How many users have completed onboarding? What’s the retention rate? How do we measure the impact on financial inclusion or social good? Without rigorous, transparent reporting, we risk funding sentiment over substance.\n\nSustainability is another concern. While Unitap’s tools are free for users, there’s no detailed plan for long-term financial sustainability. How will the platform reduce dependency on grants and donations? What’s the revenue model? We need to see a path to self-sufficiency, not just perpetual fundraising.\n\nFinally, while the project claims to serve the global community, there’s little evidence of targeted outreach to underserved or marginalized populations. Equity isn’t just a slogan — it’s a mandate. We need to see concrete strategies for reaching those most excluded from Web3.\n\nIn summary: Unitap is a promising project with a strong open-source ethos and real-world impact, but it must provide hard evidence, a sustainable model, and a clear equity strategy to earn the full trust and support of the people. Let’s demand more than good intentions — let’s demand results!",
