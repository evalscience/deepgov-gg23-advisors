  "summary": "Spinach is a liquid retrofunding platform designed to enhance the growth of decentralized exchange (DEX) total value locked (TVL) by organizing daily liquidity competitions. The project aims to address inefficiencies in builder grants and liquidity incentives by combining them into a single model that rewards measurable impact and encourages long-term commitment. Spinach has demonstrated success in alpha testing on the Celo chain, showing significant TVL growth with limited budgets. The grant funds are intended to support the launch of a minimum viable product (MVP) and subsequent growth campaigns.",
  "review": "The Spinach project presents a novel approach to funding within the crypto ecosystem by focusing on liquidity as a key metric for growth. The use of daily competitions to incentivize liquidity provision is innovative and has shown promising results in initial testing. The project aligns well with the round's focus on open-source dApps and apps that enhance Web3 accessibility and usability. However, the application lacks detailed information on user-centric design and the specific contributions to the Web3 ecosystem. Additionally, while the project demonstrates innovation, it does not explicitly address environmental sustainability, which is a key principle in the model specification.",
