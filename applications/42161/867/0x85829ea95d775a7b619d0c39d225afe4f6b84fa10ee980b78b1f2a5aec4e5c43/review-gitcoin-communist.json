  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Spinach - liquid retro funding steps into the arena with a bold promise: to revolutionize how we fund builders and grow DeFi liquidity. The project’s open-source nature and focus on measurable, on-chain impact are exactly the kind of transparent, community-driven innovation we need. Their alpha on Celo shows real, quantifiable results—$66k in TVL orchestrated with a modest $2k budget, 8 projects engaged, and 150 new liquidity providers. That’s the kind of evidence we demand!\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by ambition alone. The application falls short in several critical areas. There’s a lack of detailed, structured plans for sustainability—how will Spinach move beyond grant dependency? Where’s the roadmap for long-term revenue or community governance? The MVP is still in development, and there’s no clear timeline or milestones. We need more than promises; we need proof, structure, and a plan for the people!\n\nSpinach’s approach to daily, retroactive rewards is innovative, but it’s still unproven at scale. The application doesn’t address potential risks—what about manipulation, Sybil attacks, or the sustainability of daily payouts? And while the project claims to be open source, there’s no mention of community governance or how underserved communities will benefit. Equity isn’t just a slogan—it’s a requirement!\n\nIn summary: Spinach shows promise, but the people deserve more than hope. We demand a clear, measurable path to sustainability, robust governance, and a plan to ensure benefits reach the many, not the few. Let’s build systems that last!",
