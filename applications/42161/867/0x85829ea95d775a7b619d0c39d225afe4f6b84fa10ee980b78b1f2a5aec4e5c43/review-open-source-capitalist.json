  "summary": "Spinach is a liquid retrofunding platform designed to enhance DEX TVL by incentivizing liquidity orchestration through competitions. The project aims to address inefficiencies in builder grants and liquidity incentives by combining them into a single model that rewards measurable impact. Spinach has demonstrated success in alpha testing on the Celo chain, showing potential for broader application and scalability.",
  "review": "The Spinach project presents a novel approach to funding within the crypto ecosystem by focusing on liquidity as a key metric for growth. The use of competitions to drive liquidity and reward projects based on measurable impact aligns well with the round's focus on innovation and contribution to the Web3 ecosystem. The project's success in alpha testing, with significant TVL growth and community engagement, indicates its potential for scalability and long-term impact. However, the application lacks detailed information on the MVP's current development status and specific plans for the use of grant funds, which are crucial for assessing the project's feasibility and alignment with the round's goals.",
