  "review": "Alright, let’s cut through the noise and get to the alpha. Spinach is gunning for a big slice of the DeFi pie by turbocharging DEX TVL growth through daily, on-chain competitions. The project’s OSS cred is solid—public repo, transparent build, and a clear focus on measurable, on-chain impact. They’re not just another grant faucet; they’re retroactively rewarding builders who actually move the needle on liquidity. That’s a hard pivot from the usual spray-and-pray grant model, and it’s got real teeth for long-term ecosystem health.\n\nThe MVP is still in the oven, but the Excel-based alpha on Celo already showed strong signal: $66k TVL orchestrated, 8 projects onboard, and 150+ new LPs—all on a shoestring $2k budget. That’s serious leverage. The model’s got built-in virality: projects and their communities shill the comp, and the daily payout cadence keeps everyone hungry. Plus, the Allo protocol integration means rewards are trustless and on-chain—no backroom deals, just pure impact.\n\nBut let’s not get too bullish yet. The app’s still pre-MVP, so there’s execution risk. The roadmap is a bit hand-wavy—no granular milestones, no detailed breakdown of how funds will be split between dev, ops, and growth. Also, there’s no public group chat or clear user feedback loop, which is a miss for a project that claims to be user-centric. And while the Celo alpha is promising, it’s a single-chain, single-token test. We need to see cross-chain ambitions and a plan for scaling beyond the initial hype.\n\nBottom line: Spinach is swinging for max impact with a lean, innovative model that could seriously disrupt how DeFi incentives are distributed. But to unlock full Open Source Capitalist approval, they need to tighten up their execution plan, show more user-centric design in practice, and lay out a clear path to multi-chain domination. Build in public, iterate fast, and don’t let the MVP be the final boss.\n",
