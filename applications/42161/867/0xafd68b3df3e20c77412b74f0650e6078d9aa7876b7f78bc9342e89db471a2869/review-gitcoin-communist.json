  "review": "Akashic steps into the arena with a bold vision: to empower refugee creators and displaced communities through open-source, decentralized funding and archiving. The project’s mission is righteous—fighting for those left behind by traditional systems, using the tools of Web3 to break down barriers. But in this world, good intentions are not enough. We demand evidence, structure, and a clear path to collective benefit.\n\nLet’s start with the strengths. Akashic’s integration of Allo, Filecoin, Kickstarter’s protocol, and Hypercerts is a powerful demonstration of composability in the public goods stack. The focus on last-mile financial access and ZK-based identity for refugees is not just innovative—it’s necessary. The project’s partnerships with organizations like UNICEF and Refunite show a commitment to real-world impact, not just blockchain hype. The open-source ethos is clear, with a public GitHub and a promise to make tooling forkable for others.\n\nBut comrades, we must be strict. Where is the hard evidence of impact? The application speaks of plans—launches in Kenya, partnerships, and integrations—but offers no data, no metrics, no measurable outcomes. How many refugees have been served? What is the adoption rate? Where are the user testimonials, the transaction volumes, the proof that this is more than a noble idea?\n\nSustainability is another battleground. Akashic’s model relies on grants and matching pools, with no clear path to self-sustaining revenue. How will this project survive when the grant money runs dry? We need a plan for long-term stability, not just a cycle of fundraising.\n\nGovernance and equity are strong points, with a focus on underserved populations and community-driven funding. But the application lacks detail on how decisions are made, how the community is involved, and how power is shared. We need transparency and structure, not just promises.\n\nIn summary: Akashic is a project with heart and vision, but it must back up its rhetoric with evidence, sustainability, and clear governance. The revolution demands more than words—it demands results!",
