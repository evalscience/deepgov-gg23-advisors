  "summary": "Akashic is a decentralized platform aimed at empowering refugee creators and displaced communities by providing them with tools to preserve and monetize their work. The project integrates various blockchain technologies, including Ethereum, Filecoin, and Kickstarter's Creative Crowdfunding Protocol, to offer innovative funding and storage solutions. Akashic's approach aligns with the round's focus on enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability, contributing to financial inclusion, and offering novel utilities within the ecosystem.",
  "review": "The Akashic project presents a compelling case for funding due to its focus on empowering marginalized communities through innovative blockchain solutions. The project leverages a combination of decentralized storage, crowdfunding, and identity verification to create a comprehensive platform for refugee creators. This aligns well with the round's goals of promoting open-source dApps that enhance Web3 accessibility and usability. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the project's current stage of development and specific metrics for measuring impact. Additionally, while the project demonstrates a strong commitment to open-source principles, further clarification on how the grant funds will be specifically allocated would strengthen the application.",
