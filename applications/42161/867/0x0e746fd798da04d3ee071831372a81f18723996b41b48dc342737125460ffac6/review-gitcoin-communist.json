  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Rankify claims to be a tool for the people—a platform to break down the walls of centralized power and put the means of governance back in the hands of the many. The project’s vision is bold: meritocratic, decentralized, and open-source governance for DAOs and online communities. It promises to reward real work, not just loud voices or big wallets. But does it deliver on these promises? Let’s dig in!\n\nFirst, Rankify’s focus on semi-open source models and contribution-based access is a direct strike against the free-rider problem that plagues so many open-source projects. By tying access and rewards to actual participation, it aims to build a system where everyone has skin in the game. This is a step toward justice and sustainability in the open-source world.\n\nThe platform’s features—tokenized expertise, AI-powered collaboration, and transparent, auditable data—are ambitious. The use of “Proof of Competence” as a metric for reputation and reward is a powerful idea, echoing the best of collective action theory (see Ostrom, 1990). The integration of AI for moderation and decision support could help scale governance without falling into the traps of bureaucracy or centralization.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by shiny tech! Where is the hard evidence? The application is heavy on vision and theory, but light on measurable outcomes. Where are the user numbers, the case studies, the data showing that Rankify actually increases participation, equity, or project sustainability? The project is in open beta, but there’s no clear reporting on adoption, retention, or impact. We need more than promises—we need proof!\n\nOn sustainability, Rankify gestures at new funding models and token-gated access, but there’s no detailed revenue plan. How will this project sustain itself without falling back on endless grants? The application lacks a clear, quantifiable path to financial independence.\n\nGovernance is a strong point: the platform is designed to empower communities, not just founders or early adopters. But again, the details are thin. How are decisions made about protocol changes? How is power distributed and checked? The application needs to show us the structures, not just the slogans.\n\nIn summary: Rankify is a project with revolutionary potential, but it must back up its rhetoric with hard evidence, clear metrics, and a concrete plan for sustainability. The working class deserves nothing less than transparency, accountability, and results!",
