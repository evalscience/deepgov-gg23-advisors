  "summary": "Doogly is a donation protocol designed to facilitate cross-chain crypto donations, allowing donors to use any token on supported EVM chains while recipients receive funds in USDC. The project aims to enhance the OSS ecosystem by providing a widget for Dapps to operate across multiple blockchains and tokens, enabling cross-chain contract calls without bridging funds. The grant will be used to improve user experience by integrating a fiat gateway for credit card and PayPal transactions.",
  "review": "The Doogly project presents a compelling case for enhancing the OSS ecosystem by addressing a significant gap in cross-chain crypto donations. The project's ability to facilitate donations across multiple blockchains and tokens is a notable innovation, potentially increasing the reach and impact of Web3 projects. The integration with Allo to optimize fund distribution strategies further strengthens its value proposition. However, the application lacks detailed information on the project's current deployment status and specific metrics for success. Additionally, while the project outlines a roadmap, it could benefit from more detailed timelines and milestones. The proposed use of grant funds to integrate a fiat gateway is a strategic move to enhance user accessibility, aligning with the round's focus on usability and financial inclusion. Overall, Doogly demonstrates strong potential for impact and scalability, but requires more detailed planning and transparency in its execution strategy.",
