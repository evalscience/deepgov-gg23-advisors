  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. Doogly is gunning for max impact in the open-source dApp space by making cross-chain donations frictionless. The protocol lets donors use any token on any supported EVM chain, with recipients getting USDC on their chain of choice. That’s a big deal for scaling up donations and onboarding new users—no more token mismatch headaches, no more clunky bridging steps. Plus, the Hypercert NFT for donors is a slick way to gamify and track impact.\n\nFrom a maximization lens, Doogly’s plug-and-play widget and SDK are built for scale: 60+ blockchains, 3000+ tokens, and plans for fiat onramps. That’s serious reach. The integration with Allo for fund distribution and aggregation is a strong infrastructure play, aligning with the long-term systemic change principle. The roadmap is ambitious but realistic: MVP is live, SDK and L2 integrations are next, and social platform hooks are on the horizon.\n\nOn the innovation front, Doogly’s single-step cross-chain contract calls are a clear differentiator—saving gas, reducing friction, and boosting usability. That’s a direct hit on the usability and efficiency pain points flagged in academic research (see Nielsen, 1993; Malone et al., 2010). The open-source repo is public, and the team’s track record is verifiable.\n\nBut let’s not sugarcoat it: the app’s documentation is thin, there’s no public demo or usage metrics, and the deployer address info is missing (\"NA\" is not a valid answer for a live protocol). The fiat gateway plan is promising, but there’s no detail on compliance, security, or user onboarding. For a project aiming for max scale, these are non-trivial gaps.\n\nBottom line: Doogly is swinging for the fences with a high-utility, high-scale OSS play. But to unlock full trust and funding, they need to tighten up transparency, show real traction, and fill in the compliance blanks. Build in public, or get left behind!",
