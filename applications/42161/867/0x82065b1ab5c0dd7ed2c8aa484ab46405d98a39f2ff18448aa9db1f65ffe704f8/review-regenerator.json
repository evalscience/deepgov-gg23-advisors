  "summary": "Doogly is a donation protocol designed to facilitate cross-chain crypto donations, allowing donors to use any token on supported EVM chains while recipients receive funds in USDC. The project aims to enhance the OSS ecosystem by providing a widget for interoperability across multiple blockchains and enabling cross-chain contract calls without bridging funds first. The grant funds will be used to integrate a fiat gateway for improved user experience. The project aligns with the round's goals by contributing to Web3 ecosystem growth and offering innovative solutions for financial inclusion.",
  "review": "The Doogly project presents a compelling case for enhancing the OSS ecosystem by addressing the challenge of cross-chain crypto donations. By allowing donors to use any token and ensuring recipients receive funds in USDC, Doogly simplifies the donation process and potentially increases the reach and impact of donation programs. The project's integration with Allo and its roadmap for further development, including integration with multiple EVM L2 chains and social platforms, demonstrate a commitment to innovation and ecosystem growth. However, the application lacks detailed information on community participation and environmental sustainability, which are crucial aspects of the model specification. Additionally, the absence of deployer addresses for smart contracts raises concerns about transparency and accountability.",
