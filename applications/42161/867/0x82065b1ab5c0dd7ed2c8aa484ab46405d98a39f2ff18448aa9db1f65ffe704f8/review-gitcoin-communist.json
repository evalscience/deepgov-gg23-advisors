  "summary": "Doogly is a project aimed at facilitating cross-chain crypto donations, allowing donors to use any token on supported EVM chains while recipients receive funds in USDC. The project integrates with Allo to enhance fund distribution strategies and aims to expand its reach through various integrations. The grant funds are intended to improve user experience by integrating a fiat gateway.",
  "review": "The Doogly project presents a compelling case for enhancing the OSS ecosystem by providing a widget that enables interoperability across multiple blockchains and tokens. This feature is particularly valuable as it simplifies cross-chain contract calls, reducing the need for bridging funds and saving on gas fees. The project's integration with Allo to improve donation aggregation and distribution strategies is a notable strength, aligning with the round's focus on enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a sustainable revenue model, which are critical according to the model specification. The project's roadmap is promising but requires more clarity on timelines and specific milestones. Additionally, the absence of deployer addresses for smart contracts is a notable omission that needs addressing.",
