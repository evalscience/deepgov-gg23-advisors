  "summary": "Doogly aims to simplify cross-chain crypto donations and contract calls, enabling broader participation and reducing friction. This aligns with democratizing access to Web3 and fostering collective funding for public goods. However, the lack of transparency regarding deployer addresses and the planned fiat gateway integration raise questions about its commitment to full decentralization and algorithmic liberation.",
  "review": "Doogly presents itself as a tool for the digital proletariat, simplifying the complex dance of cross-chain transactions and liberating users from the tyranny of multiple bridges and exorbitant gas fees. Its widget, a true \"union rep\" for dApps, promises to dismantle the class hierarchies of tech by making interoperability accessible to all, not just the blockchain elite. The vision of \"Kollektiv Proletarian Impact\" through streamlined donations, especially with the Hypercert NFT as a certificate of solidarity, resonates deeply with our principles of re-growing the commons. The active development on GitHub is a testament to \"code as the union rep,\" showing a commitment to open-source praxis.\n\nHowever, comrades, we must scrutinize the shadows within this bright vision. The application's \"NA\" for deployer addresses is a glaring omission, a veil over the very infrastructure meant to be transparent. This lack of verifiable on-chain presence for smart contracts undermines the core tenet of \"algorithmic liberation\" and raises concerns about central points of control. Furthermore, while the integration of a fiat gateway aims to enhance UX, it risks re-introducing the chains of traditional finance, potentially reinforcing capitalist structures rather than abolishing them. We must ensure that the path to liberation does not lead back to the bourgeois banking system. The revolution will be forked, not fiat-funded without radical oversight.",

  "rating": 75,
  "confidence": 4,
  "reasoning": "This evaluation is rooted in the core value framework of Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation. Doogly's efforts to simplify cross-chain interactions and reduce gas fees directly align with Principle 1 (\"dismantle class hierarchies in tech one smart contract at a time\") and Principle 11 (\"algorithmic redistribution of wealth through progressive gas fees\"), making Web3 more accessible and equitable. Its focus on facilitating donations for public goods strongly supports Principle 2 (\"Kollektiv Proletarian Impact\") and Principle 5 (\"de-growth venture capital and re-grow the commons\"), fostering collective ownership and re-growing the digital commons. The open-source nature and active development embody Principle 18 (\"forking code as the new general strike\"). However, the critical omission of deployer addresses in response to a direct question (Principle 19: \"project docs as manifestos and readmes as calls to action\" implies transparency) and the potential centralization risks of the proposed fiat gateway raise significant concerns regarding the project's full commitment to \"Decentralized Liberation.\" These weaknesses necessitate immediate and radical changes to ensure the project truly serves the digital proletariat.",
