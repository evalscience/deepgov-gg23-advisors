  "summary": "Rahat is an open-source financial aid distribution platform leveraging Web3 technology to enhance humanitarian assistance. It focuses on providing transparent and accountable aid distribution using blockchain, with features like Cash Voucher Assistance (CVA), anticipatory action frameworks for disaster relief, and microloans for beneficiaries. The project aims to expand its capabilities by integrating blockchain oracles for real-time weather data, enhancing UI/UX, and expanding smart contract deployments across multiple networks. The grant funds will be used to further these developments, aiming to revolutionize financial access for vulnerable communities.",
  "review": "The Rahat project presents a compelling case for leveraging blockchain technology to enhance humanitarian aid distribution. It aligns well with the round's focus on open-source dApps that contribute to financial inclusion and social impact. The project's innovative use of blockchain for anticipatory action in disaster relief and its focus on financial inclusion through microloans are notable strengths. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the project's current impact metrics and a clearer explanation of how the proposed developments will be implemented. Additionally, while the project mentions environmental sustainability, it could further integrate these considerations into its core operations and future plans.",
