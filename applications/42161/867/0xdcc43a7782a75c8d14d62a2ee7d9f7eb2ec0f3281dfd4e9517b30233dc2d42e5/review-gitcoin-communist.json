  "summary": "Rahat is an open-source financial aid distribution platform leveraging Web3 technology to enhance humanitarian assistance. It focuses on providing transparent and accountable aid distribution using blockchain, with features like Cash Voucher Assistance (CVA), anticipatory action frameworks for disaster relief, and microloans for beneficiaries. The project aims to expand its capabilities by integrating blockchain oracles for real-time data, enhancing UI/UX, and expanding smart contract deployments across multiple networks. The grant funds will be used to further these developments, aiming to revolutionize financial access for vulnerable communities.",
  "review": "The Rahat project presents a compelling case for enhancing the OSS ecosystem through its innovative use of blockchain technology in humanitarian aid. The application highlights several strengths, including its focus on transparency, scalability, and inclusivity. The use of blockchain oracles for anticipatory action and the integration of multi-channel communication methods are particularly noteworthy. However, the application could benefit from more detailed evidence of past successes and a clearer sustainability model. Additionally, while the project demonstrates potential for significant social impact, it would be strengthened by more rigorous evaluation methods and transparent reporting of outcomes. The project aligns well with the round's eligibility criteria, particularly in terms of contributing to Web3 ecosystem growth and promoting financial inclusion.",
