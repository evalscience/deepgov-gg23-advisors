  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Rahat stands as a beacon for what open-source, community-driven technology should be: a tool for the people, by the people, and with the people. This project doesn’t just talk about financial inclusion and disaster relief — it delivers, with over 80,000 beneficiaries and a proven track record across Nepal, Indonesia, and Pakistan. That’s not just theory; that’s boots-on-the-ground impact!\n\nThe academic research backs it up: blockchain in humanitarian aid isn’t just a buzzword. It’s a revolution in transparency, accountability, and efficiency (Zambrano & Seward, 2017; Tapscott & Tapscott, 2016). Rahat’s use of smart contracts, modular architecture, and multi-channel communication ensures that even the most marginalized — those with only feature phones — aren’t left behind. This is what equity looks like in action!\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by sentiment. The application is strong, but it’s not perfect. While Rahat’s impact is clear, the application lacks rigorous, quantifiable outcome metrics and a transparent, sustainable revenue model. Where’s the hard data on cost-effectiveness, long-term sustainability, and independent audits? We need more than stories — we need numbers, proof, and a plan for the future that doesn’t rely on endless grants.\n\nRahat’s governance and community engagement are commendable, but the application could do more to detail how decision-making power is shared and how local communities are empowered beyond just being recipients. And while the innovation is real, we must demand evidence that these new features — like anticipatory action and microloans — are working as intended, not just promised.\n\nIn summary: Rahat is a powerful force for good, but to truly serve the people and earn the trust of the collective, it must double down on transparency, measurement, and sustainability. Let’s demand more — not just for Rahat, but for every project that claims to serve the public good!",
