It focuses on providing transparent and accountable aid distribution using blockchain, with features like Cash Voucher Assistance (CVA), anticipatory action frameworks for disaster relief, and microloans for beneficiaries. The project aims to expand its capabilities by integrating blockchain oracles for real-time data, enhancing UI/UX, and expanding smart contract deployments across multiple networks. The grant funds will be used to further these developments, aiming to maximize impact in humanitarian aid and demonstrate blockchain's potential for financial inclusion.",
  "review": "The Rahat project presents a compelling case for leveraging blockchain technology to enhance humanitarian aid distribution. Its focus on transparency, accountability, and financial inclusion aligns well with the round's goals of enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability. The project's innovative use of anticipatory action frameworks and blockchain oracles for disaster relief demonstrates a forward-thinking approach to humanitarian assistance. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the project's current impact metrics and a clearer roadmap for achieving its stated goals. Additionally, while the project emphasizes scalability and broad impact, it should provide more evidence of its ability to achieve these outcomes effectively.",
