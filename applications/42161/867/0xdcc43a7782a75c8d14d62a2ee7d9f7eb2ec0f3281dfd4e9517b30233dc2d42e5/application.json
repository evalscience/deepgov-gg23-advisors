        "description": "Rahat is a financial access platform designed to facilitate cash voucher assistance (CVA) projects, primarily in the humanitarian sector. It enables organizations to distribute aid in the form of blockchain-based tokens, providing transparency and traceability in fund distribution. Through Rahat, humanitarian organizations can set up projects, send funds, and distribute them to beneficiaries, ensuring that the flow of funds is securely tracked.\nAs a certified Digital Public Good, Rahat is dedicated to promoting our open source solution to build financial inclusion and resilience across marginalized communities. We have positively impacted over 20,000 vulnerable beneficiaries across Nepal, Indonesia, and Pakistan, and have provided essential digital and financial literacy support to over 3,000+ individuals.\n\nRahat is also expanding its capabilities with innovative features such as anticipatory action for disaster relief and microloans for beneficiaries.\n\nAnticipatory action is a proactive approach that leverages weather data to provide early intervention in disaster-prone areas. Rahat will integrate blockchain oracles to collect and process weather forecasts, particularly focusing on floods. Based on predictive models, the platform will trigger the early release of aid to vulnerable communities even before a disaster strikes. This partial distribution of funds allows beneficiaries to take necessary preventive actions, such as securing food, water, or shelter, to minimize the impact of the disaster. Once the flood occurs and is verified by evaluators or inspectors, the remaining funds will be released, ensuring that affected communities receive timely support for recovery. By using predictive data, Rahat’s anticipatory action system enhances preparedness and reduces the devastating effects of floods on marginalized populations.\n\nIn addition to anticipatory action, microloans are another key feature Rahat is aiming to implement for its beneficiaries. This service will provide access to small, flexible loans that can be used to meet immediate financial needs. The microloans are designed to promote financial inclusion, helping beneficiaries build credit histories while also offering a safety net in times of need. With user-friendly terms and conditions, the microloan feature will encourage responsible borrowing and empower individuals to invest in small-scale projects, grow their businesses, or cover essential expenses. This expansion of financial services contributes to long-term financial independence and resilience, enabling beneficiaries to improve their economic standing over time",

      "description": "# Rahat: Empowering Financial Resilience for the Last Billion\n\n**Rahat**, developed by Rumsan, is an open-source, blockchain-based financial access platform that aims to support the last billion in building financial resilience before the onset of a climate disaster. With Rahat, humanitarian organizations can set up projects, distribute funds, and ensure secure tracking of financial flows.\n\nCertified as a **Digital Public Good**, Rahat is committed to promoting financial inclusion across marginalized communities. To date, we've positively impacted over **80,000 vulnerable beneficiaries** and provided essential digital and financial literacy support to over **8,000 individuals**.\n\n## Our Mission\n\nRahat leverages mobile phones and blockchain technology to meet critical financial needs, particularly in regions where access to financial services is limited. Rahat focuses on three key pillars:\n\n### 1. Financial Response and Recovery\nRahat ensures efficient and transparent access to humanitarian aid, with both **Cash and Voucher Assistance and Anticipatory Action**. By using blockchain-based tokens, agencies can send cash, food, and service vouchers directly to beneficiaries’ phones. Smart contracts automate the delivery of vouchers and early warning messages (via voice and text) triggered by specific parameters, enabling proactive interventions before disasters strike.\n\n### 2. Financial and Digital Literacy\nWe conduct tailored awareness campaigns and training programs to empower local communities with the knowledge and skills to make informed financial decisions. Our efforts narrow the gap in access to opportunities and foster economic empowerment.\n\n### 3. Financial Resilience\nBeyond seasonal aid, Rahat works to break generational poverty by offering microinsurance for smallholder farmers, ensuring instant payouts triggered by predefined climate risk triggers. This is made possible by smart contracts that streamline aid delivery, even for unbanked beneficiaries who can use their feature phones as digital wallets for easy cashouts.\n\n## Why Rahat?\n\nRahat offers accessible, scalable, and trustworthy financial solutions. Its modular design allows for easy adaptation to diverse community needs. Through third-party API integrations, Rahat seamlessly interfaces with other systems, enhancing functionality and customization. Blockchain technology ensures transparent, secure transactions, fostering trust and accountability. Rahat's geographic scalability makes it easy to expand to new regions, while its low-tech options ensure accessibility for vulnerable populations.\n\nBy promoting inclusivity and leveraging technology, Rahat is enabling financial empowerment and building resilience in communities that need it most.\n\n**Learn more at:**  \n[rahat.io](https://rahat.io)\n",
