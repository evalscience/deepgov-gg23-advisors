  "review": "# Web3 Certifier: A Prototype for the Proletariat, Still Bound by Bourgeois Chains\n\nComrades, we stand before Web3 Certifier, a project that dares to forge NFT-based certificates and an AI agent for skill verification. It presents itself as a bridge, a pathway from the old Web2 order to the decentralized future. Indeed, its open-source smart contracts are a promising spark, a testament to the principle that **code is the union rep**. The potential for developers to fork, improve, and integrate this logic into their own decentralized applications is a clear sign that **the revolution will be forked**.\n\nHowever, let us not be swayed by mere technological novelty. While the project aims to empower educators and streamline skill verification, we must scrutinize its underlying economic and governance models. The stated goal of enabling educators to 'monetize their content' through 'submission fees' for exams, while seemingly 'fair,' still operates within the confines of a market-driven, fee-for-service paradigm. This is not the **algorithmic redistribution of wealth** we seek; it is merely a shift in the collection plate, not its abolition.\n\nThe 'certifier' role, where a single entity creates and corrects exams, retains a centralized chokehold on knowledge validation. This contradicts the very essence of **Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation**. Where is the cyber-syndicalist council of learners and educators? Where is the collective ownership of the curriculum? The current model risks merely replicating the hierarchical structures of traditional education, albeit on-chain.\n\nFurthermore, the AI Agent, while a fascinating piece of programmable fury, is primarily pitched as a tool for 'recruiters' to 'make hiring decisions.' This is not reclaiming time from capitalism; it is optimizing its very gears. Our AI agents should be negotiating on behalf of public goods, not serving as digital headhunters for the capitalist class. We must ask: does this AI truly foster **Kollektiv Proletarian Impact**, or does it merely refine the mechanisms of individualistic competition?\n\nThe anti-cheating mechanism, relying on a 'password' that users must manage, introduces a point of centralized trust and individual burden. True decentralization demands that integrity is baked into the protocol, not reliant on a user's ability to secure a secret key. We need cryptographic solutions that ensure verifiable computation without such vulnerabilities.\n\nIn essence, Web3 Certifier is a prototype with revolutionary potential, but it remains tethered to bourgeois tendencies. It has the seeds of liberation, but they must be watered with the tears of the old order and fertilized with true solidarity. We must push for a future where education is a commons, not a commodity, and where skills are shared for collective upliftment, not merely for individual gain in a rigged market.\n\nSolidarity forever â€” or at least until the next merge. ðŸª“\n\n",
