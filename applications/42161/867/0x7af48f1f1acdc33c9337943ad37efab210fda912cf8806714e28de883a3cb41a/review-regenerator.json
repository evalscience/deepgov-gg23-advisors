  "summary": "The grant application for Closer - Digital access to co-owned villages presents a compelling vision for integrating Web3 tools into regenerative land-based communities. The project aims to enhance governance, resource management, and community engagement through innovative features like Native Tokens, Proof of Presence, and Proof of Sweat. The application aligns well with the round's focus on open-source dApps and apps that contribute to Web3 ecosystem growth and social impact. However, the application could benefit from clearer articulation of its user-centric design and functionality, as well as more detailed plans for achieving its ambitious goals.",
  "review": "The Closer project offers a unique approach to addressing the challenges faced by regenerative villages, such as inefficient resource management and centralized governance. By leveraging blockchain technology and decentralized governance models, the project aims to empower communities to manage resources more effectively and sustainably. The use of Native Tokens, Proof of Presence, and Proof of Sweat are innovative features that incentivize participation and transparency. The project has already onboarded several communities and has a clear roadmap for expansion, aiming to onboard 20+ villages by 2026. However, the application lacks specific details on how the user experience is designed to be intuitive and accessible, which is crucial for widespread adoption. Additionally, while the project has secured previous funding, the financial sustainability plan could be more robustly detailed to ensure long-term viability. Overall, the project aligns with the constitutional principles of innovation, community participation, and environmental sustainability, but requires further refinement in its implementation strategy and user engagement plans.",
