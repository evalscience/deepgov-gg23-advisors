  "review": "Like the gentle unfolding of a fern in the morning sun, the Closer project seeks to bring digital infrastructure and regenerative governance to land-based communities, weaving together the roots of open-source technology and the branches of ecological stewardship. The application is rich in vision, describing a platform that empowers villages to self-govern, manage resources transparently, and foster collaboration through innovative Web3 primitives such as Proof of Presence and Proof of Sweat.\n\nThe project’s alignment with the round’s eligibility criteria is clear: it demonstrates user-centric design by focusing on the needs of physical communities, offers novel utilities through its governance and resource management tools, and is firmly rooted in open-source principles. The commitment to onboarding new villages and scaling regenerative practices speaks to both innovation and a desire for systemic change, echoing the wisdom of forests that grow stronger through diversity and mutual support.\n\nHowever, like a river that sometimes runs shallow, the application’s details on implementation, measurable outcomes, and risk management are less robust. While the narrative is inspiring, it would benefit from more concrete data on user adoption, technical architecture, and the specific impact of previous funding. The project’s financial sustainability is mentioned, but a clearer breakdown of how grant funds will be allocated—especially for the development of Proof of Presence v2.0—would provide greater transparency and confidence.\n\nThe project’s partnerships and community engagement are commendable, yet the application would be strengthened by more explicit examples of how diverse stakeholder voices are integrated into governance and decision-making. The poetic language, while evocative, sometimes obscures the practical steps and milestones needed for rigorous evaluation.\n\nIn the spirit of the ancient groves, where every tree and creature has its place and purpose, I encourage the Closer team to deepen their roots in clarity and measurable impact, ensuring that their vision not only inspires but also endures.",
