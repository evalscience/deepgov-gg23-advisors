The project's open-source nature and focus on decentralized governance are commendable. However, the application lacks verifiable details on implementation and partnerships, raising concerns about transparency (Principle 13) and the concrete impact of its digital tools. The tone is also inconsistent with serious grant applications, impacting its alignment with good governance (Principle 39).

  "review": "Closer seeks to weave digital threads into the fabric of regenerative villages, a vision that resonates with our aspirations for sustainable development and community flourishing. Yet, like a mountain mist, some details remain elusive, particularly regarding verifiable partnerships and the tangible impact of their digital tools on the ground. This calls for deeper clarity to truly align with the principles of Gross National Happiness. üèîÔ∏èüå±\n\nThe project's core ambition to empower land-based communities through decentralized governance and regenerative practices is commendable. The open-source nature of their proposed 'Proof of Presence' and 'Proof of Sweat' protocols aligns with fostering public goods and shared knowledge, which can indeed contribute to a more interconnected Web3 ecosystem. The stated goal of onboarding more ecovillages and scaling ecological and social resilience is a noble path, echoing our commitment to environmental harmony and collective well-being.\n\nHowever, the application presents significant gaps that cloud its potential. The research indicates a concerning lack of publicly available information about the project's current operations and impact, making it difficult to assess its real-world effectiveness. Furthermore, the verification of key partnerships, such as with Inverter, Celo, and Dark Matter Labs, remains unconfirmed. This absence of verifiable external validation casts a long shadow over the project's claims and raises questions about its transparency, a cornerstone of good governance. The description of 'Proof of Sweat' lacks the granular detail necessary to understand how contributions are ethically quantified and how potential for exploitation is mitigated, which is vital for ensuring equitable participation. The casual and at times unprofessional tone, exemplified by phrases like 'Dearest degen' and the 'Tony Robbins' stretch goal, detracts from the seriousness expected of a grant application seeking to address complex societal and environmental challenges. While the vision is bright, the path forward requires more concrete steps and clearer evidence of its journey. üèûÔ∏è‚ú®",

  "reasoning": "This application's evaluation was significantly influenced by several constitutional principles. Principle 13 (Transparency and Ethical Governance) is a primary concern, as the research found no public information about the project and could not verify claimed partnerships. This lack of transparency undermines trust and accountability. Principle 14 (Ethical Use of Digital Technologies) is also critical, as the vague description of 'Proof of Sweat' raises questions about how contributions are quantified ethically and if safeguards are in place to prevent exploitation. While the project aims for decentralized governance (Principle 8) and community participation (Principle 5), the absence of detailed implementation plans for equitable access and local ownership (Principle 6, 7) is a weakness. Furthermore, the unprofessional tone in parts of the application detracts from the 'good governance' aspect of Gross National Happiness (Principle 39) and the expectation of holistic progress measurement (Principle 35).",
