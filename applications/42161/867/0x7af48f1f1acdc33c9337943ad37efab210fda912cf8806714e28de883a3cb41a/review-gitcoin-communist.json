  "summary": "The Closer project aims to create a decentralized platform for co-owned regenerative villages, integrating Web2 and Web3 tools to enhance governance, resource management, and community engagement. The project focuses on developing the \"Proof of Presence\" protocol to onboard regenerative villages and scale the movement through place-based communities. The application highlights the project's open-source nature, previous funding, and partnerships, aiming to contribute to the Web3 ecosystem by promoting decentralized governance and ecological restoration.",
  "review": "The Closer project presents a compelling vision for transforming land-based communities into socio-economic hubs through decentralized governance and innovative blockchain applications. The project aligns with the round's eligibility criteria by demonstrating user-centric design, contributing to Web3 ecosystem growth, and presenting innovative use cases. The project's focus on open-source principles and ethical standards further strengthens its application. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and quantifiable results, which is crucial for aligning with the model specification's emphasis on evidence and measurement principles. Additionally, while the project outlines a sustainable revenue model, more clarity on long-term financial sustainability and scalability is needed. The governance model is well-articulated, promoting community engagement and equity, but the application could benefit from more detailed plans for implementation and resource allocation. Overall, the project shows promise but requires more rigorous evaluation methods and transparent reporting of outcomes to fully align with the model specification.",
