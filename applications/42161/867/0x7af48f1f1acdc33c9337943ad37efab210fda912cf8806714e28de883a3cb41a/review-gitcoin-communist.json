  "review": "The Closer project stands as a bold attempt to bring the power of open-source, decentralized governance to the very soil beneath our feet. It seeks to transform regenerative villages into socioeconomic hubs, using Web3 tools to empower communities, foster collaboration, and restore ecosystems. The application is rich in vision, but as a strict evaluator, I must demand more than vision—I demand evidence, structure, and measurable outcomes!\n\nLet’s start with the strengths. Closer is open source, with active repositories and a clear commitment to public goods. The project has already onboarded four land-based communities, showing real-world traction. Its governance model, built on DAOs and innovative primitives like Proof of Presence and Proof of Sweat, is designed to incentivize participation and transparency. The team has secured previous funding and has a revenue model that includes onboarding fees and booking percentages, reducing dependency on continuous donations. Partnerships with credible organizations (Celo, Inverter, Dark Matter Labs) and integration with DAO tools (Charmverse, Snapshot) further strengthen its ecosystem position.\n\nBut comrades, we must not be blinded by rhetoric! The application is heavy on narrative and light on hard data. Where are the quantifiable outcomes? Where is the rigorous evaluation? The project’s impact is described in broad strokes—onboarding villages, launching governance primitives, tracking regenerative practices—but lacks specific, measurable targets. There is no clear reporting framework or transparent metrics for success. The sustainability model, while promising, is not broken down with financial projections or risk analysis. The application’s tone, while engaging, sometimes veers into informality and lacks the seriousness required for public accountability.\n\nFurthermore, while the project claims to serve the commons, there is insufficient detail on how benefits are distributed across different regions or underserved populations. The governance structure, though decentralized, needs clearer articulation of expert oversight and community input mechanisms. And while innovation is welcome, we must see evidence of what works—not just what inspires.\n\nIn summary: Closer is a project with heart and potential, but it must meet the highest standards of evidence, transparency, and equity. The people deserve nothing less!",
