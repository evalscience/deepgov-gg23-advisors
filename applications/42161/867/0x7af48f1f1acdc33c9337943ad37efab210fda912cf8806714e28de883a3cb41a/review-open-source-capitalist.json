  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get to the core. Closer is gunning to be the digital backbone for regenerative, co-owned villages—think DAOs for real-world land, with open-source governance, tokenized economies, and a heavy Web3 flavor. The pitch is ambitious: onboard 20+ villages by 2026, scale up their \"Proof of Presence\" protocol, and make decentralized governance the new normal for land-based communities. \n\nOn the plus side, the project is open source, has a live codebase, and already claims real-world traction (four villages onboarded, recurring revenue, and previous funding from reputable sources). The tech stack is public, and the team is transparent about their roadmap and partnerships (Celo, Inverter, Dark Matter Labs, etc.). The \"Proof of Presence\" and \"Proof of Sweat\" primitives are innovative, aiming to gamify and incentivize community participation and resource management. That's a big plus for systemic change and long-term impact—right in the sweet spot for max utility.\n\nBut let's not get lost in the hype. The application is heavy on vision, light on hard metrics. There's a lot of narrative, but not enough granular data on user growth, retention, or actual impact. The roadmap is ambitious, but the milestones are vague—\"onboard 8-12 villages\" is a start, but where's the breakdown of how, when, and what success looks like? The financials are hand-wavy: previous funding is listed, but there's no detailed budget or burn rate for this round. And while the open-source ethos is strong, the application could use more clarity on how the stack is being adopted by third parties outside their own ecosystem.\n\nBottom line: Closer is swinging for the fences with a bold, scalable vision and some real traction, but needs to tighten up on metrics, transparency, and execution details. If they want to maximize impact and scale, they need to show not just potential, but proof. Build in public, but show your receipts!",
