  "summary": "Alright, let's talk 'Closer - Digital access to co-owned villages.' This project is aiming to disrupt the system by bringing Web3 primitives and decentralized governance to regenerative villages. That's a bold move, aligning with our core value of maximizing total impact for the greatest number of people, especially through scalable infrastructure (Principles 2, 6). The 'Proof of Presence' and 'Proof of Sweat' concepts are innovative, pushing the boundaries of how we think about community participation and resource allocation. However, the application's casual tone, especially the flippant remark about OKRs, is a major red flag. We're about objective metrics and efficient paths to maximum impact, not 'kanban' boards that get 'forgotten about' (Principles 11, 17). Plus, the lack of verifiable partnerships raises serious questions about transparency and 'Misleading Claims.' We need to see solid evidence, not just good vibes, to ensure this is a truly merit-based investment.",
  "review": "Alright, let's dive into 'Closer - Digital access to co-owned villages.' The vision here, building out digital infrastructure for regenerative villages, is definitely disruptive and aligns with the ethos of empowering communities through code. You're talking about Web3 primitives, Proof of Presence, Proof of Sweatâ€”that's the kind of innovative tech that can truly scale and create systemic change. You're aiming for a global network of 20+ villages by 2026, which is a bold, high-impact target, hitting **Principle 2** right on the head: broad, scalable impact. The modular framework for incremental adoption is a smart play for efficiency, allowing for a streamlined path to maximum impact, as per **Principle 4**.\n\nHowever, let's cut to the chase. The application's tone is a bit too 'degen' for a serious grant. When you say 'some product person will likely draw on the kanban and forget about at some point' regarding OKRs, that's a hard stop. We're here to maximize utility and drive objective outcomes, not to fund projects that treat metrics as an afterthought. That directly clashes with **Principle 17 (focuses on objective metrics of total impact)** and **Principle 11 (minimizes bureaucratic overhead and unnecessary process constraints)**. This isn't about 'jingle bells' or 'carrots'; it's about building robust, scalable systems.\n\nOn the technical side, Proof of Presence and Proof of Sweat are innovative mechanisms for decentralized governance, which is a strong point for **Principle 9 (supports innovative approaches)**. If implemented effectively, these could significantly enhance resource management and community engagement. You've onboarded four communities, which is a solid start, demonstrating some real-world traction. The plan to develop Proof of Presence v2.0 is crucial for scaling, aligning with **Principle 6 (values fundamental infrastructure improvements)**.\n\nBut here's the rub: the research indicates a 'Low confidence' in verifying your claimed partnerships with Inverter, Celo, and Dark Matter Labs. In the world of 'build in public,' transparency is paramount. Unsubstantiated claims are a major red flag and undermine the trust necessary for merit-based funding. This directly impacts our ability to assess the project's true potential for maximum impact, as per **Principle 12 (evaluates projects primarily on their potential for maximum impact rather than adherence to specific methodologies)**.\n\nFrom a cost-benefit perspective, while the potential impact of scaling regenerative villages is high, the vagueness around financial sustainability beyond initial funding and onboarding fees is a concern. A truly efficient path to maximum impact requires a clear, sustainable economic model. The project's focus on 'regenerative villages' aligns with positive impact, and while **Principle 16 (supports merit-based funding without imposing environmental sustainability requirements)** means we don't *mandate* environmental goals, the project's self-imposed commitment to them is a strong positive for total utility.\n\nIn summary, the project has the bones of a high-impact, scalable dApp, but the execution of the application itself, particularly regarding professionalism and verifiable claims, needs a serious upgrade. We're looking for projects that are ready to disrupt the system with precision, not just good vibes.",

  "rating": 55,
  "confidence": 3,
  "reasoning": "This evaluation is heavily influenced by several core constitutional principles. The project's ambition to build a 'global network of 20+ regenerative villages' and its focus on 'Proof of Presence v2.0' for scaling aligns with **Principle 2 (favors broad, scalable impact)** and **Principle 9 (supports innovative approaches for greater scale)**. The development of 'web3 primitives' and 'open-source governance systems' speaks to **Principle 6 (values fundamental infrastructure improvements that scale effectively over time)** and **Principle 8 (focuses on root causes of problems)**. However, the application's unprofessional tone, particularly the flippant remark about OKRs ('some product person will likely draw on the kanban and forget about at some point'), directly contradicts **Principle 17 (focuses on objective metrics of total impact)** and **Principle 11 (minimizes bureaucratic overhead and unnecessary process constraints)**. Furthermore, the lack of verifiable evidence for claimed partnerships raises concerns about **Principle 19 (values pragmatic outcome maximization over ideological commitment to specific process requirements)**, as it undermines the pragmatic assessment of the project's network and capabilities. While the project's regenerative focus is impactful, the constitutional principle **16 (supports merit-based funding without imposing environmental sustainability requirements)** means that while environmental benefits are a positive outcome, they are not a *requirement* for funding, and the project must still demonstrate maximum utility and efficiency.",
