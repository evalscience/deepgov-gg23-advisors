  "summary": "The Closer project aims to provide digital infrastructure to community-driven land projects, transforming them into socioeconomic hubs through both Web2 and Web3 tools. It focuses on decentralized governance and resource management using blockchain-based tools like Native Tokens, Proof of Presence, and Proof of Sweat. The project seeks funding to further develop its \"Proof of Presence\" protocol v2.0, aiming to onboard more regenerative villages and scale the regenerative movement.",
  "review": "The Closer project presents a compelling vision of integrating Web3 tools into land-based communities to enhance governance and resource management. The use of innovative concepts like Proof of Presence and Proof of Sweat aligns well with the round's focus on novel utilities and services. The project demonstrates a clear contribution to the Web3 ecosystem by promoting decentralized governance and ecological restoration. However, the application could benefit from more detailed explanations of how these tools will be implemented and their potential impact on the broader ecosystem. Additionally, while the project has a strong focus on community-driven initiatives, it should ensure that its approach aligns with the maximization principles outlined in the model specification, particularly in terms of scalability and long-term systemic change.",
