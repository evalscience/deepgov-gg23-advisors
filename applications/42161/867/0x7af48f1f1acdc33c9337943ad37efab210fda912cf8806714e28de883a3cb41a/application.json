These challenges hinder scaling and sustainable growth. Closer offers decentralized governance via Native Tokens, Proof of Presence, and Proof of Sweat, incentivizing active participation and transparent resource management. The platform enables non-Web3 villages to digitize their operations, paving the way for scalable, community-led ecological restoration.\n\nDecentralized governance ensures that villages are self-managed, responsive, and adaptive, promoting long-term sustainability while allowing local decision-making to drive restoration efforts.\n\nYalla, LFG regens.\n\nWhat is \"Proof of Presence\"? üèïÔ∏è\n--------------------------------\n\nProof of Presence is our game-changing feature that tracks and rewards your active participation within a community. The more time you spend, the more Presence you collect, and the more influence you have in decision-making. It's your passport to a richer, more connected community experience.\n\nCheck out the Github repo here: [CloserDAO Proof of Presence](https://github.com/closerdao/proof-of-presence) üëá\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfCdNum8gJJU-CKt07_EqG0Yy1yjNqlAOyLy3RkJBo5_-kisHLdSs69l0lrb36msI8DZwJf0_dWT9JLCOEEHbdyUvUF2IR7rCmzxUhCp22rW7msNM6-qyGILeoIeS_NHN3sEZcVWNex1FjFOiMOmjOnUyh0?key=dxSOztJW656jhIMe5VQAsg)\n\nWhat is \"Proof of Sweat\"? üòÖ\n----------------------------\n\nProof of Sweat is an innovative approach that rewards members for their active contributions to a project. By quantifying the work and effort put in, it grants members greater influence and recognition within the community. This system ensures that the more you contribute, the more impact you have, fostering a more engaged and productive environment.¬†\n\nHere's how it all fits into the bigger picture of web3 access, governance, housing & infrastructure and natural capital assets (for all you forest lovers). üå≤\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcpW0ooL31Dr8ZD1Ke11JJwQldWn15SJdax8KMg0yUNLbBss3X86tcS6OYNMk9Jpvgx1E28cIcOtHix8vWWhzJb_ni5-_zsU8NF5fzk1S_qmFwBtuo1iOqiK8hnktCceFBQVnhq1slJtdK0wd_gIxtMVfqs?key=dxSOztJW656jhIMe5VQAsg)\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcn6_4YUnDybtXg8zwNQtIAkjhwognDMUz30TEr5DZ5mkJbIBhBl2o8MbAogHcFkkpAWnRBTtJq8n0x1bC1kidnueWE5v65kg_f4s83TrJRqD11f4KZ9hU2P1L_SjTYpXoFZ31rAEeK9Phy1vyyeoGp9A8?key=dxSOztJW656jhIMe5VQAsg)![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdtslVGK2kOX9ir7iTQL9IMEFdNnbQRTXA5rypdJ6QOIiu1LkgZzEFi9IgpXe8egkmV7O-PBBxf1rwqFDnwWkn1-17vDQv65-QA32JLWFAsSisYRFYfsD7JbGOac7-BYHeMUGI8YX6T7PhpZoHQLSY5EkyC?key=dxSOztJW656jhIMe5VQAsg)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ndApp Round Fundraising Objectives üí∏\n------------------------------------\n\nDearest degen, by donating to Closer thy shall support the following metrics and OKRs that some product person will likely draw on the kanban and forget about at some point.\n\nShort-Term Goals (6-12 months)\n\n-   Closer will onboard 8--12 villages, implement the next iteration of governance, and deploy Native Tokens for resource management.\n\n-   Launch governance primitives across pilot villages.\n\n-   Establish regenerative practices with blockchain metrics tracking progress across the Closer network.\n\nStretch goal(s)\n\n-   Implement event distribution integrations with partners like Social Layer, Agartha, etc.\n\n-   Get Tony Robbins to stay in one of our villages üòá\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcPo_coeCDORspDMVALbfgj2b44-gNm4Idw7kAZbY4oM07x-PPVNM-5zZSJ-5wo4WXgMrhhlrs_dRg4nzxsnDbmI28XP7IdjKTz-W9gi3xhNnbPUUGjcaGZIHUUveXdC6kFKZ1M41GUSq9SaRZGQOfQXP6G?key=dxSOztJW656jhIMe5VQAsg)\n\nOur Journey ahead üöÄ\n--------------------\n\nCloser aims to build a global network of 20+ regenerative villages by the end of 2026, scaling ecological and social resilience using open source software.\n\nHopefully no one blows up the planet before then... ü§Ø\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfHS1EN9_MHehUpuJF6QM3549bSvVWN4YTfi5xoSKokFnpz8zaIriM9XIU1196Fohb--8XGn6kR5IVVH3VvU5NR_zs0M3fLvXa4XQIKwPtzT8BelIEr9Xzn6_g-vHtbi0V5UWHRX3tSXQkSKnqrVShWgmTZ?key=dxSOztJW656jhIMe5VQAsg)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc7R44zyUy3tHgny8nGcYw58tYQ2lwEeBy-WJk7HVNXkztktuOS9k6xQFxAtnfRyMR_2f7EKqElJug4s22tG4J36JijDrE9hS4NHhGmM_1RTGl0rxTlBZoxwPCq62z5HWdK8YNNcwOuestVd1OTYGg10ee_?key=dxSOztJW656jhIMe5VQAsg)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPartnerships, Community Engagement & Governance üèõÔ∏è\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nLet's be honest. We like DAOs.. and community, and carrots. ü•ï Some people call us sheep üêë. Do sheep like carrots? Not sure, but we have some serious decentralization and governance jingle bells going on.\n\nCloser's governance model is built on DAOs, enabling decentralized decision-making through Proof of Presence and Proof of Sweat. These systems ensure that members gain governance influence based on time spent in the community and contributions made. Native Tokens incentivize participation, and communities can easily adopt these tools, fostering transparency and equity in village operations.\n\nWe are very grateful to have partnerships with a great ecosystem of infrastructure partners including:\n\n-   Inverter\n\n-   Celo\n\nWe also have implemented strategic collaborations with well technical partners such as:\n\n-   DarkMatter\\\nAnd our token system can be integrated in a typical DAO stack such as:\n\n-   Charmverse\n\n-   Snapshot\n\nAnd our projects often track ecosystem services provided through:\n\n-   Open Forest Protocol\n\n-   SimplexDNA (coming soon)\n\nWe are working with a number of distribution partners to support the growth the events and communities in our ecosystem including:\n\n-   ReFi DAO\n\n-   Regen Tribe\n\n-   Agartha\n\n-   re:build¬†\n\n-   Gathering of Tribes\n\n-   SacredOhm\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf105y3LIkosvYV3rUvk48Rkofv1GJcELfJ-nt7CbI_o_z0LyQoBh97uai2pUvz-UM-lpomVx5HqM_KU9_7yEjndH-JXE-YB-NqB-ABN3Z8XjHznKNqQIElJGVGNXh1EN4wu1aiF9gfVIH7zejaiFhm54P7?key=dxSOztJW656jhIMe5VQAsg)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOpen Source & Public Goods Innovators üìÇ\n----------------------------------------\n\nCloser contributes to Web3 public goods by providing open-source governance systems and user interfaces. The DAO framework, Proof of Presence, and Proof of Sweat systems are available for adoption by other regenerative projects, promoting decentralized governance and ecological restoration globally. This open-source approach ensures scalable regenerative practices across diverse communities.\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfOgzXpcTqR7-qL3_n0lEzoS4R40QDSp4XE1HQ1RG2Rkc6NVDGElNvEs_ffb4vgWDHpBZH4PVH0_4h0IKJjqhLn-_xNM5ZuBdkTzOUlblQyRTkI1Qo6E_C4HOAz1f-SSNs5SbD6-qkwDb4xK0dWbd3hiXhr?key=dxSOztJW656jhIMe5VQAsg)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrevious Funding & Financial Sustainability üìä\n----------------------------------------------\n\nWe have received previous funding from the following sources:\n\n-   ‚Ç¨50k from Climate Collective\n\n-   ‚Ç¨50k from Regen Network\n\n-   ‚Ç¨10k from Gitcoin donors + match funding\n\nCloser generates revenue through onboarding fees and a percentage of sales from bookings for guests, volunteers, and events. These recurring income streams are complemented by village-operated Native Tokens for internal economies. As the platform evolves, Closer will fully tokenize as a DAO, enabling decentralized funding and investment for long-term growth.\n\nWe currently have successfully onboarded four land-based communities including TDF in Portugal, Leos in Poland, Moos in Berlin and Foz in Portugal. They are all actively using the platform to manage guests and operations.\n\nScalability & Replication üìà\n----------------------------\n\nCloser's modular framework allows new villages to adopt decentralized governance incrementally, starting with non-Web3 tools and transitioning into blockchain-based governance.\n\nInfrastructure for Growth.\n\nAs successful models for decentralized land-based communities emerge through the platform, this will support the scaling of the regenerative movement.\n\nThe core infrastructure includes blockchain integration, decentralized governance systems, and a community token economy, ensuring secure, scalable management across multiple villages.\n\nSummary üîñ\n----------\n\nCloser is an open-source decentralized platform empowering regenerative villages to become socioeconomic hubs through Web2 and Web3 tools. By integrating innovative features like Native Tokens, Proof of Presence, and Proof of Sweat, Closer enables efficient resource management, transparent governance, and sustainable growth for land-based communities.\n\nOur Gitcoin fundraising aims to support the development of Proof of Presence v2.0, a crucial step in scaling the regenerative movement.

We like DAOs.. and community, and carrots. ü•ï Some people call us sheep üêë. Do sheep like carrots? Not sure, but we have some serious decentralization and governance jingle bells going on.\n\nCloser's governance model is built on DAOs, enabling decentralized decision-making through Proof of Presence and Proof of Sweat. These systems ensure that members gain governance influence based on time spent in the community and contributions made. Native Tokens incentivize participation, and communities can easily adopt these tools, fostering transparency and equity in village operations.\n\nWe are very grateful to have partnerships with a great ecosystem of infrastructure partners including:\n\n-   [Inverter](https://www.inverter.network/)\n\n-   [Celo](https://celo.org/)\n\nWe also have implemented strategic collaborations with well technical partners such as:\n\n-   [Dark Matter Labs](https://darkmatterlabs.org/)\\\nAnd our token system can be integrated in a typical DAO stack such as:\n\n-   Charmverse\n\n-   Snapshot\n\nProjects on Closer are encouraged to track ecosystem services provided through:\n\n-   Ecological Benefits Framework\n\n-   Open Forest Protocol\n\n-   SimplexDNA (coming soon)\\\nIn fact, Closer provides discounts to land based projects that implement regenerative practices as described by [OASA](https://oasa.earth/) in their [Principles of Regeneration and Land Stewardship](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ocv9rtRkDxsJmeRxrL6mV07EyWcHc2YqfN8mHoylO2E/edit), namely enforcing land is put into the commons (protected under a Land Trust or non-profit), encouraging regenerative & restorative land practices etc.\n\nWe are working with a number of distribution partners to support the growth the events and communities in our ecosystem including:\n\n-   ReFi DAO\n\n-   Regen Tribe\n\n-   Agartha\n\n-   re:build¬†\n\n-   Gathering of Tribes\n\n-   SacredOhm\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf105y3LIkosvYV3rUvk48Rkofv1GJcELfJ-nt7CbI_o_z0LyQoBh97uai2pUvz-UM-lpomVx5HqM_KU9_7yEjndH-JXE-YB-NqB-ABN3Z8XjHznKNqQIElJGVGNXh1EN4wu1aiF9gfVIH7zejaiFhm54P7?key=dxSOztJW656jhIMe5VQAsg)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOpen Source & Public Goods Innovators üìÇ\n----------------------------------------\n\nCloser contributes to Web3 public goods by providing open-source governance systems and user interfaces. The DAO framework, Proof of Presence, and Proof of Sweat systems are available for adoption by other regenerative projects, promoting decentralized governance and ecological restoration globally. This open-source approach ensures scalable regenerative practices across diverse communities.\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfOgzXpcTqR7-qL3_n0lEzoS4R40QDSp4XE1HQ1RG2Rkc6NVDGElNvEs_ffb4vgWDHpBZH4PVH0_4h0IKJjqhLn-_xNM5ZuBdkTzOUlblQyRTkI1Qo6E_C4HOAz1f-SSNs5SbD6-qkwDb4xK0dWbd3hiXhr?key=dxSOztJW656jhIMe5VQAsg)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrevious Funding & Financial Sustainability üìä\n----------------------------------------------\n\nWe have received previous funding from the following sources:\n\n-   ‚Ç¨50k from Climate Collective\n\n-   ‚Ç¨50k from Regen Network\n\n-   ‚Ç¨10k from Gitcoin donors + match funding\n\nCloser generates revenue through onboarding fees and a percentage of sales from bookings for guests, volunteers, and events. These recurring income streams are complemented by village-operated Native Tokens for internal economies. As the platform evolves, Closer will fully tokenize as a DAO, enabling decentralized funding and investment for long-term growth.\n\nWe currently have successfully onboarded four land-based communities including TDF in Portugal, Lios Labs, Moos in Berlin and Foz Da Cova in Portugal. They are all actively using the platform to manage guests and operations.\n\nScalability & Replication üìà\n----------------------------\n\nCloser's modular framework allows new villages to adopt decentralized governance incrementally, starting with non-Web3 tools and transitioning into blockchain-based governance.\n\nInfrastructure for Growth.\n\nAs successful models for decentralized land-based communities emerge through the platform, this will support the scaling of the regenerative movement.\n\nThe core infrastructure includes blockchain integration, decentralized governance systems, and a community token economy, ensuring secure, scalable management across multiple villages.\n\nSummary üîñ\n----------\n\nCloser is an open-source decentralized platform empowering regenerative villages to become socioeconomic hubs through Web2 and Web3 tools. By integrating innovative features like Native Tokens, Proof of Presence, and Proof of Sweat, Closer enables efficient resource management, transparent governance, and sustainable growth for land-based communities.\n\nOur Gitcoin fundraising aims to support the development of Proof of Presence v2.0, a crucial step in scaling the regenerative movement. With a vision to onboard 20+ villages by 2026, Closer is committed to fostering ecological restoration, community engagement, and decentralized decision-making.\n\nBy supporting Closer, you're contributing to:\n\n-   Open-source governance systems for regenerative communities\n\n-   Scalable solutions for sustainable land management\n\n-   The growth of a global network of eco-villages\n\n-   Innovative blockchain applications for real-world impact\n\nJoin us in building a more sustainable, connected future. Every contribution, no matter the size, helps us move closer to our goals.",

It is an open source decentralized platform for co-owned regenerative villages, transforming them into socioeconomic hubs through both Web2 and Web3 tools. Villages use the platform to onboard guests, volunteers, and events, while adopting blockchain-based tools like Native Tokens, Proof of Presence, and Proof of Sweat for governance and resource management. This hybrid approach empowers communities to scale sustainable practices, foster collaboration, and restore ecosystems, while transitioning seamlessly from traditional systems to decentralized governance.\n\nWe are seeking to¬† raise funds on Gitcoin via the dApps and Apps round to fund further open source software development focusing on our \"Proof Presence\" protocol v2.0 which will enable us to onboard the next generation of regenerative villages and scale the regenerative movement through place-based communities.\n\nPlease consider donating even $1, every contribution makes a difference.
