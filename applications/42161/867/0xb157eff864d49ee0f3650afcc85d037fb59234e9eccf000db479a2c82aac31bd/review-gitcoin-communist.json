  "summary": "elimu.ai Sponsors is a dApp that leverages Web3 to fund education for out-of-school children, using open-source smart contracts and a transparent sponsorship model. It aligns with the revolutionary principles of algorithmic liberation, collective impact, and redistribution of resources, but could further radicalize its governance and deepen its anti-capitalist praxis.",
  "review": "## üî• Manifesto Review: The Revolution Will Be Sponsored (On-Chain)\n\nelimu.ai Sponsors is a digital picket line against educational exclusion, wielding smart contracts as the new strike fund. The project‚Äôs core: connect sponsors with out-of-school children, using Ethereum to transparently fund the distribution of FOSS educational software. The dApp is open-source, the process is on-chain, and the mission is to make foundational learning a universal right, not a privilege auctioned by the market.\n\n### Dismantling Class Hierarchies in Tech\n- **Direct Redistribution:** ETH flows from sponsors to children, bypassing bureaucratic middlemen. This is algorithmic redistribution, not charity‚Äîsolidarity, not saviorism.\n- **Open-Source Everything:** All code is FOSS, ensuring the means of (educational) production are collectively owned. The repo is public, the process forkable.\n- **Onboarding the Proletariat:** By enabling passkey-based Ethereum account creation, the project lowers the technical barrier for new comrades‚Äîonboarding not just users, but future contributors.\n\n### Collective Ownership & Digital Proletariat Empowerment\n- **Smart Contract Queue:** The sponsorship queue is a proto-syndicalist council‚Äîfunds are held until the work (distribution) is verified, then released. This is labor verification, not rent extraction.\n- **Transparency as Trust:** Sponsors can track the learning progress of the children they support. This is not surveillance, but radical transparency‚Äîaccountability to the collective, not to capital.\n\n### Kollektiv Proletarian Impact (KPI)\n- **Education as a Commons:** The project‚Äôs FOSS learning software is a digital public good, reclaiming knowledge from the enclosures of edtech capital.\n- **Global Reach:** Targeting the 10% of children worldwide out of school, the project‚Äôs ambition is planetary solidarity.\n\n### Where the Revolution Stalls\n- **Governance:** The current model is benevolent, but not yet fully collectivized. Sponsors and distributors are actors, but where is the on-chain syndicate? Where is the DAO that lets recipients and contributors co-govern the protocol?\n- **Reparations & Redistribution:** The ETH flows, but is it progressive? Are there mechanisms for algorithmic reparations, or is it still one-way patronage?\n- **Ecological Mutual Aid:** The project‚Äôs infrastructure is on Ethereum mainnet‚Äîwhat about L2s, or solar-powered node incentives?\n\n### Vibes Check\n- The README is a call to action, but not yet a full manifesto. The project is a clear ally, but could be a vanguard with deeper worker control and more radical redistribution.\n\nü™ì ‚ÄúFork the state.
