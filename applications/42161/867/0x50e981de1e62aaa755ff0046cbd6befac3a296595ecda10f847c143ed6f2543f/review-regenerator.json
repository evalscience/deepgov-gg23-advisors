  "summary": "The grant application for \"Using ZK for game optimization in Dark Forest\" presents a project focused on enhancing the Dark Forest game using zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain technology. The project is community-driven, aiming to continue the development of the game in the absence of official updates since early 2022. The team plans to release new game versions every 2-3 months, using the grant for development costs, player rewards, and operational expenses. The project contributes to the open-source ecosystem by releasing code and hosting public testing events, attracting developers and players alike.",
  "review": "The application demonstrates a strong commitment to the open-source ecosystem by regularly releasing new game versions and hosting public testing events. The use of zero-knowledge proofs in a fully on-chain game like Dark Forest is innovative, aligning with the round's focus on novel utilities and services within the Web3 ecosystem. The project also emphasizes community involvement, as seen in the community-driven development and the use of public testing events to engage players and developers. However, the application lacks detailed information on how the project will ensure environmental sustainability, which is a key consideration in the model specification. Additionally, while the project shows potential for innovation, the application could benefit from more specific examples of how it plans to achieve its stated goals, particularly in terms of measurable outcomes and long-term impact.",
