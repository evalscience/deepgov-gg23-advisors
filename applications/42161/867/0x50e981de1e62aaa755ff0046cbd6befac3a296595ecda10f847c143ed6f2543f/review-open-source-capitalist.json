  "summary": "The grant application for \"Using ZK for game optimization in Dark Forest\" presents a project focused on enhancing a space-themed, fully on-chain MMORTS game using zero-knowledge proofs. The project aims to continue the development of Dark Forest, a community-driven version, by releasing new game versions every 2-3 months. The application highlights the project's contribution to the open-source ecosystem through open-sourcing code and hosting public testing events. The project also introduces innovative features like DF ARTEMIS and DF GAIA, which enhance gameplay and plugin development. The funding will be used for development costs, player rewards, and operational expenses.",
  "review": "The application for \"Using ZK for game optimization in Dark Forest\" demonstrates a strong commitment to the open-source ecosystem by regularly releasing new game versions and open-sourcing the code. The project leverages zero-knowledge proofs to enhance the game's mechanics, showcasing innovation in the use of blockchain technology. The introduction of features like DF ARTEMIS and DF GAIA adds value by providing new gameplay mechanics and facilitating plugin development. However, the application lacks detailed information on the project's impact on the broader Web3 ecosystem and how it aligns with the round's eligibility criteria. Additionally, the application could benefit from a clearer explanation of how the grant funds will be specifically allocated to achieve the stated goals.",
