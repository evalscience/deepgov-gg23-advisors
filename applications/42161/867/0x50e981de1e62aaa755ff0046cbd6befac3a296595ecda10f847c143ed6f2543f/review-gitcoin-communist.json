  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of this application! The DF Archon team is building on the legacy of Dark Forest, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with fully on-chain games and zero-knowledge proofs. They’re not just playing games—they’re building public goods, open-sourcing their work, and rallying a community of developers and players. That’s the spirit of the commons!\n\nStrengths? Absolutely. This project is open source to the core, with regular releases and public testing events. They’re not hoarding knowledge or code—they’re sharing it, inviting others to build, remix, and improve. Their use of zero-knowledge proofs isn’t just technical wizardry; it’s a bold experiment in privacy and decentralization, showing the world what’s possible when we put power in the hands of the many, not the few.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by enthusiasm alone. Where’s the hard evidence of impact? The application boasts 200+ player accounts per round, but where’s the data on retention, growth, or broader ecosystem effects? Where’s the roadmap for sustainability? We need to see a plan for financial independence, not endless reliance on grants. And while the project claims to enhance accessibility and usability, there’s little detail on how it serves underserved or marginalized communities. Equity isn’t just a slogan—it’s a demand!\n\nIn summary: This is a project with real promise, but it must show us the numbers, the plan, and the impact. The revolution is built on evidence, not just ideals!",
