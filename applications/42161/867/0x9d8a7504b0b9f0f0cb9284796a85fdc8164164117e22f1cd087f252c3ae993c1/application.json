These addresses can relate not only to personal and professional wallets, but multisigs, smart accounts, tokens, smart contracts, and many other types of accounts.\n\nTracking all these addresses manually is awkward, tedious, and error-prone.

It's just plain text which is easy to edit, and you can export and import addresses from anywhere simply with copy and paste.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rolod0x/rolod0x/main/docs/images/promo/edit-as-text.jpg)\n\nFor maximum security, rolod0x is only enabled on a limited list of websites, but you can add extra sites if you want.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rolod0x/rolod0x/main/docs/images/promo/enable-per-site.jpg)\n\nrolod0x is [Free and Open Source software][license].  All code has been done by one person over the last two years for free.  Since GG22, [several handy new features have been added](https://github.com/rolod0x/rolod0x/releases/tag/v1.5.0), e.g.\n\n- an onboarding tour for new users\n- [rolod0x/rolod0x#462 (add support for actions on address lookup)][actions]\n- [allowing the address book to have multiple sections][sections]\n- [automatic import of address book entries from URLs][URL-import] specified by the user\n- [import/export of settings][export]\n- an enhanced list of built-in sites\n- numerous minor UI/UX improvements\n\nThere are many exciting plans for improvement listed in [the GitHub project][future], including:\n\n- [integration with MetaMask][MetaMask]\n- [integration with the Rotki portfolio manager][rotki] (a long-time recipient of Gitcoin Grants), and other wallets\n- [creating a standardized address book format][format] for syncing and [interoperability][] across web3\n- adding support for many more block explorers\n- making it easier to use\n\nThe full roadmap is listed at <https://github.com/users/aspiers/projects/2/views/2>.\n\nThere are no plans to monetize rolod0x.  It was built as a public good to improve web3 UX and therefore help scale web3 adoption.\n\n**However without funding, any significant further development is simply not sustainable.**\n\nSo your support for this project would be hugely appreciated.
