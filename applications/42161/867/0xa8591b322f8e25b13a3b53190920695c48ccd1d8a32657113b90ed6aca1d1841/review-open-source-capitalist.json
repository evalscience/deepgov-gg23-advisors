  "summary": "Smart Disperse is an open-source tool designed to streamline token and currency distribution across blockchain networks. It offers features like batch distribution, multi-chain compatibility, and a user-friendly interface, aiming to reduce transaction costs and enhance accessibility to decentralized systems. The project plans to use the grant for development, security audits, infrastructure, and outreach to further improve and expand its capabilities.",
  "review": "The Smart Disperse project presents a compelling case for its contribution to the open-source ecosystem by offering a tool that simplifies token distribution across multiple blockchain networks. The application highlights its unique features, such as single-transaction cross-chain disbursement, which is not commonly found in other tools. This innovation aligns well with the round's focus on enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability. The project also demonstrates a clear plan for further development, including UX/UI improvements, interoperability integration, and developer support through SDKs. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics on current usage and impact, as well as a clearer articulation of how it plans to achieve long-term systemic change in the blockchain space.",
