  "summary": "Smart Disperse is an open-source tool designed to streamline token and currency distribution across blockchain networks. It offers features like batch distribution, multi-chain compatibility, and a user-friendly interface, aiming to reduce transaction costs and enhance accessibility in the blockchain ecosystem. The project plans to use grant funds for development, security audits, infrastructure, and outreach.",
  "review": "The Smart Disperse project presents a compelling case for its contribution to the open-source software ecosystem. It offers a unique solution by enabling batch distribution of tokens across multiple blockchain networks, which can significantly reduce transaction costs and improve efficiency. The project's open-source nature encourages community collaboration and innovation, aligning well with the round's eligibility criteria of enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a sustainable revenue model, which are crucial according to the model specification's principles. The project also needs to provide more information on its governance structure and how it plans to ensure equitable distribution of benefits across different communities.",
