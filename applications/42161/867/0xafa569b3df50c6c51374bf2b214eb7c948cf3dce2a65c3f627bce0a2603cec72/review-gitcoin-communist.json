The project aims to contribute to the Open Source Software (OSS) ecosystem by promoting decentralization, open-source development, and community engagement. Stogram's features include NFT integration, staking, donations, and interoperability with other platforms, all designed to empower users and creators while fostering a sustainable and innovative OSS environment.",
  "review": "Stogram presents a compelling vision for a decentralized social media platform that aligns with the goals of the GG23 OSS - dApps and Apps round. The application highlights several strengths, including its focus on user privacy, data ownership, and innovative monetization strategies for content creators. By utilizing IPFS for decentralized storage and integrating NFTs, Stogram addresses key issues in traditional social media, such as data exploitation and lack of user control. The project also emphasizes community engagement and open-source development, which are crucial for fostering a collaborative and sustainable OSS ecosystem. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on measurable outcomes and sustainability plans to align with the constitutional principles and values outlined in the model specification.",
