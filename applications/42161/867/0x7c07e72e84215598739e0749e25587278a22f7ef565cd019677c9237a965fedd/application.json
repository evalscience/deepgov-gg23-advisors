By creating a faster, more reliable alternative to current centralized archiving solutions, we're advancing the adoption of peer-to-peer protocols through a cohesive, and fairly turn-key solution. \nOur project enhances the OSS ecosystem by integrating established protocols like IPFS and Hypercore, making them more accessible for archival purposes. The uncensorable frontend payment component provides additional value by creating infrastructure that other developers can use to monetize their own open-source projects. Although still at an MVP stage, the Automator could serve as a bridge between previously disconnected elements of the DWeb ecosystem—publishing, storage, and payment systems. \nAs part of Distributed Press, our tool advances the broader mission of democratizing web publishing by automating distribution across multiple decentralized protocols, ultimately making content more resilient to censorship and linkrot by enabling collective management of code, data, and network infrastructure. This approach expands the OSS ecosystem by providing tools that allow anyone on the web to participate in content preservation and distribution.\n",

          "answer": "The Distributed Press Archive Automator addresses the challenge of information preservation in our current era where content is disappearing at an unprecedented rate, both through willful erasure and digital link rot. Many conventional archiving solutions rely on centralized infrastructure, but the Automator provides a decentralized alternative that empowers users to take control of their own digital preservation needs.\nOur primary use case focuses on websites with stable content that deserve long-term preservation for historical, personal, or professional significance. The Automator is differentiated from other solutions by enabling users to independently clone and archive their own sites without depending on institutional archival services or paying for expensive scraping solutions. Users only incur costs for ongoing storage, making preservation much more financially sustainable.\nWe've designed the Automator specifically for what we think of as ‘vulnerable information ecosystems.’ For example, small social activism or human rights organizations facing funding cuts or closure could preserve their work, despite financial constraints. Similarly, newsrooms and media outlets confronting operational challenges could maintain their archives without depending on centralized services that may also disappear. We've already demonstrated this capability through a test use case with the Harvard Public Health magazine, which announced its closure in March 2025: https://github.com/hyphacoop/distributed-press-organizing/issues/228 \n",

This user feedback will be crucial to improving the usability of Distributed Press overall. It will support planning for future improvements; for example, some of our current users have raised the need for IP privacy, so we’re considering how adding protocols such as Iroh might assist this work.\n",

        "description": "The Distributed Press Archive Automator offers a decentralized, user-friendly and relatively low-tech way to archive and store web content that should be preserved and maintained as part of our collective digital record. The Automator builds off our existing decentralized publishing stack, combining it with a payment interface loaded via an uncensorable frontend, to create a seamless, protocol-based workflow for archiving websites. \n\nAround the world, governments are restricting human rights and silencing opposition partly by purging digital information from official websites. Simultaneously, funding cuts are threatening the ability of social activists and human rights organizations to maintain their website and online resources when they close. The Archive Automator offers a practical solution by leveraging decentralized publishing and storage protocols to preserve critical information. Our low-cost payment system is designed to be financially accessible while also generating enough revenue to maintain a network of nodes for long-term storage integrity.\n\nThis work extends the proof of concept for an uncensorable frontend - a donation page - that was developed through the GC22 grant: https://k51qzi5uqu5dki3fy4lgrg46aix3ojpje20n51f4o9070u4lhpfjbtn2zvfc7q.ipns.w3s.link/ \n\nDocumentation for the work is available [here](https://docs.distributed.press/uncensorable-frontend/) \n\n![image](https://bafybeig37vy4wv54xnaqfhy7eopeslqjeozaqancbzvvhcqrm6biwdwlqq.ipfs.w3s.link/420156253-c5f10a20-0c71-4c69-b012-efa66d37a36f.png)\n\n## About Distributed Press\nThe Archive Automator builds on the existing Distributed Press stack. \n\nDistributed Press is a publishing tool designed for the distributed web, aimed at empowering publishing organizations and authors globally. With Distributed Press, you can effortlessly publish and host content across multiple distributed networks and P2P protocols, including IPFS, ActivityPub, and Hypercore. This innovative tool enhances any Content Management System (CMS) by integrating peer-to-peer (P2P) and decentralized protocols for efficient content distribution and archiving. We also offer a suite of tools for interacting with the Fediverse via ActivityPub.\n\nWhy does this matter? By combining distributed web protocols with uncensorable front ends, Distributed Press offers significant benefits:\n\n- **Self-Sovereign Content**: Maintain control over your content and ensure it remains accessible across the decentralized web.\n- **Resilience**: Reduce link rot and avoid 404 errors with robust distributed web technology.\n- **Censorship Resistance**: Bypass censorship and make your content accessible to a global audience.\n- **Broaden User Reach**: Seamlessly connect with a global network of decentralized websites, potentially increasing engagement.\n- **Overcome Connectivity Issues**: Connect with audiences in areas with limited internet access through efficient P2P discovery and localized storage solutions.\n\nMake your content more resilient with distributed web technology.\n",

      "description": "The Distributed Press Archive Automator offers a decentralized, user-friendly and relatively low-tech way to archive and store web content that should be preserved and maintained as part of our collective digital record. The Automator builds off our existing decentralized publishing stack, combining it with a payment interface loaded via an uncensorable frontend, to create a seamless, protocol-based workflow for archiving websites. \n\nAround the world, governments are restricting human rights and silencing opposition partly by purging digital information from official websites. Simultaneously, funding cuts are threatening the ability of social activists and human rights organizations to maintain their website and online resources when they close. The Archive Automator offers a practical solution by leveraging decentralized publishing and storage protocols to preserve critical information. Our low-cost payment system is designed to be financially accessible while also generating enough revenue to maintain a network of nodes for long-term storage integrity.\n\nThis work extends the proof of concept for an uncensorable frontend - [a donation page](https://k51qzi5uqu5dki3fy4lgrg46aix3ojpje20n51f4o9070u4lhpfjbtn2zvfc7q.ipns.w3s.link/) - that was developed through the GC22 grant.\n\nDocumentation for the work is available [here](https://docs.distributed.press/uncensorable-frontend/) \n\n![image](https://bafybeig37vy4wv54xnaqfhy7eopeslqjeozaqancbzvvhcqrm6biwdwlqq.ipfs.w3s.link/420156253-c5f10a20-0c71-4c69-b012-efa66d37a36f.png)\n\n## About Distributed Press\nThe Archive Automator builds on the existing Distributed Press stack. \n\nDistributed Press is a publishing tool designed for the distributed web, aimed at empowering publishing organizations and authors globally. With Distributed Press, you can effortlessly publish and host content across multiple distributed networks and P2P protocols, including IPFS, ActivityPub, and Hypercore. This innovative tool enhances any Content Management System (CMS) by integrating peer-to-peer (P2P) and decentralized protocols for efficient content distribution and archiving. We also offer a suite of tools for interacting with the Fediverse via ActivityPub.\n\nWhy does this matter? By combining distributed web protocols with uncensorable front ends, Distributed Press offers significant benefits:\n\n- **Self-Sovereign Content**: Maintain control over your content and ensure it remains accessible across the decentralized web.\n- **Resilience**: Reduce link rot and avoid 404 errors with robust distributed web technology.\n- **Censorship Resistance**: Bypass censorship and make your content accessible to a global audience.\n- **Broaden User Reach**: Seamlessly connect with a global network of decentralized websites, potentially increasing engagement.\n- **Overcome Connectivity Issues**: Connect with audiences in areas with limited internet access through efficient P2P discovery and localized storage solutions.\n\nMake your content more resilient with distributed web technology.\n",
