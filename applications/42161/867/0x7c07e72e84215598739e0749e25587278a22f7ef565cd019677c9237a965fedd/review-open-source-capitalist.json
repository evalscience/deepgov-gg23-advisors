  "review": "Alright, let’s cut through the noise and get to the code: Distributed Press - Archive Automator is gunning for the holy grail of web3—decentralized, censorship-resistant archiving. The project’s got serious hacker cred, building on IPFS and Hypercore, and it’s not just another fork of a fork. They’re targeting the root problem: link rot, censorship, and the fragility of digital memory. That’s a big, systemic pain point, and they’re swinging for the fences with a protocol-driven, open-source solution. \n\nMajor props for focusing on vulnerable info ecosystems—think activist orgs, newsrooms, and human rights defenders. That’s high-leverage impact if they can scale. The uncensorable payment front-end is a spicy touch, too—monetization infra for OSS is a meta-level win. Their MVP is still in the oven, but the roadmap is clear: onboard real users, iterate fast, and plug in privacy protocols like Iroh. \n\nBut let’s not sugarcoat it: the app’s still MVP, and there’s a whiff of vaporware until we see more live deployments and user metrics. The onboarding for non-technical users is a good move, but the UX details are thin. Also, the impact story is strong for niche communities, but the path to mass adoption and global scale needs more meat. Where’s the plan for onboarding thousands, not just a handful of nonprofits? \n\nIn short: this is a high-potential, high-risk play. If they execute, it’s a protocol-level win for the open web. But they need to show more on scalability, UX, and measurable impact. Let’s see them ship, not just ship promises.\n",
