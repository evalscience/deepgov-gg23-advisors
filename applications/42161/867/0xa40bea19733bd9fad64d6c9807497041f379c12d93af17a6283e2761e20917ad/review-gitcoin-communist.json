  "summary": "Bankless Academy is an interactive, free-to-access web3 education platform that aims to democratize blockchain knowledge and empower users to participate in the Ethereum ecosystem. The project offers multilingual educational modules, quizzes, and certifications to enhance user engagement and learning. It plans to expand its offerings by integrating AI, developing new content, and increasing its presence at Ethereum events and educational institutions globally.",
  "review": "Bankless Academy presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's focus on enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability. The project demonstrates a strong commitment to open-source principles, offering free educational resources that contribute to the growth of the OSS ecosystem. Its interactive learning modules and multilingual support are significant strengths, promoting inclusivity and accessibility. The project's plans for AI integration and content expansion indicate a forward-thinking approach, although the application could benefit from more detailed metrics on user engagement and impact. The emphasis on community-driven education and partnerships with educational institutions further supports its alignment with the round's goals. However, the application lacks specific details on the sustainability of its revenue model and how it plans to maintain operations without continuous donations. Overall, Bankless Academy is a promising project with a clear vision for expanding Web3 education, but it needs to address sustainability and provide more measurable outcomes to strengthen its application.",
