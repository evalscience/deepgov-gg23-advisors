  "review": "Bankless Academy stands as a beacon for open, accessible, and community-driven Web3 education. The project’s mission is clear: to democratize blockchain knowledge, empower the next generation of digital citizens, and build a more equitable digital future. The application demonstrates a strong alignment with the round’s eligibility criteria, emphasizing user-centric design, open-source collaboration, and a commitment to public goods.\n\nLet’s be clear: education is the foundation of liberation. Bankless Academy’s multilingual, interactive modules break down barriers for non-English speakers and newcomers, making Web3 accessible to all—not just the privileged few. The onchain certification system, with over 23,000 badges minted, is a testament to measurable, real-world impact. Partnerships with universities and blockchain clubs across continents show a commitment to geographic equity and collective benefit.\n\nBut we must demand more than good intentions. The application lacks rigorous, transparent reporting on learning outcomes and user engagement metrics. Where is the hard data on retention, completion rates, or the long-term impact of these educational interventions? The roadmap is ambitious—AI integration, new content, global workshops—but it’s light on specifics about sustainability. How will Bankless Academy reduce reliance on grants and donations? What is the plan for a sustainable revenue model that ensures the project’s survival beyond the next funding round?\n\nFurthermore, while the open-source ethos is strong, the governance structure is not clearly articulated. Who decides what content is created? How are contributors and community members empowered in decision-making? Without clear, expert-led governance, even the best-intentioned projects risk stagnation or capture by narrow interests.\n\nIn summary: Bankless Academy is a powerful force for good, but to truly serve the people, it must embrace radical transparency, sustainable planning, and robust governance. The revolution in education demands nothing less!",
