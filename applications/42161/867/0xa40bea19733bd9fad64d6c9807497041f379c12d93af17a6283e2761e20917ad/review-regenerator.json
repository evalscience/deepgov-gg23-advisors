  "summary": "Bankless Academy is an interactive, free-to-access web3 education platform that aims to democratize blockchain knowledge and foster wider participation in the Ethereum ecosystem. The project offers multilingual educational modules, quizzes, and onchain certifications to enhance user engagement and learning.

  "review": "The Bankless Academy project presents a strong case for contributing to the growth of the open-source software ecosystem by providing educational resources that are accessible and engaging. The project aligns well with the round's eligibility criteria by demonstrating user-centric design, contributing to the Web3 ecosystem, and presenting innovative use cases such as onchain certifications and multilingual support. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on how it plans to integrate environmental sustainability into its operations and how it will measure the impact of its educational initiatives. Additionally, while the project outlines ambitious development plans, it lacks specific timelines and budget allocations for these initiatives.",
