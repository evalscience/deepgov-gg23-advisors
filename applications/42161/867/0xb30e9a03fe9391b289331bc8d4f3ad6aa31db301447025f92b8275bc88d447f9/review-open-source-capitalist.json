  "summary": "VoiceDeck is an innovative platform that leverages blockchain technology to create a marketplace for impact certificates, known as hypercerts. The project aims to revolutionize funding for open-source software by focusing on outcome-based funding. It allows donors to purchase certificates representing achieved outcomes, ensuring transparency and accountability. The platform also plans to integrate prospective funding mechanisms to support ongoing causes, enhancing its utility and appeal. VoiceDeck's approach aligns with the round's goals of enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability, contributing to financial inclusion, and promoting social impact.",
  "review": "VoiceDeck presents a compelling case for funding due to its innovative approach to outcome-based funding using blockchain technology. The project aligns well with the round's objectives by enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability, contributing to financial inclusion, and promoting social impact. The integration of credit card payments broadens its reach beyond the Web3 community, which is a significant strength. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics on its impact and a clearer roadmap for future development. The focus on increasing the conversion rate of stories to impactful outcomes is promising, but the current success rate of 10% indicates room for improvement. Additionally, while the project has documented its work in peer-reviewed papers and blog posts, more concrete evidence of its impact on the OSS ecosystem would strengthen its case.",
