  "summary": "VoiceDeck is an innovative platform that focuses on outcome-based funding through the use of hypercerts, which are impact certificates that quantify and record the outcomes of projects. The platform aims to enhance the open-source software ecosystem by providing a mechanism for funding based on past achievements rather than promises. VoiceDeck has been involved in previous Gitcoin rounds and has demonstrated its potential to contribute to the growth of the OSS ecosystem by enabling organizations to record their past impacts on-chain, thus preventing the resale of outcomes. The project also integrates web2 and web3 by allowing credit card payments, broadening its accessibility. The grant funds are intended to further develop the platform by connecting retroactive funding with future impact potential, thereby increasing the conversion rate of civic problem reports into tangible solutions.",
  "review": "VoiceDeck presents a compelling case for funding with its focus on outcome-based funding through hypercerts. The project aligns well with the round's goals of enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability, as well as contributing to social impact. The integration of credit card payments is a significant step towards inclusivity, allowing users outside the web3 ecosystem to participate. The project's innovative approach to funding, which combines retroactive and prospective funding mechanisms, is noteworthy. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on how the grant funds will specifically be used to achieve the stated goals. Additionally, while the project has shown initial success, the impact of its approach on a larger scale remains to be seen. The application would be strengthened by providing more concrete examples of past successes and a clearer roadmap for future development.",
