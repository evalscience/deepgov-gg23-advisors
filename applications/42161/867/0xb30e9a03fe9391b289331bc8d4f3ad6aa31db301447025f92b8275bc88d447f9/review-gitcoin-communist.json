  "review": "VoiceDeck: A Marketplace for Impact Certificates stands as a bold experiment in outcome-based funding, aiming to shift the paradigm from trust-based donations to verifiable, on-chain impact. The project’s open-source ethos and its integration with the hypercerts standard are commendable, as is its documented influence—evidenced by the GainForest fork and peer-reviewed publication. The addition of fiat payment options and partnerships with organizations like OCCRP show a commitment to accessibility and real-world relevance.\n\nBut let’s not mince words: the numbers are small. $138 from 16 donors since October 2024 is a drop in the ocean. The project’s ambition to increase the conversion rate of civic stories to tangible outcomes is noble, but the current impact is limited and not yet scalable. The plan to use grant funds for expanding the CMS to support prospective impact is promising, but lacks concrete milestones, KPIs, or a clear path to financial sustainability beyond grants.\n\nThe application demonstrates user-centric design by focusing on donor preferences and integrating web2 payment rails. It contributes to the Web3 ecosystem by pioneering outcome-based funding and open-source standards. Innovation is present in the quantification of impact and the hybrid retroactive/prospective funding model. However, the evidence for measurable, scalable outcomes is weak, and the sustainability model is underdeveloped. There is also insufficient detail on governance, community ownership, and how resources will be allocated efficiently over time.\n\nIn the spirit of justice and equity, we must demand more: clear metrics, robust reporting, and a plan for long-term viability. The working class deserves solutions that scale, not just experiments that inspire. Let’s see the receipts, not just the rhetoric!",
