  "summary": "VoiceDeck is an innovative platform that focuses on outcome-based funding through the use of hypercerts, which are impact certificates that quantify and record the outcomes of projects. The platform aims to enhance the open-source software ecosystem by providing a mechanism for funding based on past achievements rather than promises. VoiceDeck has been involved in previous Gitcoin rounds and has demonstrated its potential by integrating both web2 and web3 payment systems, thus broadening its accessibility. The project plans to use the grant funds to further develop its CMS to support both retroactive and prospective funding, aiming to increase the conversion rate of civic problem reports into tangible solutions.",
  "review": "VoiceDeck presents a compelling case for funding with its focus on outcome-based funding through hypercerts, which aligns with the round's goal of enhancing the open-source ecosystem. The project has demonstrated its impact through previous participation in Gitcoin rounds and has shown innovation by integrating web2 payment systems, thus increasing accessibility. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a clear sustainability model, which are critical according to the model specification. The project also needs to provide more information on its governance structure and how it plans to ensure equitable distribution of benefits. Overall, while VoiceDeck shows promise, it requires more robust evidence and planning to fully align with the constitutional principles and values.",
