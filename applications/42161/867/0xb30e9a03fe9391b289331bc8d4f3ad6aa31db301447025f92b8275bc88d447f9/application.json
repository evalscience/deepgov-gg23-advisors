The GainForest team forked the VoiceDeck app to launch their own marketplace for hypercerts in the environmental domain. They even have a GG23 community round for people to quadratically fund their ecocerts!\n\n3. Broadly, outcome based funding should become a norm for funding open source software. By creating this funding mechanism, we can apply lessons learnt back to the OSS ecosystem.\n\nFor example, deepfunding.org is an initiative to fund the core ethereum dependencies with AI. It is a spin out from VoiceDeck based on smarter ways of quantifying impact of open source repos.",

VoiceDeck has a clear path to integrating organizations and communities into web3: record your past impact onchain so that it cannot be sold multiple times.\n\nReward these outcomes to support its creators to do more impactful work.\n\n3.
