Providing relevant articles, tweets, casts, and opportunities through a dedicated feed on the website.\n\nFinally, there is a major push to support builders through funding mechanisms for their contributions to open source software. We are still researching this however we imagine an ERC20 token may be appropriate, while also supporting communities by incentivizing our builders to build open source on their software in exchange for rewards like money.

We live in a world where time is incredibly valuable and giving it up is not cheap both financially and emotionally.\n\nAs we move to push work into a more decentralized and open source environment, we need to be able to properly support the framework through incentives.\n\n**Where?**\nOnline. Github. In your heart. Everywhere.\n\n**How?**\nAn entity donates crypto to the OSC's (Open Source Collective) Treasury; the treasury is owned by the OSC's multi-sig. That crypto is then allocated to the entity's designated repositories. A builder successfully merges a Pull Request on Github. OSC releases the funds to the developer through a governance proposal.\n\n**When?**\nThe time is NOW. We are calling for all builders to join the collective and get paid for their open source contributions. Companies, organizations, and businesses should reach out to OSC so that we can get visibility for your project within the collective.",

      "description": "**Who?**\nA collective of builders (software developers, engineers, artists, and beyond) who contribute to open source software.\n\n**What?**\nA mechanism to allow builders to make a sustainable living by being paid in money for contributing to open source software.\n\n**Why?**\nThere are many open source projects, however \"Time is money friend!\". We live in a world where time is incredibly valuable and giving it up is not cheap both financially and emotionally.\n\nAs we move to push work into a more decentralized and open source environment, we need to be able to properly support the framework through incentives.\n\n**Where?**\nOnline. Github. In your heart. Everywhere.\n\n**How?**\nAn entity donates crypto to the OSC's (Open Source Collective) Treasury; the treasury is owned by the OSC's multi-sig. That crypto is then allocated to the entity's designated repositories. A builder successfully merges a Pull Request on Github. OSC releases the funds to the developer through a governance proposal.\n\n**When?**\nThe time is NOW. We are calling for all builders to join the collective and get paid for their open source contributions. Companies, organizations, and businesses should reach out to OSC so that we can get visibility for your project within the collective.",
