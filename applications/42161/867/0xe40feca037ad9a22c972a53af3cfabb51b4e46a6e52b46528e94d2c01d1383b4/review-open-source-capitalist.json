  "summary": "Flicker Finance is an open-source project aimed at enhancing the crypto trading experience through a mobile application and a Rust-based library, indexes-rs, for cryptocurrency index calculation. The project seeks to democratize access to sophisticated trading tools and contribute to the open-source software ecosystem by providing accessible, collaborative, and innovative financial technology solutions.",
  "review": "Flicker Finance presents a compelling case for funding by aligning with the round's goals of enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability. The project contributes to the open-source ecosystem by developing indexes-rs, a Rust-based library that simplifies crypto index calculation, thus lowering the barrier for developers to integrate advanced financial metrics into their projects. This aligns with the constitutional principles of maximizing impact and promoting long-term systemic change by providing fundamental infrastructure improvements that can scale effectively over time. \n\nThe mobile application aspect of Flicker Finance offers real-time trading signals, trading zones, and actionable insights, which are designed to make sophisticated trading tools accessible to a broader audience. This user-centric design and functionality demonstrate a commitment to enhancing the Web3 ecosystem's growth and innovation in application use cases.\n\nHowever, the application could benefit from more detailed information on how the project plans to ensure the sustainability of its free tier and how it will measure the impact of its tools on the broader ecosystem. Additionally, while the project mentions exploring trading tools for market prediction, it lacks specific details on how these tools will be developed and integrated into the existing platform.",
