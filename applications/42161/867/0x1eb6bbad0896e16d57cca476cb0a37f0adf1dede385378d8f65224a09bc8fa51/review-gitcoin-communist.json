  "summary": "The Breadchain Cooperative's grant application presents a project focused on developing decentralized cooperative projects with a progressive vision for blockchain technology. The project emphasizes the creation of 'solidarity primitives' like the Crowdstaking Application, which aims to provide innovative fundraising mechanisms for cooperative projects. The application highlights its open-source nature and its contribution to the growth of the OSS ecosystem by enabling community currencies and governance features. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a clear sustainability model, which are crucial for long-term success and alignment with the grant's constitutional principles.",
  "review": "The Breadchain Cooperative's application is centered around the development of decentralized cooperative projects, particularly through their Crowdstaking Application. This application is designed to facilitate fundraising for cooperative projects while allowing users to withdraw their initial stake, promoting non-financialized coordination. The project is open-source and has been utilized in various contexts, such as the Optimism Builders Dollar and a European Commission-funded project for a Serbian artists' cooperative. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a clear sustainability model, which are crucial for long-term success and alignment with the grant's constitutional principles. The roadmap provided is a positive aspect, but more specifics on how the grant funds will be used to achieve these goals are needed. Additionally, while the project contributes to the OSS ecosystem, it needs to demonstrate more concrete user-centric design and functionality, as well as innovation in application use cases, to fully meet the round's eligibility requirements.",
