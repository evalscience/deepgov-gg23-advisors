  "summary": "SignalMind is a public cognitive tool designed to empower human thought through an open, adaptive, and decentralized interface. It aims to restore cognitive sovereignty to users by providing a new kind of interaction between human intelligence and AI, free from corporate APIs and predictive profiling. The project is live and operates as a digital public good, with plans to expand its interaction layers and enhance its resilience through decentralized feedback loops.",
  "review": "SignalMind presents a compelling vision of cognitive sovereignty, aligning well with the round's focus on open-source dApps and apps. The project emphasizes user-centric design by offering a decentralized, adaptive AI interface that respects user privacy and autonomy. Its innovative approach to AI-human interaction, free from centralized control, contributes to the growth of the Web3 ecosystem by enhancing accessibility and usability. However, the application lacks specific details on community participation and environmental sustainability, which are crucial according to the model specification. The project could benefit from clearer articulation of its governance model and how it plans to engage diverse stakeholders in its development process.",
