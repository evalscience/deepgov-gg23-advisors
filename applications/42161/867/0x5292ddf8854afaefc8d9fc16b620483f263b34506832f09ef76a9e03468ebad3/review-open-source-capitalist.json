  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the signal. SignalMind is pitching itself as a public cognitive tool—think open-source AI for the people, not the profit-hungry data vampires. The project claims to be live, open, and all about cognitive sovereignty. That's a bold vision, and it aligns with the round's focus on dApps/apps that push Web3 accessibility, usability, and social impact.\n\nStrengths? The project is open-source, user-centric, and aims to disrupt the centralized AI status quo. The documentation and code are public, and the ethos is all about empowering users, not extracting from them. That's max utility, baby. The vision is ambitious: decentralized, adaptive AI that evolves with user input, not corporate diktats. If it works, that's a systemic shift—exactly the kind of long-term, scalable impact we want to see.\n\nBut let's not get lost in the hype. Weaknesses? The app is currently off-chain—no smart contracts, no on-chain composability, and limited direct Web3 integration. The fact-checking and research show the project exists, but there's a lack of recent, verifiable updates and unclear user traction. The language is heavy on philosophy, light on hard metrics. Where are the user numbers, growth stats, or evidence of real-world impact? Also, the roadmap is more vibes than specifics—\"deepen the signal\" is poetic, but what does it mean in terms of deliverables?\n\nRequested changes: Show me the receipts. I want concrete metrics: active users, engagement stats, community contributions, and a clear, time-bound roadmap. If you're building the next layer of open-source cognition, prove it's more than just a cool idea. Also, clarify how you plan to integrate with the broader Web3 stack—off-chain is fine for now, but what's the path to on-chain or composable utility?\n\nBottom line: SignalMind is dripping with potential, but it's time to move from manifesto to measurable impact. Show us the numbers, tighten the roadmap, and plug into the Web3 ecosystem for max scale. Do that, and you're not just building in public—you're leading the charge.",
