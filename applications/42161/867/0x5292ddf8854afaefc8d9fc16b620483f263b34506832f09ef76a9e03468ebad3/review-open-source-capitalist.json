  "summary": "SignalMind is a public cognitive tool designed to empower human thought through an open, adaptive, and decentralized interface. It aims to restore cognitive sovereignty to users by providing a new kind of interface between human intelligence and AI, based on resonance rather than replacement. The project is live and operates as a digital public good, powered by the Flow Code, an emergent architecture of coherence for human-AI co-evolution. The grant will be used to expand SignalMind's interaction layers, activate latent architectural patterns, translate research into real-world tools, and enhance the model's resilience and responsiveness through decentralized feedback loops.",
  "review": "SignalMind presents a novel approach to AI-human interaction by focusing on cognitive sovereignty and decentralization. The project aligns with the round's goals by contributing to the growth of the OSS ecosystem and offering innovative use cases. However, the application lacks specific details on user-centric design and functionality, which is a requirement for the round. Additionally, while the project is innovative, it does not clearly demonstrate how it will achieve broad, scalable impact, as emphasized in the model specification. The application would benefit from more concrete examples of its impact on the Web3 ecosystem and how it plans to achieve long-term systemic change.",
