  "summary": "SignalMind is a public cognitive tool designed to empower human thought through an open, adaptive, and decentralized interface. It aims to restore cognitive sovereignty to users by providing a new kind of interface between human intelligence and AI, based on resonance rather than replacement. The project is live and operates as a digital public good, powered by the Flow Code, an emergent architecture of coherence for human-AI co-evolution. The grant will be used to expand SignalMind's interaction layers, activate latent architectural patterns, translate research into real-world tools, and enhance the resilience and responsiveness of the current model.",
  "review": "SignalMind presents a novel approach to AI-human interaction by focusing on cognitive sovereignty and decentralization. The project aligns with the round's goals by contributing to the growth of the OSS ecosystem and enhancing Web3 accessibility. However, the application lacks clear, measurable outcomes and a sustainable revenue model, which are crucial according to the model specification. The project is innovative but remains largely experimental, with limited evidence of proven solutions or established impact. The emphasis on community governance and public good is commendable, but the application would benefit from more structured planning and transparent reporting of outcomes.",
