Commit offers a simple yet powerful primitive, and we believe it has the potential to become a viral social app beyond ‘just’ crypto-natives. Millions of people love challenges and make commitments daily, often without realizing how central they are to life. \n\nCombining onchain accountability (credible commitments) with social and financial incentives could unlock new use cases and social behavior — from small (private friend groups / onchain communities) to large coordination mechanisms (large-scale DAOs / orgs).\n\n// latest demo: https://x.com/revrfg/status/1884426456572322231",
