            "description": "Grassroots Economics is a movement and methodology for community-led resource coordination rooted in ancestral wisdom and living ecosystems. At its heart is the understanding that economies are not just about money they are about relationships, commitments, and shared well-being. We support communities to rediscover and activate commitment pooling a protocol based on collective promises to contribute and care. Just as trees and fungi exchange nutrients in underground networks, communities can pool labor, goods, services, and trust to meet shared needs without relying on centralized systems or external funding. Drawing from traditions like Mweria in Kenya and other rotating labor associations (ROLAs) worldwide, we help revive and adapt these systems using modern tools like mobile technology and blockchain. Our work supports villages, urban neighborhoods, cooperatives, and digital communities to create commons based on four key functions: Curation (what matters), Valuation (how it’s recognized), Limitation (fair access), and Exchange (how commitments are fulfilled). Grassroots Economics is about regenerating ecosystems social, ecological, and economic through reciprocity, resilience, and radical interdependence. It’s a return to the logic of living systems, where abundance flows through trust, not transactions. Whether in a forest, a village, or a digital network, we believe every community holds the capacity to thrive when rooted in care and connected through shared commitments."
