          "description": "Due to emerging risks affecting Ethereum, core development, and its validator set, a group of teams and individuals is working on Commit-Boost, a public good initiative. Commit-Boost is an open-source Ethereum validator sidecar designed to standardize the final stage of communication between validators and proposer commitment protocols.\n\nDeveloped from scratch in Rust with contributions from over 20 teams across Ethereum, Commit-Boost is built with safety and modularity at its core. It is designed to avoid restricting downstream market participants, including stakeholders, commitment flows, enforcement mechanisms, and proposer commitments. More details can be found in our second ETH Research post: https://ethresear.ch/t/commit-boost-proposer-platform-to-safely-make-commitments/20107\n\nOur Guiding Principles\n- Would Vitalik run this? Can this initiative enhance decentralization?\n- Mission: Not-for-profit, community-driven, and fully open-source.\n- Neutrality: Agnostic to proposer commitments, preconfirmations, restaking, relays, and transaction flows.\n- Unification: A single validator-sidecar enabling participation in multiple commitment protocols.\n- Safety: Community-reviewed and audited, modularized for flexibility, and designed for greater transparency—reducing risk and operational overhead for proposers managing commitments.\n\nMilestones Achieved\n\nCommit-Boost is already deployed in production with top validators. As of writing, 7% of Ethereum blocks are being produced via Commit-Boost. All proposer commitment teams are leveraging Commit-Boost, demonstrating broad support, and over 70 contributors from across Ethereum are helping/helped in various ways.\n\nImpact\n\nBy driving standardization and unifying efforts across Ethereum, Commit-Boost helps mitigate risks to stakers and the Ethereum network while fostering an open playing field for proposer commitments. This will allow innovations such as preconfirmations for based rollups to thrive.\n\nFunding Usage\n\nNow that Commit-Boost is live in production, we are raising grant funds to support a full-time developer focused on two key areas:\n\n1) Sustainment: As adoption increases, Commit-Boost will require ongoing development, feature enhancements, and refinements based on real-world usage.\n\n2) Hardfork Support: A recurring challenge for core developers, researchers, and ETH Pandas is the lack of dedicated support for testing critical out-of-protocol infrastructure during hard forks. This burden has often fallen on them. The Commit-Boost team aims to fill this gap, ensuring smoother hard fork transitions and comprehensive testing.\n\nWe greatly appreciate the community’s support for this initiative!",

          "description": "### The Challenge We’re Tackling\nAcross Kenya and around the world, communities possess rich traditions of mutual aid, ecological knowledge, and collective care. Yet these ways of living and giving are often invisible to the formal economy. When markets fail or extract value, people are left unable to coordinate the abundance already within reach: fertile land, skilled hands, cultural knowledge, and strong relationships. What if we could bring visibility and value to these hidden commons—reviving ancestral systems of cooperation to build resilient, regenerative local economies?\n\n### Our Solution\nGrassroots Economics supports communities to organize themselves through Commitment Pooling—a protocol inspired by both ecological systems and indigenous traditions like Mweria (rotating labor groups). Through Commitment Pooling, communities define what is valuable, coordinate labor and care, and exchange commitments using tools like the Sarafu Network, our blockchain-based voucher system.\nWhether it’s in rural villages like Kiriba, peri-urban settlements, or refugee camps, communities use this protocol to regenerate ecosystems, build shared infrastructure, and care for one another—without needing formal currency. The result is a living, trust-based economy rooted in shared responsibility, long-term reciprocity, and ecological balance.\n\n### Our Organisation / Community\nCommitment Pooling is a community-led protocol developed by Grassroots Economics that enables people to coordinate resources, labor, and care without relying on money. Inspired by ancestral traditions like Mweria (rotating labor associations in Kenya) and ecological systems such as fungal networks, Commitment Pooling helps communities build collective trust and mutual service systems through shared commitments.\n\nAt its heart, Commitment Pooling is based on four core functions: Curation, Valuation, Limitation, and Exchange. Communities first curate what actions or services are valuable—such as planting trees, repairing homes, or caring for elders. They then value these contributions, ensuring all forms of labor and care are recognized. Through limitation, they agree on fair access and avoid overuse of shared resources. Finally, they exchange commitments using community agreements or digital tools like the Sarafu Network, a blockchain-based system that tracks and honors these commitments transparently.\n\nThis protocol transforms how communities organize collective action. Instead of waiting for outside funding or relying on scarce cash, people pool their promises and labor into a shared commons. These commitments become a kind of social currency, used to regenerate ecosystems, strengthen social bonds, and meet local needs.\n\nGrassroots Economics implements Commitment Pooling across Kenya, helping communities like those in Kiriba, Kilifi, revive traditional knowledge and co-create resilient, regenerative economies. Each act of service becomes part of a living economy rooted in trust and reciprocity—showing that care, not cash, is the foundation of sustainable development. Commitment Pooling is more than a system—it’s a return to the logic of life.\n\n\n### 🖼️ See Our Impact\n![alt text](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/_next/image?url=%2Fapi%2Fhypercert-image%2F42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-64313367348057369594577800804604191965184&w=640&q=75)\n\n\n### View Our Hypercert [here](https://www.ecocertain.xyz/hypercert/42220-0x16bA53B74c234C870c61EFC04cD418B8f2865959-64313367348057369594577800804604191965184)\n\n### What This Hypercert Represents:\nThis hypercert documents the on-the-ground revival of rotating labor associations, mutual service exchanges, and ecological restoration across several Kenyan communities. It highlights the power of Sarafu vouchers and Commitment Pooling Protocols to coordinate thousands of hours of labor—planting food forests, restoring water catchments, rebuilding homes, and strengthening social cohesion—all without money changing hands.\n\n### Proof That It’s Working\nFrom Kiriba to Mathare, communities using commitment pooling show real outcomes: improved food security, increased trust, and reduced dependence on volatile cash markets. Families are meeting weekly to regenerate their land and care for each other. Local schools, seed banks, and sacred groves are being protected and revived. All activities are tracked transparently via Sarafu, showcasing both social and ecological impact.\n\n### Join Us in Making a Difference!\nYour contribution supports a global shift—from scarcity to sufficiency, from extraction to care. Every seed you plant through this project helps a community revive its commons: rebuilding homes, restoring ecosystems, and strengthening the fabric of mutual support.\nThis isn’t charity—it’s co-creation. Together, we are building decentralized, resilient economies grounded in ancestral wisdom, ecological stewardship, and modern tools of coordination.\nAct now. Another village is ready to rise. Let’s grow this network of care together.\n\n\n\n",

Those who achieve their goals get their stake back, plus a share of the losers' stakes and any additional 'extra rewards' (erc20 tokens; soon more).\n\nWe believe we need more meaningful apps solving real problems — not just speculation-driven ones. Commit offers a simple yet powerful primitive, and we believe it has the potential to become a viral social app beyond ‘just’ crypto-natives. Millions of people love challenges and make commitments daily, often without realizing how central they are to life. \n\nCombining onchain accountability (credible commitments) with social and financial incentives could unlock new use cases and social behavior — from small (private friend groups / onchain communities) to large coordination mechanisms (large-scale DAOs / orgs).\n\n// latest demo: https://x.com/revrfg/status/1884426456572322231"

Further, today’s block construction process is highly centralized, Commit-Boost returns autonomy to Ethereum’s +1m proposers to put constraints around how builders must construct a block. By providing a single, standardized solution and the ability to constrain builders, Commit-Boost enhances **network security, reduces fragmentation, and streamlines operations for validators.**\n\nKey Metrics & Impact:\n-\tAdoption: All preconfirmation teams (five different teams) are building on Commit-Boost.\n-\tNetwork Usage: Currently, ~7% of Ethereum blocks are being built through Commit-Boost, and this number is expected to grow.\n-\tEcosystem Collaboration: Development has been supported by over 20 teams across Ethereum.\n\nWhile Commit-Boost was not yet in a position to contribute to Pectra, we plan to assist with Fuska by helping update the PBS pipeline for the next hard fork and ensuring thorough testing."

Based rollups facilitate seamless interoperability between Ethereum and other based rollups, improving transaction efficiency and reducing latency.\n\nRecognizing the potential of preconfs to enhance interoperability, multiple researchers at the Ethereum Foundation (EF) have spent the past few years advocating for this solution. Today, over 20 teams are actively working to turn this research into reality, leveraging Commit-Boost as a key component in its implementation."

              "explanation": "Commit-Boost tackles several critical challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem, improving security, user experience, decentralization, and core development efficiency. Here’s how:\n-\t**Security & Efficiency:** Without Commit-Boost, validators would likely need to run multiple sidecars, increasing complexity and risks. Commit-Boost provides a unified sidecar, reducing operational overhead and enhancing security.\n-\t**Improved User Experience:** Currently, no existing sidecar supports proposer commitments, such as preconfirmations (preconfs), which are essential for based rollups and a seamless user experience. All preconf teams are building on Commit-Boost to enable this functionality.\n-\t**Open & Inclusive Design:** Commit-Boost fosters an open playing field, allowing anyone to build on it and any staker—including solo stakers—to run it. It also minimizes switching costs for proposers, preventing vendor lock-in from downstream participants.\n-\t**Enhancing Decentralization:** Today’s block construction is highly centralized. Commit-Boost enables proposers to set conditions and constraints on how their blocks are built, shifting power back to Ethereum’s 1M+ validator set.\n-\t**Supporting Ethereum Core Development:** During hard forks, core developers are currently burdened with making changes to the PBS (Proposer-Builder Separation) pipeline, diverting their focus from more critical tasks. Moving forward, Commit-Boost will take on these updates, ensuring smoother hard forks and freeing up core devs for higher-priority improvements."

These grant funds will be used alongside grants from across Ethereum:\n-\tIntegration of Commit-Boost with DVT solutions such as Obol and SSV\n-\tBuild out a data base to support dashboards / transparency\n-\tAdd more features such as slashing protection that has been requested by proposers / the Commit-Boost community (more details in our repo: https://github.com/Commit-Boost/commit-boost-client/issues)"

              "explanation": "**Decentralization**\nCommit-Boost enhances decentralization by:\n-\tEmpowering Ethereum’s 1M+ proposers to set constraints on downstream actors in the PBS (Proposer-Builder Separation) pipeline, such as builders, giving them greater autonomy.\n-\tEnsuring accessibility for all proposers, including solo stakers and DVT (Distributed Validator Technology) users, keeping Ethereum’s proposer set decentralized.\n-\tMaintaining an open standard that anyone can build on, preventing vendor lock-in. By fostering greater competition and diversity among builders and other network participants, Commit-Boost strengthens Ethereum’s decentralization.\n\n**Security**\nCommit-Boost improves security by:\n-\tProviding a unified sidecar, which:\n-\t1) Reduces risks during hard forks by consolidating multiple competing standards into a single, well-integrated standard that directly interacts with client software.\n-\t2) Minimizes attack vectors for stakers by reducing the number of sidecars they need to run.\n-\tEnhancing hard fork preparedness by enabling earlier testing of the PBS pipeline, identifying potential issues and risks before deployment. This not only improves the stability of hard forks but also reduces the workload for core developers, allowing them to focus on more critical tasks.\n-\tBeing the only officially audited validator sidecar, with development contributions from proposers and 20+ teams across Ethereum. Commit-Boost has also undergone extensive testing on Holesky, ensuring reliability before deployment."
