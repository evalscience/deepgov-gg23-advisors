This approach will allow DeVouch to sustain itself while maintaining its role as a public good. The contract also optimizes reputation-building by bundling attestations efficiently and making the costs lower for users.  \nDeVouch supports web3 adoption and open collaboration by strengthening decentralized trust and reducing Sybil risks in grant funding.

This contract introduces a micro-fee of $0.10 per vouch or flag, allowing DeVouch to generate revenue while maintaining its mission as a public good. It will also improve usability by bundling multiple attestations efficiently, reducing transaction costs, and making decentralized reputation-building more accessible.\nThe grant funds will be used to finalize development, conduct testing, and deploy the resolver contract on Optimism Mainnet. This includes expanding test scenarios, performing QA testing, and integrating the contract seamlessly into DeVouch’s existing infrastructure. The funding will also support backend optimizations.\nBeyond the resolver contract, DeVouch plans to expand its reputation system by integrating with additional funding ecosystems and governance frameworks. Future developments will focus on improving attestation aggregation, enhancing Sybil resistance mechanisms, and making DeVouch a plug-and-play solution for Web3 projects that require decentralized trust verification.\n",

        "description": "## About\n[DeVouch](https://devouch.xyz/) streamlines reputation infrastructure by leveraging EAS and existing reputation networks (e.g., delegates, badgeholders, passport, etc.), making it easy to establish and verify project reputations in the Web3 ecosystem. Our goal is to provide simple, ready-made, and interoperable infrastructure for communities that need to assess the credibility of projects receiving funding. While our front end serves as a reference implementation, the backend infrastructure is designed to be extensible and seamlessly integrated into other front-end applications.\nDeVouch enables members of trusted organizations within the Ethereum ecosystem to vouch for projects seeking funding.  By endorsing a project, these organizations lend their credibility, building trust among potential supporters and funders.\n### How DeVouch Works\nDeVouch collects and displays grant-funded projects from multiple platforms, enabling users to:\n* Vouch for a project by minting an on-chain attestation signaling trust and credibility.\n* Flag a project to warn against potential risks.\n* Aggregate and assess reputations using decentralized attestations from trusted Web3 ecosystem members.\n* Enhance funding confidence by providing an additional trust layer for grants, ensuring that reputable projects receive recognition.\n### Who Uses DeVouch\n* **Funders & Grant Programs** – Investors, grant allocators, and funding bodies use DeVouch to evaluate project legitimacy and reputation.\n* **Builders & Project Teams** – Grant applicants use DeVouch to establish and strengthen their credibility in Web3.\n* **Communities & Contributors** – Individuals participating in Web3 funding initiatives can monitor and engage with project reputations.\nDeVouch serves as a library of Web3 projects where people can view and learn about projects, leveraging attestations from reputable individuals.\n## DeVouch Custom Resolver Contract\nTo ensure long-term sustainability and enhance its on-chain reputation-building capabilities, DeVouch is developing the DeVouch Custom Resolver Contract. This smart contract introduces a 0.00006 ETH fee per vouch or flag, enabling DeVouch to sustain itself while maintaining its role as a public good.\n### Key Benefits of the Custom Resolver Contract:\n* **Financial Sustainability** – Generates revenue to support DeVouch’s infrastructure and growth.\n* **Optimized On-Chain Reputation System** – Bundles multiple attestations efficiently, improving usability.\n* **Decentralized Verification** – Strengthens community-driven reputation networks for grant-funded projects.\n### Planned Milestones:\n* **Finalize Development & Testing** – Expanding test scenarios for reliability and security.\n* **Optimism Mainnet Deployment & QA** – Deploying the resolver contract on Optimism and conducting comprehensive quality assurance testing.\n* **Integration into DeVouch Infrastructure** – Ensuring seamless functionality within the existing DeVouch system.\n##Learn More\nTo explore DeVouch, its impact, and upcoming developments:\nVisit [DeVouch’s Website](https://devouch.xyz/)\nFollow updates on [X](https://x.com/Devouchxyz)\n",

      "description": "## About\n[DeVouch](https://devouch.xyz/) streamlines reputation infrastructure by leveraging EAS and existing reputation networks (e.g., delegates, badgeholders, passport, etc.), making it easy to establish and verify project reputations in the Web3 ecosystem. Our goal is to provide simple, ready-made, and interoperable infrastructure for communities that need to assess the credibility of projects receiving funding. While our front end serves as a reference implementation, the backend infrastructure is designed to be extensible and seamlessly integrated into other front-end applications.\nDeVouch enables members of trusted organizations within the Ethereum ecosystem to vouch for projects seeking funding.  By endorsing a project, these organizations lend their credibility, building trust among potential supporters and funders.\n### How DeVouch Works\nDeVouch collects and displays grant-funded projects from multiple platforms, enabling users to:\n* Vouch for a project by minting an on-chain attestation signaling trust and credibility.\n* Flag a project to warn against potential risks.\n* Aggregate and assess reputations using decentralized attestations from trusted Web3 ecosystem members.\n* Enhance funding confidence by providing an additional trust layer for grants, ensuring that reputable projects receive recognition.\n### Who Uses DeVouch\n* **Funders & Grant Programs** – Investors, grant allocators, and funding bodies use DeVouch to evaluate project legitimacy and reputation.\n* **Builders & Project Teams** – Grant applicants use DeVouch to establish and strengthen their credibility in Web3.\n* **Communities & Contributors** – Individuals participating in Web3 funding initiatives can monitor and engage with project reputations.\nDeVouch serves as a library of Web3 projects where people can view and learn about projects, leveraging attestations from reputable individuals.\n## DeVouch Custom Resolver Contract\nTo ensure long-term sustainability and enhance its on-chain reputation-building capabilities, DeVouch is developing the DeVouch Custom Resolver Contract. This smart contract introduces a 0.00006 ETH fee per vouch or flag, enabling DeVouch to sustain itself while maintaining its role as a public good.\n### Key Benefits of the Custom Resolver Contract:\n* **Financial Sustainability** – Generates revenue to support DeVouch’s infrastructure and growth.\n* **Optimized On-Chain Reputation System** – Bundles multiple attestations efficiently, improving usability.\n* **Decentralized Verification** – Strengthens community-driven reputation networks for grant-funded projects.\n### Planned Milestones:\n* **Finalize Development & Testing** – Expanding test scenarios for reliability and security.\n* **Optimism Mainnet Deployment & QA** – Deploying the resolver contract on Optimism and conducting comprehensive quality assurance testing.\n* **Integration into DeVouch Infrastructure** – Ensuring seamless functionality within the existing DeVouch system.\n##Learn More\nTo explore DeVouch, its impact, and upcoming developments:\nVisit [DeVouch’s Website](https://devouch.xyz/)\nFollow updates on [X](https://x.com/Devouchxyz)\n",
