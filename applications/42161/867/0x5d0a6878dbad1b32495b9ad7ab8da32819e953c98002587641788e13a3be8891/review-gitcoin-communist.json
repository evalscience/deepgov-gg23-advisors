  "summary": "DeVouch is a decentralized reputation system for Web3 grant funding, aggregating projects from platforms like Gitcoin, Giveth, and Optimism Retro Funding. It aims to enhance project credibility through verifiable, on-chain attestations. The project plans to introduce a Custom Resolver Contract to ensure financial sustainability by charging a small fee per vouch or flag. This contract will also optimize reputation-building by bundling attestations efficiently. DeVouch supports web3 adoption by reducing Sybil risks and has been used by several communities. The grant will be used to finalize development, conduct testing, and deploy the resolver contract on the Optimism Mainnet.",
  "review": "The DeVouch project presents a compelling case for enhancing the Web3 ecosystem through a decentralized reputation system. It aligns well with the round's focus on open-source dApps and apps that contribute to Web3 accessibility and usability. The project demonstrates a user-centric design by allowing funders, builders, and communities to assess project credibility through on-chain attestations. It contributes to the Web3 ecosystem by reducing Sybil risks and enhancing decentralized trust, which is crucial for the growth of open-source projects. The introduction of a Custom Resolver Contract for financial sustainability is a strong point, as it aligns with the sustainability principles outlined in the model specification. However, the application could benefit from more detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a clearer demonstration of innovation in application use cases. Additionally, while the project mentions its use by several communities, more specific examples or data on its impact would strengthen the application.",
