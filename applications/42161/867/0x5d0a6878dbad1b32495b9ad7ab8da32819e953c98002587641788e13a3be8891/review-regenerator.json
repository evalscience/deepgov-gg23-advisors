  "summary": "DeVouch is a decentralized reputation system designed to enhance the credibility of Web3 grant funding by aggregating projects from platforms like Gitcoin, Giveth, and Optimism Retro Funding. It introduces a Custom Resolver Contract to ensure financial sustainability through a micro-fee model, while maintaining its role as a public good. The project aims to strengthen decentralized trust, reduce Sybil risks, and support Web3 adoption by providing a community-driven reputation layer. The grant funds will be used to finalize the development and deployment of the resolver contract, expand test scenarios, and integrate the contract into DeVouchâ€™s infrastructure.",
  "review": "The DeVouch project presents a compelling case for enhancing the Web3 ecosystem by providing a decentralized reputation system that aggregates data from multiple funding platforms. This approach aligns well with the round's focus on accelerating the adoption and development of open-source dApps and apps. The introduction of the DeVouch Custom Resolver Contract is a notable innovation, offering a sustainable funding model through micro-fees, which supports the project's long-term viability as a public good. The project's emphasis on decentralized trust and reducing Sybil risks is commendable, as it addresses key challenges in the Web3 funding landscape. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on how the project will ensure user-centric design and functionality, as well as specific examples of innovation in application use cases. Additionally, while the project mentions plans for further development, a clearer timeline and milestones would strengthen the application.",
