  "summary": "DeVouch is a decentralized reputation system for Web3 grant funding, aiming to enhance the credibility of projects through on-chain attestations. It aggregates data from platforms like Gitcoin, Giveth, and Optimism Retro Funding, allowing users to vouch for or flag projects. The project plans to implement a Custom Resolver Contract to introduce a micro-fee for sustainability and improve usability. The grant will support the development and deployment of this contract, as well as future integrations with additional ecosystems.",
  "review": "The DeVouch project presents a compelling case for enhancing the Web3 ecosystem by providing a decentralized reputation system that aggregates data from multiple platforms. This approach aligns well with the round's focus on accelerating the adoption and development of open-source dApps and apps. The project's emphasis on decentralized trust and reducing Sybil risks is innovative and addresses a significant challenge in the Web3 funding space. The introduction of a Custom Resolver Contract to ensure financial sustainability and improve usability is a strategic move that could enhance the project's long-term viability. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the project's current impact metrics and user adoption rates to better assess its scalability and effectiveness. Additionally, while the project outlines plans for future development, a more detailed roadmap with specific milestones and timelines would strengthen the application.",
