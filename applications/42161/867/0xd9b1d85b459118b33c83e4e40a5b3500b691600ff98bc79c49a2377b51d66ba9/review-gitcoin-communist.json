  "summary": "Kapan Finance is a project aimed at optimizing debt management across DeFi lending protocols using flash loans. It seeks to address inefficiencies in interest rates and democratize access to flash loan arbitrage, traditionally reserved for large institutions. The project is currently in alpha testing on Arbitrum and plans to expand to other networks. The grant will be used for smart contract audits, expanding protocol support, and launching incentive programs.",
  "review": "Kapan Finance presents a compelling solution to a significant problem in the DeFi space: the inefficiency and costliness of managing debt across multiple lending protocols. By leveraging flash loans, the project aims to democratize access to debt optimization, a feature typically reserved for large institutions. The application clearly outlines its current status, future plans, and how the grant will be utilized, aligning well with the round's focus on open-source dApps that enhance Web3 accessibility and usability. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a sustainable revenue model, which are critical according to the model specification. The project's reliance on continuous onboarding of protocols and chains may pose sustainability challenges. Additionally, while the project is open-source, the specifics of community governance and geographic equity are not well addressed.",
