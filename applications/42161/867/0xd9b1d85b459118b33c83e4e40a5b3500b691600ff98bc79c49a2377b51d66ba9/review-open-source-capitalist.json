  "summary": "Kapan Finance is a DeFi project focused on optimizing debt positions across lending protocols using flash loans. It aims to reduce borrowing costs and democratize MEV for retail users by automating cross-protocol debt optimization. The project is currently in alpha testing on Arbitrum and plans to expand to other networks. The grant funds will be used for smart contract audits, protocol incentives, and multi-chain expansion.",
  "review": "Kapan Finance presents a compelling solution to a common problem in the DeFi space: the inefficiency and costliness of managing debt across multiple protocols. By leveraging flash loans, the project enables users to migrate debt positions seamlessly, potentially reducing borrowing costs by up to 60%. This aligns well with the round's focus on enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability. The project demonstrates innovation through its atomic debt migration feature and its commitment to open-source principles by planning to open-source its core contracts post-audit. However, the application lacks detailed information on user-centric design and specific metrics for measuring impact, which are crucial for evaluating its potential contribution to the Web3 ecosystem. Additionally, the timeline for the smart contract audit (Q3 2025) seems distant, which could delay the project's full deployment and impact.",
