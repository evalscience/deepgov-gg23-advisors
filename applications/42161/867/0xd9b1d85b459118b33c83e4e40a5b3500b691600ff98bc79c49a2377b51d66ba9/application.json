          "answer": "Further development right now is focused around finishing the core set of features and onboarding more protocols. While some of them have scattered functionality around collateral swaps and debt swaps (one debt asset to another), I plan to have all of this cohesively implemented within Kapan. \n\nAfter finishing the \"single\" network only features, funds will be used to audit the contracts and have an official release. \n\nAfter which funds will be used to build capacity for deploying incentives to migrate debt and supply, which should enable lending protocols to further amplify the attractiveness of their protocols while benefiting users.\n\nWhile gaining the initial traction, we plan on implementing support for EIP-7702 and EIP-4337 wallets. Users going through them would have a better UX and early access to some features (due to them being  easier and quicker to implement for those wallets, securely) \n\nOnce the protocol has gained some traction, we will begin work on the cross chain features with the main goal of enabling debt to be moved across chains to maximize potential APR savings. \n\nThe final planned step is to have  automated management over debt, where it is moved across protocols and chains. With more chains and protocols being onboarded, interest rates would drop and token types one could borrow and supply would grow.\n\nOverall with so many protocols and chains existing, there would always be a need for the tools to optimize across them and abstract their complexity from end users who are looking for the best deal.",
