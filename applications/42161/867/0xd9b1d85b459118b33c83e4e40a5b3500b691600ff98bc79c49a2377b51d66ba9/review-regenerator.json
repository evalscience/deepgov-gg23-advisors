  "review": "Kapan Finance presents a compelling solution to a significant problem in the DeFi space: the inefficiency and costliness of managing debt across multiple protocols. By leveraging flash loans, the project aims to enable users to migrate debt positions seamlessly, thus optimizing interest rates and reducing costs. The application demonstrates a clear understanding of the DeFi landscape and proposes innovative solutions to enhance user experience and financial efficiency. The project's focus on non-custodial, permissionless operations aligns with the open-source and decentralized ethos of the Web3 ecosystem. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on community engagement strategies and environmental sustainability considerations. Additionally, while the project is innovative, the timeline for certain developments, such as smart contract audits, seems extended, which could delay potential benefits to users.",
