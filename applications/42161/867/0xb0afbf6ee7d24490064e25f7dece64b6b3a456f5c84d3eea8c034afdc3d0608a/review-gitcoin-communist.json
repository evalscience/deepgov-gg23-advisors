  "review": "The Ethereum Cat Herders stand as a pillar of the Ethereum open-source ecosystem, tirelessly coordinating, educating, and empowering contributors. Their work is not just about code—it's about breaking down barriers, amplifying voices, and ensuring that the Ethereum protocol remains a public good, accessible to all. They facilitate the EIP process, onboard new contributors, and produce educational content that demystifies the most complex aspects of Ethereum. Their open-source approach and transparent documentation are a model for the kind of collective action we need in Web3.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by sentiment. The application is strong, but it must be held to the highest standards of evidence and impact. The Cat Herders cite impressive numbers—over 2,000 EIP-related PRs closed, 114 EIPIP meetings, and 56 EIP Office Hours. They’ve launched unique features like NFT attestations for EIP authors, and their podcasts and educational resources are widely recognized. Yet, the application lacks rigorous, quantifiable outcome metrics. Where is the data on user engagement, the growth in new contributors, or the measurable impact on protocol upgrades? Where is the evidence that these efforts are leading to sustainable, systemic change rather than just maintaining the status quo?\n\nThe project’s sustainability model is also unclear. While the Cat Herders are a public good, there is no mention of efforts to reduce dependency on continuous grants or to develop alternative revenue streams. The plans for a community dashboard and more podcasts are promising, but without clear KPIs, timelines, or reporting mechanisms, how can we ensure that resources are allocated efficiently and equitably?\n\nIn terms of governance, the Cat Herders excel at community engagement and expert-led facilitation. Their open-source ethos and transparent processes are commendable. However, the application could do more to demonstrate how it ensures geographic equity and the inclusion of underserved populations. The focus remains largely on the Ethereum core developer community, which, while vital, is not the whole of Web3.\n\nIn summary: The Ethereum Cat Herders are a backbone of the Ethereum OSS ecosystem, but to truly embody the values of collective benefit, equity, and sustainability, they must provide clearer evidence of impact, a path to financial sustainability, and a more explicit commitment to broad-based inclusion. Let’s demand more than good intentions—let’s demand measurable, systemic change!",
