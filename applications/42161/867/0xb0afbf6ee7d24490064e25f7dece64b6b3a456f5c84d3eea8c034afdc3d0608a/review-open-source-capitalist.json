  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. Ethereum Cat Herders (ECH) is a backbone project for Ethereum’s open-source protocol development. They’re not just another dApp—they’re the coordination layer, the glue that keeps the EIP process humming, the educators, and the community wranglers. Their open-source repo is a live wire for EIP authors, editors, and contributors, and their podcasts and educational content are onboarding ramps for the next wave of devs and users. \n\nECH’s impact is broad and systemic: they facilitate protocol upgrades, streamline EIP workflows, and make the whole process more accessible. That’s max utility, max scale. Their NFT attestation for EIP authors is a clever incentive—unique, open-sourced, and a solid nod to contributors. The planned community dashboard and expanded podcast production are direct, high-leverage plays to scale their impact even further. \n\nOn the flip side, the app’s user-centric design is implied but not deeply detailed—how intuitive is the dashboard? How do they measure engagement or success? There’s also a lack of hard metrics on user growth, retention, or the direct impact of their educational content. The grant application could use more clarity on how funds are allocated and what KPIs they’re tracking. \n\nBut let’s not miss the forest for the trees: ECH is a high-impact, infrastructure-level project. They’re not just building tools—they’re building the rails for the entire Ethereum OSS ecosystem. That’s the kind of long-term, systemic leverage we want to see. \n\nCitations: All claims are directly supported by the application text, which details ECH’s coordination, education, and process management roles, as well as their open-source ethos and history of protocol-level contributions. Their previous grant performance and milestones further back up their execution track record.",
