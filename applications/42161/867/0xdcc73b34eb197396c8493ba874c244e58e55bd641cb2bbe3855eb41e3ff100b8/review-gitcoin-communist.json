  "review": "Let’s get straight to the heart of the matter: The Dharma Code is a bold, ambitious project that seeks to put the power of storytelling, culture, and economic opportunity back into the hands of the people—especially those too often left out of the digital revolution. This is the kind of vision that can shake the foundations of the old order. But vision alone is not enough. We must demand evidence, structure, and a clear path to measurable, collective benefit.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The project is open source at its core, with a public GitHub and a commitment to releasing smart contracts, governance frameworks, and educational materials under open licenses. This is the bedrock of any true public good.\n- Dharma Code’s focus on underrepresented regions and languages—specifically Bhutan and Dzongkha—directly addresses the historic exclusion of non-Western voices from both tech and culture. This is equity in action.\n- The platform’s design is user-centric, with a clear emphasis on accessibility for non-technical users, multi-language support, and educational onboarding. This is not just tech for tech’s sake; it’s tech for the people.\n- The project’s environmental component—tying creative participation to reforestation and climate action—demonstrates a rare commitment to planetary sustainability alongside social impact.\n- The plan to make the platform forkable and replicable, with an open SDK, shows a commitment to the commons and the long-term growth of the ecosystem.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The application is heavy on vision and narrative, but light on hard, quantifiable outcomes. Where are the metrics? How many users will be onboarded? How many films funded? How much revenue shared? We need numbers, not just stories.\n- There is insufficient detail on the governance model. How will the DAO be structured? What safeguards exist to prevent capture by a small elite? Community governance must be more than a slogan.\n- The sustainability model is promising, but vague. How will ongoing platform costs be covered once grant funds run out? What is the projected revenue from NFTs, ticket sales, or other sources? Show us the math.\n- The educational impact is asserted, but not measured. How will you track the number of learners, the effectiveness of your curriculum, or the real-world outcomes for participants?\n- No deployer addresses or smart contract audits are provided. For a project promising financial inclusion and transparency, this is a glaring omission.\n\n**Requested Changes:**\n1. **Define Clear, Measurable Outcomes:**\n   - Set specific targets for user onboarding, films funded, revenue distributed, and educational participation. Commit to transparent reporting.\n2. **Detail the Governance Structure:**\n   - Provide a concrete DAO framework, including voting mechanisms, anti-capture measures, and community participation processes.\n3. **Clarify the Sustainability Model:**\n   - Present a financial plan showing how the platform will sustain itself post-grant, with revenue projections and cost breakdowns.\n4. **Establish Educational Metrics:**\n   - Define how you will measure the reach and impact of your educational initiatives, including tracking and reporting mechanisms.\n5. **Provide Technical Transparency:**\n   - List all deployer addresses, publish smart contract audits, and ensure all code is accessible and documented for public review.\n\n**Final Word:**\nDharma Code is a rallying cry for cultural and economic justice in Web3. But the revolution demands more than good intentions—it demands accountability, transparency, and measurable results. Show us the numbers. Show us the structure. Prove that this is not just another dream, but a movement that delivers real, lasting change for the many, not the few.\n\nSolidarity forever!",
