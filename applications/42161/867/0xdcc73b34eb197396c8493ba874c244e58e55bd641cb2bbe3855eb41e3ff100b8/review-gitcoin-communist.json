  "summary": "The Dharma Code is a Web3-powered cultural and filmmaking platform that aims to expand the open source ecosystem by introducing blockchain-native tools, education, and infrastructure to the creative industries, particularly in underrepresented regions like Bhutan. The project focuses on decentralized film financing, governance, and community engagement, offering open-source tools, educational content, and a focus on language accessibility. It aims to bridge OSS with real-world cultural, economic, and educational needs, contributing to the ecosystem by developing blockchain-native OSS tools, creating localized educational resources, and applying OSS to cultural and economic challenges.",
  "review": "The Dharma Code project presents a compelling vision for integrating blockchain technology into the creative industries, particularly in underrepresented regions like Bhutan. The project aligns well with the round's eligibility criteria by demonstrating user-centric design, contributing to Web3 ecosystem growth, and presenting innovative application use cases. The focus on decentralized film financing, governance, and community engagement through open-source tools and educational content is commendable. The project also emphasizes language accessibility and cultural inclusion, which are crucial for expanding OSS access to non-English-speaking communities. However, the application lacks detailed information on measurable outcomes and quantifiable results, which are essential for evaluating the project's impact. Additionally, while the project outlines a sustainable revenue model, it does not provide sufficient evidence of its long-term viability. The governance structure, although community-driven, could benefit from more clarity on expert-led decision-making processes. Overall, the project shows promise but requires more concrete evidence and detailed planning to ensure its success and sustainability.",
