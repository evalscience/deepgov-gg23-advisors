  "review": "Alright, let’s cut through the noise and get straight to the code: The Dharma Code is a Web3-powered, open-source dApp aiming to decentralize film financing, governance, and education—starting with Bhutan, but with ambitions to scale globally. The project’s got a strong narrative: tokenized film ownership, NFT-based access, DAO-driven creative decisions, and a big push for onboarding non-technical, non-Western users into the Web3 fold. There’s a climate-positive angle too, with a portion of revenues earmarked for reforestation, tracked on-chain.\n\nStrengths? The project is dripping with innovation—bridging OSS with creative industries, targeting underrepresented regions, and building open-source tools that could be forked and scaled. The educational and localization focus is a big plus for onboarding new users and expanding the OSS contributor base. The open-source repo is public, and the team’s got verifiable credentials. The plan for an SDK and open templates is a solid move for maximizing impact.\n\nBut let’s not get lost in the cinematic hype. Weaknesses? The impact is still highly localized—Bhutan is a small market, and while the model is “replicable,” there’s no hard evidence yet of global adoption or interest outside the initial region. The project’s complexity (tokenomics, DAOs, NFTs, AI workflows, education, climate) risks spreading resources thin and slowing down delivery. There’s also a lack of concrete metrics for measuring OSS adoption, user growth, or actual ecosystem impact. The climate-positive component, while noble, is a nice-to-have—not a core driver of OSS or dApp adoption at scale. And, crucially, there’s no deployer address or evidence of smart contracts live on-chain yet—so we’re still in the pre-launch, pre-impact phase.\n\nRequested changes: The team needs to show hard numbers and clear metrics for OSS adoption, user onboarding, and ecosystem impact. They should prioritize shipping core dApp features and open-source modules before expanding into climate or AI side quests. A roadmap with milestones, timelines, and public testnet deployments is a must. And let’s see some evidence of demand or partnerships outside Bhutan to prove this thing can scale. Max utility, max impact—don’t get bogged down in local optimization or feature creep.\n\nBottom line: Dharma Code is a bold, innovative play with OSS at its heart, but it needs to prove it can scale and deliver real, measurable impact beyond its initial niche. Show us the code, show us the users, and let’s see this thing go global.",
