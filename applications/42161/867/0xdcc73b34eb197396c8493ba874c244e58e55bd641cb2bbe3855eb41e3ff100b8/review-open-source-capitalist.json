  "summary": "The Dharma Code is a Web3-powered platform aimed at revolutionizing the film industry by integrating blockchain technology for decentralized film financing, governance, and community engagement. It focuses on underrepresented regions like Bhutan, offering open-source tools, educational resources, and a replicable framework for creative economies. The project emphasizes cultural inclusivity, language accessibility, and environmental sustainability, aiming to bridge the gap between tradition and technology.",
  "review": "The Dharma Code project presents a compelling vision for integrating blockchain technology into the creative industries, particularly in underrepresented regions like Bhutan. The application highlights several strengths, including its focus on open-source tools for decentralized creative production, educational initiatives, and language inclusivity. The project aims to expand the OSS ecosystem by developing blockchain-native tools tailored to cultural production and creating localized educational resources. However, the application lacks specific details on the implementation of these initiatives, such as the technical specifications of the smart contracts and the governance frameworks. Additionally, while the project emphasizes cultural and environmental sustainability, it does not provide a clear plan for measuring the impact of these efforts. The application could benefit from a more detailed roadmap and metrics for success to ensure the project's scalability and long-term impact.",
