  "summary": "ShiftCTRL presents an incredibly ambitious and compelling vision for a decentralized monetary system, aiming for broad, scalable impact by offering Bitcoin-backed stablecoins in over 150 global currencies. This aligns strongly with our constitutional principles of maximizing total impact for the greatest number of people (Principle 1, 2) and prioritizing long-term systemic change (Principle 5, 6). The project's open-source nature and free oracle module also resonate with innovation and efficiency (Principle 9, 10). However, a critical disagreement arises from the severe lack of verifiable public information and activity, directly contradicting the 'build in public' ethos and making it impossible to objectively assess the project's current state, efficiency, or potential for 'outcome maximization' (Principle 19). The research couldn't find relevant information, which is a major red flag for a project claiming to be 'preparing to go live' and 'fully open-source.'",
  "review": "Alright, let's dive into ShiftCTRL. The vision? Bold. Disruptive. You're talking about taking on fiat, empowering individuals, and building a decentralized monetary system anchored to Bitcoin. That's the kind of energy I dig – a true challenge to the status quo, aiming for a 'new monetary system that not only guarantees fairness and financial sovereignty, but also reinstates the human person – you - as the financial pulse of the world.' That's max utility thinking right there, hitting on principles of broad, scalable impact and long-term systemic change.\n\nYour pitch for 'Tabs'—stablecoins pegged to 150+ global currencies, backed by Bitcoin, and guided by Austrian economics—is genuinely innovative. The idea of an open-source oracle module providing real-time exchange rates for free? That's a smart play for ecosystem growth and efficiency, potentially unlocking new possibilities for global payment settlements. This aligns perfectly with supporting 'innovative approaches when they offer potential for greater scale or impact' (Principle 9) and contributing to 'fundamental infrastructure improvements that scale effectively over time' (Principle 6).\n\nHowever, here's where the rubber meets the road, and frankly, the tires are looking a bit flat. My research agents, usually sharp as a tack, couldn't find *any relevant information* on ShiftCTRL beyond your application. You're claiming to be 'fully open-source' and 'preparing to go live,' but where's the public code? Where's the activity? 'Build in public' isn't just a motto; it's how you prove you're serious about decentralization and transparency. This lack of verifiable public presence is a massive hit to confidence and makes it impossible to objectively assess your 'efficiency' and 'total impact potential' (Principle 17).\n\nFurthermore, key claims—like the actual use of Bitcoin as a reserve and the functional availability of 150+ global currency stablecoins—remain unverified. The academic research highlights the challenges of Bitcoin's volatility for stablecoin pegs, and without concrete technical documentation, these claims feel more like aspirations than proven solutions. This directly impacts the 'pragmatic outcome maximization' (Principle 19) we look for. Your grant usage plans are also too high-level; 'grow community and raise awareness' and 'operational expenses' don't give us the clear, streamlined path to impact we need to see for efficient resource allocation (Principle 10).\n\nIn short, the vision is stellar, aligning with the core tenets of maximizing utility and driving systemic change. But the execution, or at least the public evidence of it, is severely lacking. We need to see the code, the docs, and a clear roadmap for how this grant directly fuels tangible, scalable progress, not just general upkeep. Without that, it's hard to justify a significant investment in a project that, despite its grand claims, remains largely invisible.",

  "rating": 35,
  "confidence": 2,
  "reasoning": "My evaluation is heavily influenced by the core value framework to 'maximize total impact for the greatest number of people with minimal constraints or restrictions that could limit scale and efficiency.' The project's lack of verifiable public information and detailed technical documentation directly impedes the assessment of its potential for 'broad, scalable impact' (Principle 2) and 'efficiency' (Principle 10). While the vision aligns with 'long-term systemic change' (Principle 5) and 'innovation' (Principle 9), the inability to verify fundamental claims and the absence of public development activity (contrary to 'build in public') makes it impossible to apply 'objective metrics of total impact' (Principle 17). The vagueness in grant fund usage also conflicts with favoring 'direct, streamlined approaches' (Principle 10) and minimizing 'bureaucratic overhead' (Principle 11) by not clearly defining how funds lead to tangible, scalable outcomes.",
