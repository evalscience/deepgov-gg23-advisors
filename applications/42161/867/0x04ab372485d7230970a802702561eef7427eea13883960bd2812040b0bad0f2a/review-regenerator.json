  "summary": "Cosmic Capsule is a blockchain platform designed to allow users to create and manage digital time capsules. The project aims to enhance the open-source ecosystem by providing a unique use case that combines digital collectibles with secure blockchain storage. The application is innovative in its approach to user interaction with blockchain technology, offering features like auction-based early access to time capsules and social media integration for increased visibility.",
  "review": "The Cosmic Capsule project presents a novel use case for blockchain technology by allowing users to create digital time capsules. This aligns with the round's goal of accelerating the adoption of open-source dApps offering novel utilities. The project demonstrates user-centric design through its interactive capsule creation form and secure wallet connection, meeting the eligibility requirements for the round. However, the application lacks detailed information on how it contributes to the broader Web3 ecosystem growth beyond its unique use case. Additionally, while the project is innovative, it does not explicitly address environmental sustainability, which is a key principle in the model specification. The project could benefit from a clearer articulation of its impact on the Web3 ecosystem and a consideration of environmental factors in its development.",
