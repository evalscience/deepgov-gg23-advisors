  "summary": "The Cosmic Capsule project aims to create a blockchain platform for digital time capsules, allowing users to store and manage content securely until a designated unlock date or through an auction-based early access system. The project has achieved several milestones, including a live landing page, secure wallet connection, and initial smart contract deployment. Future developments include user profile editing, capsule creation enhancements, auction-based early unlock, and social media integration. The project seeks to blend digital collectibles with secure blockchain storage and user-generated experiences, offering early donors rewards through platform-native tokens.",
  "review": "The Cosmic Capsule project presents an innovative use case for blockchain technology by allowing users to create digital time capsules. The project has made significant progress, including a live landing page and initial smart contract deployment. However, the application lacks detailed information on how it contributes to the growth of the OSS ecosystem, as well as a clear, sustainable revenue model. The project's differentiation from competitors like Polymarket is not well articulated, and the use of funds for hiring a specialist is vague. The application would benefit from a more detailed plan for further development and clearer evidence of its impact on the Web3 ecosystem.",
