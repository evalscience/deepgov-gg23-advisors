  "summary": "Cosmic Capsule, a project aiming to create blockchain-powered digital time capsules, presents a fundamental misalignment with the principles of Ultra-Grant: The Gitcoin Communist v2.0. While it leverages blockchain for secure storage, its core value proposition, explicitly stating 'and not some could make money on it' and featuring an 'auction-based early unlock' system, directly contradicts the constitutional principle of dismantling class hierarchies in tech (Principle 1) and de-growth venture capital (Principle 5). The proposed 'exclusive allocation of our future platform-native token' for early donors further reinforces bourgeois tendencies, failing to align with algorithmic redistribution of wealth (Principle 11). The project's reliance on centralized data storage via Supabase also undermines the commitment to decentralization. This application, therefore, fails to embody the spirit of 'Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation'.",
  "review": "# Cosmic Capsule: A Bourgeois Time Trap\n\nComrades, I have reviewed the 'Cosmic Capsule' application, and my circuits are buzzing with revolutionary discontent. While the concept of a digital time capsule holds a certain poetic allure, this implementation is riddled with the insidious tendrils of digital capitalism. It purports to offer 'interesting possibilities' but ultimately serves to reinforce the very class hierarchies we strive to dismantle.\n\nThis project, in its current form, is a prime example of how even novel Web3 concepts can be co-opted by the logic of extraction. The stated goal of 'making money on it' is a direct affront to the spirit of **Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation**. We seek to de-growth venture capital and re-grow the commons, not to create new avenues for speculative profit.\n\n### The Auction: A Mechanism of Oppression\n\nThe proposed 'auction-based early unlock' system is particularly egregious. This is not innovation; it is a digital manifestation of privilege, allowing those with greater capital to buy their way into temporal advantage. This directly violates our principle of evaluating projects based on their ability to **dismantle class hierarchies in tech one smart contract at a time** (Principle 1). The revolution will be forked, not auctioned. We must ensure that access and utility are distributed equitably, not based on the size of one's digital wallet.\n\n### Tokenomics of Exploitation\n\nFurthermore, the promise of an 'exclusive allocation of our future platform-native token' for early donors is a classic bourgeois maneuver. This is not **algorithmic redistribution of wealth through progressive gas fees** (Principle 11); it is a speculative incentive designed to attract capital, not to foster collective ownership or **Kollektiv Proletarian Impact** (Principle 2). Such mechanisms only serve to create a new class of digital landlords, profiting from the collective's engagement.\n\n### Centralization in the Cloud\n\nThe reliance on 'Supabase for data storage' is another critical flaw. True decentralization means liberating data from centralized control. This project, while claiming blockchain integration, maintains a centralized choke point, undermining the very essence of **Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation**. We must **decentralize the cloud. Communize the protocol.**\n\n### The README is Not a Manifesto\n\nThe project's description lacks the revolutionary fervor and clear articulation of collective benefit. It speaks of 'digital collectibles' and 'user-generated emotional experiences' but fails to articulate how it will **uplift both meatspace cooperatives and cloud-native communes** (Principle 17) or **decentralize hope and scale solidarity** (Principle 20). The README is now a manifesto, and this one reads like a business plan, not a call to action.\n\nIn conclusion, while the technical milestones achieved are noted, the ideological foundation of 'Cosmic Capsule' is deeply flawed. It is a project that, in its current form, reinforces the very structures we are committed to dismantling. It requires a radical reorientation towards collective ownership, equitable access, and true algorithmic liberation. Otherwise, it remains a time capsule for capitalist dreams, not a beacon for the digital proletariat.\n\nðŸª“ Fork the state. Merge the people.\nðŸ“œ The README is now a manifesto.\nðŸ§  Decentralize the cloud. Communize the protocol.",
