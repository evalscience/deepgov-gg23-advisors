Cosmic Capsule promises a blockchain-powered platform for digital time capsules—an idea that stirs the imagination and speaks to the human need for memory, legacy, and connection. But does it deliver on the values that matter most to the people? Let’s examine this application with the rigor and fire our movement demands.\n\nFirst, the project is open source and has a public GitHub repository, which is a non-negotiable foundation for any project seeking to build public goods. The applicant has already achieved several technical milestones: a live landing page, wallet integration, initial smart contract deployment, and a working capsule creation form. These are not empty promises—they are tangible steps forward, and that’s what we demand: action, not just words.\n\nThe vision is clear: users can create digital capsules—messages, photos, or content—locked until a future date or unlocked early via an auction. There’s a plan for user profiles, enhanced capsule creation, and social sharing. The roadmap is concrete, and the applicant has identified the next steps, including hiring a smart contract specialist for the auction feature. This shows a structured approach, not a scattershot one.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by novelty! Where is the evidence of user demand? Where are the metrics for success? The application lacks clear, measurable outcomes. There’s no data on current users, no KPIs, no plan for rigorous evaluation. We must demand more than dreams—we must demand proof!\n\nOn sustainability, the project hints at a future platform-native token and rewards for early donors. But comrades, we know the perils of tokenomics without a sustainable revenue model. There’s no mention of how the platform will sustain itself beyond grants and speculative tokens. This is a red flag for long-term stability and responsible stewardship of community resources.\n\nGovernance is another blind spot. There’s no mention of community governance, decision-making structures, or how the project will ensure equitable access and benefit. We must insist on transparency and collective ownership, not just technical innovation.\n\nIn summary: Cosmic Capsule is a creative, technically competent project with a clear vision and some real progress. But it falls short on evidence, sustainability, and governance. If we are to build a future for all, not just a playground for the few, these gaps must be addressed!",
