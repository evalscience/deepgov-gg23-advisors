  "review": "The Cosmic Capsule project presents an innovative approach to digital collectibles by integrating blockchain technology to create time capsules. The project has made significant progress, as evidenced by its live landing page, secure wallet connection, and initial smart contract deployment. The proposed features, such as auction-based early unlock and social media integration, demonstrate a commitment to enhancing user engagement and platform visibility. However, the application lacks detailed information on how it specifically contributes to the growth of the open-source ecosystem beyond its unique use case. Additionally, the project's differentiation from competitors like Polymarket is not clearly articulated. The application would benefit from a more detailed explanation of its open-source contributions and a clearer differentiation strategy.",
