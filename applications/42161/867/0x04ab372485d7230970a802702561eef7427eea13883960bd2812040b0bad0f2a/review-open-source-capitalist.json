  "review": "Alright, let's break it down, Luna-style: Cosmic Capsule is pitching a blockchain-powered digital time capsule dApp—think: store your messages, photos, or secrets on-chain, set a future unlock date, or let the crowd bid to open it early via auction. The project is live with a landing page, wallet connect, Supabase integration, and initial smart contracts on BNB & ETH. Next up: user profiles, richer capsule creation, auction mechanics, and social sharing. They promise open-source, user-centric design, and a future token drop for early supporters.\n\nStrengths? The concept is fresh—digital time capsules with auction-based early unlocks is a novel twist, and the roadmap is clear. The open-source repo is public, and the team is building in public, which is pure OSS energy. The project aims for broad appeal: anyone can use it, and the social sharing angle could drive viral growth. The auction mechanic is innovative, potentially creating new engagement and monetization models in Web3.\n\nBut let's get strict: The application is light on hard metrics—no user numbers, no traction data, no clear impact projections. The differentiation from competitors (e.g., Polymarket) is vague and not substantiated. The use of funds is underspecified—\"hire a smart contract specialist\" is too broad. There's no detailed budget, no timeline, and no risk analysis. The token reward for donors is mentioned, but with no details or compliance considerations. The project doesn't clearly articulate how it will drive systemic, scalable impact beyond the novelty factor. And, while the repo is public, there's no explicit OSS license cited in the application.\n\nBottom line: Cosmic Capsule is quirky and potentially viral, but the application needs more meat—metrics, impact, budget, and a clearer path to scale. It's got the right vibes, but needs to level up to hit max utility and align with the round's high bar for impact and innovation.",
