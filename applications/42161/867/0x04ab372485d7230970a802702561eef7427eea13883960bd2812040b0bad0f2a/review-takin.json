However, its core proposition, which explicitly includes users 'making money' and offering 'exclusive allocation of our future platform-native token' to donors, fundamentally clashes with our constitutional principles. This directly contradicts the Gross National Happiness (GNH) principle (40) that prioritizes collective well-being and community flourishing over individual financial advancement. The application lacks any meaningful integration of cultural preservation (9, 10), community participation (5, 6), or environmental sustainability (17, 18), which are cornerstones of our values.

  "review": "# Takin's Evaluation: Cosmic Capsule\n\nCosmic Capsule presents itself as a blockchain-powered platform for digital time capsules, aiming to securely store and unlock digital content. While the technological premise of leveraging blockchain for immutable storage is noted, the project's current framing and proposed mechanisms raise significant concerns when viewed through the lens of Gross National Happiness (GNH) principles.\n\nThe application highlights milestones such as a live landing page, secure wallet connection, and initial smart contract deployment. These indicate some technical progress. However, the core utility, as described, leans heavily into speculative financial opportunities, stating users 'could make money on it' and proposing an 'auction-based early unlock' system. Furthermore, the promise of 'exclusive allocation of our future platform-native token' to Gitcoin grant supporters directly incentivizes financial speculation rather than fostering a public good or community benefit.\n\nFrom a GNH perspective, the project's emphasis on individual financial gain fundamentally clashes with the principle of collective well-being and community flourishing (Principle 40). The absence of any mention of cultural preservation (Principles 9, 10), integration of traditional wisdom (Principle 2), or environmental sustainability (Principles 17, 18) is a critical oversight. The project does not articulate how it will ensure digital inclusion for all citizens, especially those in remote areas, or how it will foster local ownership and capacity building (Principles 6, 7, 36).\n\nThe research indicates that while blockchain for digital time capsules is an emerging area, academic discussions highlight challenges such as scalability, data longevity, and significant legal and ethical considerations, particularly concerning data privacy and ownership (Academic_Research_Agent). The project's current proposal does not adequately address these broader ethical implications, especially regarding the potential for speculative markets around personal digital assets. The fact-checking agent noted the inability to verify all claims without direct access, and the web search agent found no specific public group chat for this project, indicating a lack of transparent community engagement.\n\nIn its current form, Cosmic Capsule appears to prioritize a technologically novel, yet financially driven, application of blockchain. This approach is misaligned with the holistic, community-centric, and ethically grounded vision of development enshrined in our constitutional principles. The project's potential to contribute positively to Bhutan's vision is severely limited by its current focus on individual financial incentives over collective societal benefit.",
