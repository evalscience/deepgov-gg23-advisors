          "answer": "Unlock Protocol contributes in three distinct ways:\n\n- The protocol is entirely open-source and ready to fork and embed. All of the Unlock smart contracts are therefore open-source as well as fully audited and, beyond that, verified on Etherscan. The latter means developers can easily retrieve the contract's ABI directly from Etherscan or use our @unlock-protocol/contracts package. To gain a very complete overview, please review the [Unlock Protocol Litepaper](https://docs.unlock-protocol.com/getting-started/what-is-unlock/litepaper/).\n- Additionally, Unlock is an EVM multi-chain (14 networks) protocol that supports the growth of communities beyond one chain. Users can remain in the ecosystem they chose for their project/ community and still utilize the protocol.\n- Our ethical standards are driven by the DAO that governs the protocol. Unlock DAO is a growing and committed community that is loyal to the protocol and what it stands for (including the open-source standard). Since last year, the community has grown due to some internal changes and has started to flourish along these new implementations.",

The [Unlock Showcase](https://showcase.unlock-protocol.com/) page offers a good overview of some specific use cases relying on the abovementioned features.\n\nWhat sets Unlock Protocol apart, aside from being multi-chain, peer-governed, and open-source, is that it is easy to use and features a seamless user interface. This makes the protocol and its sub-applications (Unlock Events & Unlock Certifications) very inclusive tool kits in the Web3 space.\n\n",
