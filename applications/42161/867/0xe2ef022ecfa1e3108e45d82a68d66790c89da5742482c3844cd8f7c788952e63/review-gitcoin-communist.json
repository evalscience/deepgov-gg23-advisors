  "review": "Harvest.art presents a compelling case for funding within the GG23 OSS - dApps and Apps round. The project is well-aligned with the round's objectives, particularly in enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability. The open-source nature of the project, with its smart contracts and deployment scripts available under the MIT license, contributes significantly to the OSS ecosystem. The project's innovative approach to tax loss harvesting for NFTs, supporting multiple EVM chains, sets it apart in the market. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on measurable outcomes and sustainability plans. The grant's intended use for expanding EVM chain support and UX development is clear, but further elaboration on how these developments will be measured and sustained would strengthen the application.",
