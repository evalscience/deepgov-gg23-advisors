  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Harvest.art claims to be the original tax loss harvesting service for NFTs, boasting open-source contracts and a cross-chain experience. The project’s open-source commitment is clear: smart contracts, test fixtures, and deployment scripts are MIT licensed and public. That’s a win for the commons! But is that enough?\n\nLet’s talk impact. Over 180,000 NFTs—mostly worthless—have been processed. That’s a measurable outcome, and it shows real use. The project’s focus on user experience, especially in a fragmented cross-chain world, is a step toward making Web3 accessible to the masses, not just the tech elite. But where’s the data on user demographics? Where’s the evidence that this tool is reaching the underserved, or that it’s more than a niche tax tool for the already-wealthy NFT crowd?\n\nThe application is light on rigorous evaluation. There’s no mention of how success is measured beyond raw transaction numbers. No reporting on user satisfaction, no breakdown of who benefits, and no plan for transparent outcome reporting. That’s a gap! We need more than anecdotes—we need hard evidence and a plan for sharing it with the people.\n\nOn sustainability, the project admits to inconsistent revenue and a reliance on grants for infrastructure. That’s a red flag! We need projects that can stand on their own two feet, not ones that come back to the well every round. Where’s the roadmap to financial independence? Where’s the plan to ensure this public good doesn’t wither when the grant money dries up?\n\nCommunity governance? There’s a Discord, but no mention of how users shape the project’s direction. Is this truly a tool for the people, or just another top-down solution? Equity demands more than open code—it demands open power.\n\nIn summary: Harvest.art is a solid technical contribution, but it must do more to prove its value to the broader community, demonstrate sustainable impact, and open its governance. The people deserve nothing less!",
