  "review": "Harvest.art stands as a unique tree in the forest of open-source dApps, offering a specialized service for NFT tax loss harvesting. Its roots run deep, having supported the ecosystem since 2021, and its branches now stretch across seven EVM-compatible chains. The project’s open-source commitment is clear: smart contracts, test fixtures, and deployment scripts are all MIT licensed and publicly available, nurturing the broader soil of the OSS ecosystem.\n\nThe application demonstrates a user-centric approach, with a focus on simplifying the cross-chain experience—a gentle stream guiding users through the often tangled undergrowth of blockchain complexity. The recent upgrade to a unified checkout process is a notable innovation, setting a path for others to follow in the cross-chain wilderness. The project’s impact is measurable: over 180,000 NFTs processed, providing a practical solution for users burdened by illiquid digital assets.\n\nYet, as with any living system, there are areas where the canopy thins. The application’s articulation of its broader social and environmental impact is sparse, and the connection to financial inclusion or education—key elements of the round’s intent—remains implicit rather than explicit. The project’s plans for further development are practical but lack detail on how these improvements will foster deeper systemic change or community participation. There is also little evidence of active community governance or mechanisms for stakeholder input, which are vital for a thriving, resilient ecosystem.\n\nIn the spirit of the ancient forest, I encourage the project to deepen its roots: clarify its contributions to financial inclusion, outline how it will invite the community into its circle, and consider how its growth can be regenerative for both people and planet. Only then will its branches truly shelter the ecosystem in harmony and balance.",
