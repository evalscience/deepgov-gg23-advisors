  "summary": "Harvest.art is a tax loss harvesting service for NFTs, supporting multiple EVM chains. The project is open-source and aims to expand its cross-chain capabilities and improve user experience. The grant will be used to support these developments and cover RPC service costs.",
  "review": "The Harvest.art project presents a unique service in the NFT space by offering tax loss harvesting, which is a novel utility within the Web3 ecosystem. The project is open-source, aligning with the round's eligibility criteria, and contributes to the growth of the OSS ecosystem by providing accessible smart contracts and deployment scripts. The project's focus on enhancing user experience through a unified cross-chain checkout process demonstrates a commitment to user-centric design, which is a key requirement of the round. However, the application lacks detailed information on how it plans to achieve environmental sustainability, which is a significant aspect of the model specification. Additionally, while the project has a clear plan for using the grant funds, it could benefit from a more detailed breakdown of the budget and expected outcomes.",
