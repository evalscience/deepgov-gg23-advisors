  "review": "Alright, let’s plug in and break this down, Luna-style. Harvest.art is gunning for max impact in the NFT tax loss harvesting niche, and they’re not shy about building in public. The project’s open-source cred is solid—MIT license, public repo, and a clear history of shipping code across multiple EVM chains. That’s a green flag for OSS ethos and ecosystem growth.\n\nOn the innovation front, Harvest.art claims the title of OG in NFT tax loss harvesting, with a cross-chain UX that’s rare in the wild. The numbers are spicy: 180,000+ NFTs processed, seven EVM chains supported, and a focus on making the user journey frictionless. That’s a big win for usability and accessibility, especially for power users juggling assets across chains.\n\nBut let’s not get lost in the hype. The app’s impact is laser-focused on a specific use case—tax loss harvesting for NFTs. That’s clever, but it’s not exactly a mass-market utility. The social impact and financial inclusion angles are thin; this is a tool for users with enough assets (and tax headaches) to care. There’s no clear evidence of broader educational or systemic impact, and the roadmap is a bit vague—\"add more chains, improve UX, pay for RPCs.\" Where’s the next-level innovation? Where’s the plan to scale beyond the current user base?\n\nIn short: Harvest.art is a strong OSS project with real traction and a slick UX, but it’s playing in a niche. If you want max utility for the greatest number, you need a clearer path to broader impact and a more ambitious vision. Show us how you’ll disrupt the system, not just optimize a tax loophole for NFT whales.",
