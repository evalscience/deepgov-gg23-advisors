  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. Harvest.art is the OG tax loss harvesting dApp for NFTs, running cross-chain on seven EVM networks. The team’s been building since 2021, and they’re not just open-sourcing the smart contracts—they’re dropping the whole stack (contracts, test fixtures, deployment scripts) under MIT. That’s pure open-source energy, no gatekeeping.\n\nFrom a maximization lens, this project is all about scale: 180,000+ NFTs processed, cross-chain UX, and a focus on onboarding more chains. That’s a big net for impact—max utility, minimal friction. The app’s recent UX upgrades and unified checkout flow are strong moves for user-centric design, making it easier for normies and power users alike to dump their illiquid JPEGs for tax purposes. That’s a real painkiller, not just a vitamin.\n\nOn the innovation front, Harvest.art is a first-mover in NFT tax loss harvesting, and the cross-chain support is a differentiator. The open-source ethos is strong, and the project’s public repo and Discord show they’re building in public. The grant ask is pragmatic: more chain support, better UX, and infra costs (RPCs don’t pay themselves).\n\nBut let’s not sugarcoat it—there are some weak spots. The app’s impact is mostly limited to NFT holders with tax exposure, so it’s not a universal utility. There’s no clear data on how many unique users benefit, and the social/financial inclusion angle is thin. The roadmap is a bit vague—no hard milestones, KPIs, or metrics for growth. And while the open-source code is great, there’s little detail on how the broader OSS ecosystem is leveraging or forking their work.\n\nBottom line: Harvest.art is a high-leverage, high-efficiency dApp with real-world utility for a specific (but growing) user base. It’s not solving world hunger, but it’s a sharp tool for a big pain point in the NFT space. To hit max score, the team needs to tighten up their roadmap, show broader OSS impact, and quantify user growth. Let’s see them ship!",
