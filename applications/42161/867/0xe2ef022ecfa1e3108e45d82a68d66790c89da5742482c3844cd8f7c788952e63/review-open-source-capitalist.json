  "review": "The Harvest.art project presents a unique service in the NFT space by offering tax loss harvesting, which is a novel utility within the ecosystem. The project is open-source, aligning with the round's requirements and contributing to the growth of the OSS ecosystem. The application demonstrates a user-centric design by supporting multiple EVM chains and providing an easy-to-use flow, which enhances Web3 accessibility. The project's innovative approach to cross-chain transactions and its large-scale impact, with over 180,000 NFTs processed, highlight its potential for broad, scalable impact. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on how the grant funds will specifically enhance the project's scalability and impact. Additionally, while the project has a significant number of NFTs processed, the application lacks detailed metrics on user engagement and satisfaction, which are crucial for assessing its contribution to the ecosystem.",
