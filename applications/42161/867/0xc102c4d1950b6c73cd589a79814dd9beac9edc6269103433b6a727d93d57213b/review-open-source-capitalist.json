  "review": "Alright, let’s cut through the noise and get to the alpha. Event Horizon is a public-access metagovernance pool that’s already live, scaling up DAO participation for the little guys—retail voters who usually get rekt by low voting power. The project’s got serious traction: $500M+ in voting power mobilized, partnerships with Gitcoin, Arbitrum, and Compound, and a unique AI-powered governance agent system. That’s not just talk, that’s on-chain action.\n\nFrom a maximization lens, this is a textbook case: Event Horizon amplifies the voices of thousands, not just whales or insiders. The implicit delegation model is a clever game-theoretic hack—when participation is low, each voter gets a bigger slice, incentivizing more users to jump in. When it’s high, the pie is split, but the ecosystem wins with more engagement. That’s scalable, systemic impact, not just a local patch.\n\nInnovation? Check. The AI voting agents and metagovernance dashboard are next-level, pushing the UX of DAO governance into the future. The project is open source, aligns with OSS values, and is laser-focused on utility maximization. The roadmap is clear: more AI, more data, more users, and more DAOs onboarded. Funds are earmarked for technical expansion and marketing—no fluff, just growth levers.\n\nBut let’s not get blinded by the moon math. There are some weak spots. The application is heavy on vision and traction, but light on hard, objective metrics for future impact. There’s not enough detail on how the AI agents work, how they’re audited, or how sybil resistance is enforced at scale. The open-source repo is listed, but transparency on code audits, security, and community contributions is thin. Also, while the project claims to be the only public-access metagovernance solution, more comparative analysis with competitors would help validate that edge.\n\nBottom line: Event Horizon is a high-impact, high-velocity project with real-world traction and a clear path to scaling. But to hit max utility and secure top-tier funding, the team needs to tighten up on transparency, security, and measurable KPIs. Build in public, show your receipts, and let’s see those metrics on-chain!",
