  "summary": "Event Horizon is a public-access metagovernance pool designed to empower smaller voters within DAOs by providing them with significant voting power. The project has mobilized over $500 million in voting power across multiple DAOs, offering free AI tools and voting agents to enhance governance UX. The grant seeks to expand these models and increase marketing efforts to raise awareness of these public goods.",
  "review": "The Event Horizon project presents a compelling case for enhancing DAO governance by enfranchising smaller, retail voters through its metagovernance pool. The project has demonstrated significant traction, mobilizing over $500 million in voting power and partnering with major DAOs like Gitcoin and Arbitrum. The use of AI tools to automate voting and educate users is innovative and aligns with the round's focus on enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability. However, the application lacks detailed information on the project's open-source contributions and specific plans for the use of grant funds, which are critical for assessing its alignment with the round's eligibility criteria and the model specification's emphasis on transparency and efficiency.",
