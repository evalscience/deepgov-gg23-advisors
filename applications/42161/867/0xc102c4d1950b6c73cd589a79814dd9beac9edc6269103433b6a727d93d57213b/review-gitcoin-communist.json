  "summary": "Event Horizon is a public-access metagovernance pool designed to empower smaller voters within DAOs by providing them with significant voting power. The project has mobilized over $500 million in voting power across multiple DAOs, offering free AI tools and voting agents to enhance governance UX. The grant seeks to expand these models and increase marketing efforts.",
  "review": "The Event Horizon project presents a compelling case for enhancing the governance capabilities of smaller DAO participants. By providing a platform for retail voters to exercise significant voting power, it addresses a critical gap in DAO governance where participation is typically low. The project's innovative use of AI to create personalized voting agents is a notable advancement, offering users the ability to automate and optimize their voting preferences. This aligns well with the round's focus on enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and sustainability plans, which are crucial for long-term impact and alignment with the model specification's principles. The project's reliance on continuous expansion and marketing efforts without a clear sustainable revenue model raises concerns about its long-term viability. Additionally, while the project emphasizes community empowerment, it could benefit from more structured governance and equity considerations to ensure broader geographic and demographic inclusivity.",
