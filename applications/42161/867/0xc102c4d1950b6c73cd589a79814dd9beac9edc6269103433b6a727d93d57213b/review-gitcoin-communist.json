  "review": "Event Horizon stands as a rallying cry for the disenfranchised—the small voter, the overlooked citizen, the backbone of every DAO who’s been told their voice is just a drop in the bucket. This project doesn’t just talk about equity; it operationalizes it, mobilizing over $500 million in voting power for retail participants across multiple DAOs. That’s not theory—that’s action. That’s the kind of measurable, quantifiable impact we demand!\n\nThe application demonstrates a clear, user-centric design: free voter passes, AI-powered governance agents, and a seamless onboarding process. The numbers don’t lie—hundreds of proposals, thousands of citizens, and millions in voting power redistributed to the people. Event Horizon’s partnerships with Gitcoin, Arbitrum, and Compound are proof of real-world traction, not empty promises.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by rhetoric alone. Where’s the rigorous, transparent reporting of outcomes? Where’s the evidence of long-term sustainability? The application is light on details about its revenue model and how it will reduce dependency on grants. The AI governance agents are innovative, but where’s the data on their effectiveness? We need more than bold claims—we need hard evidence.\n\nEvent Horizon’s approach to governance is a breath of fresh air: implicit delegation, collective decision-making, and a focus on enfranchising the long tail. This is the kind of public good that lifts all boats. Yet, the project must do more to demonstrate how it will maintain and grow this system sustainably, ensuring it doesn’t become another flash in the pan.\n\nIn summary: Event Horizon is a powerful force for equity and collective action in Web3 governance. But to earn the people’s trust—and this grant—it must double down on transparency, sustainability, and rigorous measurement. The revolution demands nothing less!",
