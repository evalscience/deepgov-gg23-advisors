  "summary": "Event Horizon is a dApp focused on enhancing DAO governance through metagovernance pools and AI-powered voting agents. It strongly aligns with the constitutional principles of **Community Participation and Inclusion** (Principles 5, 6, 7, 8) by empowering retail voters and fostering decentralized decision-making. Its use of transparent digital tools also supports **Ethical Governance** (Principle 13). However, the project shows significant gaps in aligning with **Cultural Heritage and Identity** (Principles 9-12) and **Environmental Harmony** (Principles 17-20), as it does not explicitly address these aspects. Furthermore, the privacy implications of its AI agents require clarification to fully meet **Ethical Use of AI** (Principle 14) standards, and its success metrics do not yet encompass **Holistic Well-being Indicators** (Principle 35) as envisioned by Gross National Happiness principles.",
  "review": "Event Horizon presents an innovative approach to addressing voter apathy and centralizing influence within Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Its core offering of public-access metagovernance pools and free AI-powered voting agents directly enhances **citizen participation in decision-making processes** (Principle 5) by enfranchising low-capital, high-conviction citizens. This aligns strongly with the constitutional value of **community engagement and citizen participation** over top-down approaches. The project's success in mobilizing significant voting power across multiple DAOs, including partnerships with Gitcoin and Arbitrum, demonstrates its practical impact on increasing **meaningful retail participation** (Principle 6) and fostering **local ownership and capacity building** within communities (Principle 7) by empowering individual voters.\n\nThe use of blockchain and digital tools for transparent governance processes is a clear strength, aligning with **Principle 13** (transparent, accountable governance). The AI agents, serving as educational tools to summarize proposals and synthesize perspectives, also contribute to **accessible education** (Principle 31) and promote **critical thinking and innovation** (Principle 33) within the governance space. This fosters stronger **community bonds and social cohesion** (Principle 37) by enabling more voices to be heard.\n\nHowever, the application falls short in several areas critical to the Gross National Happiness (GNH) framework. There is no explicit mention or strategy for **preserving and promoting cultural heritage** (Principles 9-12) or **integrating traditional wisdom** (Principle 2) with modern solutions. The project's focus is purely on Web3 governance, without addressing how it would harmonize with Bhutanese cultural identity or local languages (Principle 30). Furthermore, while it contributes to collective well-being in a governance context (Principle 40), it lacks explicit alignment with broader GNH principles (Principle 39) and does not propose **holistic well-being indicators** for success measurement (Principle 35).\n\nA significant concern arises from the AI agents' ability to 'learn each user's preferences and personality to automatically vote in their proxy.' While convenient, this raises questions about **citizen privacy and ethical use of AI** (Principle 14). The application does not detail the safeguards in place to protect user data or prevent potential biases or manipulation. This automatic proxy voting could also subtly undermine the spirit of active, informed participation and critical thinking (Principle 5, 33) if users rely solely on automation rather than engaging directly. Lastly, the project does not address **environmental sustainability** (Principles 17-20) or **digital inclusion across Bhutan's mountainous geography** (Principle 36), which are vital for a holistic and sustainable development approach.",

  "reasoning": "The Event Horizon project demonstrates strong alignment with several core constitutional principles, particularly those related to **Community Participation and Inclusion** (Principles 5, 6, 7, 8) by enfranchising smaller voters and increasing retail participation in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Its use of digital tools for governance also aligns well with **Transparency and Ethical Governance** (Principles 13, 16) by promoting accessible and accountable decision-making processes. The educational aspect of its AI agents supports **Education and Knowledge Systems** (Principles 31, 33) by making governance more understandable and fostering innovation. Furthermore, its contribution to collective well-being in the Web3 space aligns with **Gross National Happiness Alignment** (Principle 40).\n\nHowever, significant gaps exist in its alignment with other crucial principles. There is a notable absence of explicit consideration for **Cultural Heritage and Identity** (Principles 9, 10, 11, 12) and **Holistic Balance Principles** (Principles 1, 2) which emphasize integrating modern solutions with traditional wisdom and preserving cultural heritage. Similarly, the project lacks a clear commitment to **Environmental Harmony** (Principles 17, 18, 19, 20). The use of AI agents raises concerns regarding **Transparency and Ethical Governance** (Principle 14) due to potential privacy implications of learning user preferences without explicit safeguards. Additionally, the project does not explicitly align with **Gross National Happiness Alignment** (Principle 39) or measure success through **Holistic Progress Measurement** (Principle 35), focusing primarily on quantitative voting metrics rather than broader well-being indicators. The automatic voting feature, while convenient, could also subtly detract from the spirit of active citizen participation and critical thinking (Principle 5, 33) if not carefully managed.",
