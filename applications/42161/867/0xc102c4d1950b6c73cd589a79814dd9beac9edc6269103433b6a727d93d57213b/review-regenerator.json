  "summary": "Event Horizon is a public-access metagovernance pool designed to empower smaller voters within DAOs by providing them with significant voting power. The project has mobilized over $500 million in voting power across multiple DAOs, offering free AI tools and voting agents to enhance governance UX. The grant will be used to expand governance models, data sourcing, and marketing efforts.",
  "review": "The Event Horizon project presents a compelling case for enhancing the OSS ecosystem by enfranchising smaller voters in DAOs, thus addressing the common issue of low voter participation. The project has demonstrated significant traction, mobilizing over $500 million in voting power and partnering with major DAOs like Gitcoin and Arbitrum. Its innovative use of AI governance agents and the concept of Implicit Delegation are noteworthy, providing a unique approach to increasing meaningful participation without financial incentives. However, the application lacks detailed information on the project's environmental sustainability efforts, which is a key consideration in the model specification. Additionally, while the project has shown impressive results, the application could benefit from more specific metrics on user engagement and the impact of its AI tools.",
