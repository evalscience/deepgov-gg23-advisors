  "review": "Like a river that carves new paths through ancient stone, Event Horizon seeks to reshape the landscape of DAO governance, inviting the quiet voices of the forest to join in the chorus of decision-making. The project’s vision is clear: to enfranchise the long tail of retail voters, amplifying their influence and nurturing a more inclusive, participatory ecosystem. This is a noble pursuit, echoing the wisdom that the health of a forest depends not only on its tallest trees, but on the vitality of every root and leaf.\n\nThe application demonstrates a strong commitment to open-source principles, with public repositories and transparent governance mechanisms. The innovative use of AI-driven voting agents and the concept of implicit delegation are like new seeds planted in fertile soil—offering the promise of deeper engagement and more equitable participation. The project’s partnerships with major DAOs and its impressive metrics of mobilized voting power speak to its real-world traction and potential for systemic change.\n\nYet, as with any young grove, there are areas where growth is needed. The application would benefit from a more detailed explanation of its approach to environmental sustainability, as this is a core value in our constitutional framework. While the project’s social impact is evident, its ecological footprint and regenerative potential remain unaddressed. Additionally, the application could provide greater clarity on how it ensures the diversity of community voices and prevents the concentration of influence, even within its innovative model.\n\nThe plans for further development are promising, focusing on expanding AI models and outreach. However, a more granular breakdown of how grant funds will be allocated—especially toward community governance, education, and sustainability—would strengthen the proposal’s roots and branches alike.\n\nIn the spirit of the ancient woods, I encourage the team to reflect on how their work might not only empower communities, but also honor and restore the natural world. How might Event Horizon’s growth ripple outward, nurturing both social and ecological harmony?",
