Event Horizon partnered with several DAOs to create pools of voting power and through Event Horizon's voter pass and metagovernance tooling, each retail voter could mint a voter pass (for free) and have one share of rights in how the pool was used to vote in the base DAO proposal. This was all automated and took minutes from start to finish. \n\nFollowing this, the Event Horizon team found that the generally accepted standard UX of governance was actually quite taxing on the user. To remediate this, Event Horizon built and launched governance agents. Each user can now create (for free) their own personal voting agent.  These agents learn each user's preferences and personality to automatically vote in their proxy on each and every future proposal. Further, the user may use the agent as an education tool to summarize proposals, learn about the governance process, and even synthesize the perspectives of other delegates through forum and social media discourse.\n\nEvent Horizon is the only public access metagovernance solution and the most robust AI governance tool.\n\n",

        "description": "**Event Horizon is a public good, public-access metagovernance pool...** designed to enfranchise the long tail distribution of tens of thousands of smaller voters found within the citizenry of every DAO.\n\n**Metrics & Traction:** Event Horizon is already live within both the Gitcoin and Arbitrum ecosystems and has mobilized >$100,000,000 of voting power across ~500 proposals on over 7 DAOs all on behalf of retail voters at no cost to the user. This is $100,000,000 of voice amplification for the low-capital, high-conviction citizens which would never have been possible prior to the Event Horizon's product. \n\nMost recently, Event Horizon officially partnered with Gitcoin to leverage the Gitcoin Passport and received a 150,000 GTC community delegation:\n\n [Announcement Tweet](https://x.com/EventHorizonDAO/status/1773075757759127818?s=20 )\n\nEvent Horizon also partnered with Arbitrum DAO and now facilitates a 7,000,000 ARB public voting pool for the community: https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegate/0x0edb976ce9b3b08c7e0a20a89bf1bce0e5f99356\n\n\n# More Information:\n**Most DAOs face a problem:** Not enough people care to vote, and those who do care don’t have much influence. Today, typical DAO voter and token participation hovers around 1%. That means 99% of a DAO's governance thought capital is not being used to improve the DAO's collective cognition. Voting when you only have, say, $100 worth of voting power, simply doesn’t make sense, it’s a drop in the bucket. Sitting out governance proposals is, unfortunately, the rational decision but collectively makes everyone worse off. However, given that the strength of the DAO is directly related to the number of participants having their voices heard by the community, this problem needs to be addressed.\n\n**Solution:** Voting is the first step to onboarding new DAO contributors and/or delegates. But without meaningful voting authority, new and existing DAO citizens will remain sidelined and the DAO will remain worse off compared to competitors who optimize top of funnel. \n\nEvent Horizon allows DAO citizens to vote with meaningful authority though is novel governance mechanism: [Implicit Delegation](https://medium.com/hvax/implicit-delegation-event-horizons-governance-solution-3815d61ded12) \n\nEvent Horizon slots into the broader DAO ecosystem in a similar fashion to a standard delegate. However, rather than the pool voting based on the decision of one individual or group, it votes with the collective cognition of hundreds of individual Event Horizon Voter Pass holders. This serves two functions:\n\n1. **Enfranchise Community Citizens:** It provides a clear and designated voice for smaller, retail voters.\n\n2. **Increase Meaningful Retail Participation:** It drives participation through a game theoretic process called Implicit Delegation. Whether 10 people show up to vote, or 10,000 people do, the full retail voter allotment is mobilized in support of the community’s desired outcome:\n\n*When participation is low…* each voter receives a larger slice of the public access pie. This means the fewer people there are voting, the more incentive there is for someone new to come and participate.\n\n*When participation is high…* there are more voters splitting the same pie, however, retail participation is high, which is a great win for the ecosystem.\n\nThis is all done without the need to pay delegates with inflationary token rewards, which would attract the wrong crowd anyway. Event Horizon’s model attracts people strictly interested in governance, not payment.\n\n**DAO Benefits:** From a DAO perspective, Implicit Delegation brings the many great ideas and voices from the long-tail distribution of low-capital community members to the surface. We like to say that the best ideas in an ecosystem are often held in the minds of individuals with $50 in governance voice, so we need a better platform for these ideas to be heard.\n\n\n**Delegate Benefits:** Governance is hard. It is nearly impossible to review, react to, and care about every individual proposal. EH functions as a hive mind to solve this problem. If there are 3 proposals (Gaming, Lending, and Partnership) 100 citizens may show up to vote for each, but the exact voter body may be entirely different each time, with those caring about gaming participating in the gaming proposal, and so on and so forth for the other proposal topics.\n\n# How it Works:\n\n| **Step 0 – Mint:** Any citizen of the DAO ecosystem may [mint](https://eventhorizon.vote/mint) a free voter pass.\n\n| **Step 1 – Duplication:** Once a delegation is established, Event Horizon begins automatically duplicating all base DAO proposals within its own [metagovernance dashboard](https://eventhorizon.vote/vote).\n\n| **Step 2 – Metagovernance:** Retail voters may mint a free voter pass and begin voting to decide how the retail enfranchisement pool is mobilized in the base DAO proposal.\n\n| **Step 3 – Base DAO Voting:** 24 hours prior to the closure of the base DAO proposal, the Event Horizon metagovernance proposal closes. Event Horizon then automatically pushes the consensus decision established by the retail community during the metagovernance proposal into the base DAO proposal.\n\nThe end result is, **Citizens who vote through Event Horizon vote with a significant vote multiple**. We've often seen multiples upwards of 10,000x and roughly $40k voting power per voter. This provides new users a strong incentive to show up and vote.\n\n## Voter fatigue and self-selection\nImplicit Delegation has other elegant benefits. \n\nVoter fatigue is a well-known problem for delegates. It's a lot of work to carefully parse every new proposal, track the continuously evolving discussion, follow every iteration, and then express a well-written opinion on the matter when it comes time to vote. Add to the mix that many delegates are delegates on multiple DAOs and voter fatigue becomes quite understandable. \n\n*Given that Implicit Delegation's sole incentive is governance authority, it attracts people not interested in capital, but in governance*. So our model self-selects for governance nerds. \n\nBut there's an additional layer to this. Given the only incentive is governance authority, *Event Horizon voters only vote on what they have strong opinions on*. If there's a DeFi proposal, DeFi nerds come out of the woodwork. If there's a gaming proposal put up to Snapshot, then only the gaming nerds show up to vote. But the block is fully utilized every time. This ensures that we have 100% token participation every time, driven entirely by those underrepresented Citizens most interested in *this particular proposal*. This minimizes voter fatigue and rewards those who care most. \n",

Agents are free to create: https://EventHorizon.vote/proposals\n\n**Compound Partnership:** The Compound DAO delegated 50,000 COMP (~$2,500,000) to the Event Horizon Community.\n\n**Gitcoin Partnership:** Event Horizon officially partnered with Gitcoin to leverage the Gitcoin Passport and received a 150,000 GTC community delegation:\n\n [Announcement Tweet](https://x.com/EventHorizonDAO/status/1773075757759127818?s=20 )\n\n**Arbitrum Partnership:** Event Horizon also partnered with Arbitrum DAO and now facilitates a 7,000,000 ARB public voting pool for the community: https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegate/0x0edb976ce9b3b08c7e0a20a89bf1bce0e5f99356\n\n\n# More Information:\n**Most DAOs face a problem:** Not enough people care to vote, and those who do care don’t have much influence. Today, typical DAO voter and token participation hovers around 1%. That means 99% of a DAO's governance thought capital is not being used to improve the DAO's collective cognition. Voting when you only have, say, $100 worth of voting power, simply doesn’t make sense, it’s a drop in the bucket. Sitting out governance proposals is, unfortunately, the rational decision but collectively makes everyone worse off. However, given that the strength of the DAO is directly related to the number of participants having their voices heard by the community, this problem needs to be addressed.\n\n**Solution:** Voting is the first step to onboarding new DAO contributors and/or delegates. But without meaningful voting authority, new and existing DAO citizens will remain sidelined and the DAO will remain worse off compared to competitors who optimize top of funnel. \n\nEvent Horizon allows DAO citizens to vote with meaningful authority though is novel governance mechanism: [Implicit Delegation](https://medium.com/hvax/implicit-delegation-event-horizons-governance-solution-3815d61ded12) \n\nEvent Horizon slots into the broader DAO ecosystem in a similar fashion to a standard delegate. However, rather than the pool voting based on the decision of one individual or group, it votes with the collective cognition of hundreds of individual Event Horizon Voter Pass holders. This serves two functions:\n\n1. **Enfranchise Community Citizens:** It provides a clear and designated voice for smaller, retail voters.\n\n2. **Increase Meaningful Retail Participation:** It drives participation through a game theoretic process called Implicit Delegation. Whether 10 people show up to vote, or 10,000 people do, the full retail voter allotment is mobilized in support of the community’s desired outcome:\n\n*When participation is low…* each voter receives a larger slice of the public access pie. This means the fewer people there are voting, the more incentive there is for someone new to come and participate.\n\n*When participation is high…* there are more voters splitting the same pie, however, retail participation is high, which is a great win for the ecosystem.\n\nThis is all done without the need to pay delegates with inflationary token rewards, which would attract the wrong crowd anyway. Event Horizon’s model attracts people strictly interested in governance, not payment.\n\n**DAO Benefits:** From a DAO perspective, Implicit Delegation brings the many great ideas and voices from the long-tail distribution of low-capital community members to the surface. We like to say that the best ideas in an ecosystem are often held in the minds of individuals with $50 in governance voice, so we need a better platform for these ideas to be heard.\n\n\n**Delegate Benefits:** Governance is hard. It is nearly impossible to review, react to, and care about every individual proposal. EH functions as a hive mind to solve this problem. If there are 3 proposals (Gaming, Lending, and Partnership) 100 citizens may show up to vote for each, but the exact voter body may be entirely different each time, with those caring about gaming participating in the gaming proposal, and so on and so forth for the other proposal topics.\n\n# How it Works:\n\n| **Step 0 – Mint:** Any citizen of the DAO ecosystem may [mint](https://eventhorizon.vote/mint) a free voter pass.\n\n| **Step 1 – Duplication:** Once a delegation is established, Event Horizon begins automatically duplicating all base DAO proposals within its own [metagovernance dashboard](https://eventhorizon.vote/vote).\n\n| **Step 2 – Metagovernance:** Retail voters may mint a free voter pass and begin voting to decide how the retail enfranchisement pool is mobilized in the base DAO proposal.\n\n| **Step 3 – Base DAO Voting:** 24 hours prior to the closure of the base DAO proposal, the Event Horizon metagovernance proposal closes. Event Horizon then automatically pushes the consensus decision established by the retail community during the metagovernance proposal into the base DAO proposal.\n\nThe end result is, **Citizens who vote through Event Horizon vote with a significant vote multiple**. We've often seen multiples upwards of 10,000x and roughly $40k voting power per voter. This provides new users a strong incentive to show up and vote.\n\n## Voter fatigue and self-selection\nImplicit Delegation has other elegant benefits. \n\nVoter fatigue is a well-known problem for delegates. It's a lot of work to carefully parse every new proposal, track the continuously evolving discussion, follow every iteration, and then express a well-written opinion on the matter when it comes time to vote. Add to the mix that many delegates are delegates on multiple DAOs and voter fatigue becomes quite understandable. \n\n*Given that Implicit Delegation's sole incentive is governance authority, it attracts people not interested in capital, but in governance*. So our model self-selects for governance nerds. \n\nBut there's an additional layer to this. Given the only incentive is governance authority, *Event Horizon voters only vote on what they have strong opinions on*. If there's a DeFi proposal, DeFi nerds come out of the woodwork. If there's a gaming proposal put up to Snapshot, then only the gaming nerds show up to vote. But the block is fully utilized every time. This ensures that we have 100% token participation every time, driven entirely by those underrepresented Citizens most interested in *this particular proposal*. This minimizes voter fatigue and rewards those who care most. \n",
