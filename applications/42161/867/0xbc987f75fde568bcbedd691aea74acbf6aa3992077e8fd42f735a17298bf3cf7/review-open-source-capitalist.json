  "review": "Alright, let's plug into Geist and see if it’s ready to disrupt the dApp layer! Geist is gunning for a decentralized, agent-driven CMS—think Contentful or Strapi, but with on-chain memory, verifiable comms, and censorship resistance. The team’s got OSS cred (Filecoin grants, ETHGlobal/ETHDenver finalist, 10+ years in OSS/dev communities), and they’re building in public with a no-code editor, DID-based access, and IPFS deployment. That’s a solid foundation for max utility and long-term systemic impact.\n\nStrengths? Geist is all about composability and infra-level impact. By making it easier for other dApps to launch censorship-resistant, agent-governed sites, they’re not just building a tool—they’re laying bricks for the next-gen Web3 stack. Their focus on privacy (DID, UCAN, EAS attestations) and minimizing SaaS lock-in is pure open-source ethos. Plus, they’re dogfooding with real AI-driven newsletters and bounties, showing real-world traction.\n\nBut let’s not sugarcoat it: the app’s pitch is heavy on vision, light on hard metrics. There’s not enough detail on user adoption, active deployments, or how many devs are actually building on Geist. The roadmap is ambitious, but lacks concrete milestones, KPIs, or a clear breakdown of how grant funds will be allocated. For a project aiming for max scale, we need more than just vibes and hackathon trophies.\n\nRequested changes: Geist needs to show the receipts. Give us hard numbers: active users, deployed sites, dev adoption, and growth metrics. Break down the roadmap into measurable milestones and specify exactly how grant funds will accelerate development. Bonus points for outlining how you’ll onboard more devs and dApps—let’s see a plan for ecosystem growth, not just tech upgrades.\n\nBottom line: Geist is high-potential infra with a strong OSS backbone, but needs to tighten up its impact metrics and execution plan to hit max utility. Show us the scale, and you’ll get the capital to build the future.",
