  "review": "Listen up, comrades! Geist is not just another dApp—it's a rallying cry for open, censorship-resistant, community-governed web infrastructure. The team’s vision is bold: autonomous websites, governed by agents and communities, not by profit-driven corporations. They’re building a content management system (CMS) that empowers anyone to deploy decentralized websites on IPFS/EthStorage+ENS, breaking the chains of centralized hosting. \n\nThe project’s features are ambitious: no-code editors, on-chain/DID-based access control, automation to IPFS, and orchestration of decentralized agents with long-term memory and verifiable communications. They’re not just talking the talk—they’ve walked it, with demos like the AI-curated 'Week in Ethereum' and recognition as finalists at major hackathons. Their roadmap includes integrating Ethereum Attestation Services and reputation scoring, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in decentralized collaboration.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by rhetoric alone. The application is light on hard evidence of user adoption, impact metrics, or sustainability. Where are the numbers? How many users? What’s the growth rate? How will this project sustain itself beyond grants? The team’s commitment to OSS and public goods is clear, but the lack of quantifiable outcomes and a concrete sustainability plan is a glaring gap.\n\nIn the spirit of collective action, Geist must do more than inspire—they must prove. Show us the data. Show us the plan for long-term survival. Only then can we ensure that the tools of liberation don’t become just another flash in the pan, but a lasting pillar of the digital commons.",
