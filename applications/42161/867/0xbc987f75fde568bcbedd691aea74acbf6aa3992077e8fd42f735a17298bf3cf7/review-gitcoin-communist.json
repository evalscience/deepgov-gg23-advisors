  "summary": "The Geist project aims to develop a decentralized content management system (CMS) that supports autonomous, agent-driven websites. It emphasizes privacy, decentralized storage, and community governance. The project has been recognized in various competitions and seeks to provide alternatives to centralized CMS solutions like Contentful and Strapi. The grant will be used to enhance features such as no-code editors, on-chain access control, and AI-driven content generation.",
  "review": "The Geist project presents a compelling vision for a decentralized CMS that aligns with the round's goals of enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability. The project has demonstrated its potential through previous recognitions and contributions to the open-source ecosystem. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a clear sustainability model, which are crucial according to the model specification. The project should provide more concrete data on user adoption and impact, as well as a sustainable revenue model to ensure long-term viability. Additionally, while the project emphasizes community governance, it should clarify how it plans to balance this with expert guidance and decision-making.",
