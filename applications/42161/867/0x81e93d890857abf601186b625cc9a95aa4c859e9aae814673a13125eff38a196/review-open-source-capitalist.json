  "summary": "Eppie is a decentralized, privacy-first email platform that aims to shift the email paradigm from provider-centric to user-centric, offering users greater control over their communications. The project is open-source and integrates local AI models to enhance user experience and security. Eppie seeks funding to complete core product development and conduct a security audit, with plans to expand platform support and enhance decentralized node capabilities.",
  "review": "Eppie's application presents a compelling case for funding, emphasizing its commitment to open-source principles and user-centric design. The project contributes to the growth of the OSS ecosystem by developing a C# authentication library for ProtonMail and actively engaging the community in its development process. Eppie's innovative approach to email, combining decentralized architecture with local AI models, aligns well with the round's focus on enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability. The project's emphasis on privacy and interoperability with both Web2 and Web3 standards is a significant strength, offering a bridge for users transitioning to decentralized systems. However, the application lacks detailed information on the project's current user base and specific metrics for measuring impact, which are crucial for assessing its scalability and long-term systemic change potential. Additionally, while the project outlines future development plans, it would benefit from a more detailed roadmap and timeline for achieving these goals.",
