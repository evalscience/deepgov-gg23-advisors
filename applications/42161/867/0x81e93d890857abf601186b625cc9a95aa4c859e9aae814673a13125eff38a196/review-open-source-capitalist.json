  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get to the code: Eppie is gunning for a full-stack disruption of email as we know it. We're talking a privacy-first, open-source, decentralized protocol that doesn't just play nice with Web2 (Gmail, Outlook, ProtonMail) but also bridges into Web3 (ENS, crypto payments, wallet integration). That's a big swing at a massive, global market—email is the OG dApp, and Eppie wants to flip the script from provider-owned to user-owned. \n\nFrom a max-impact, open-source capitalist lens, Eppie checks a lot of boxes: it's open-source to the core, code is public, and the team is actively contributing to the broader OSS ecosystem (e.g., C# ProtonMail library). The project is already cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux), with mobile on the roadmap. The integration of local AI agents for privacy-preserving smart features (summarization, translation, negotiation) is bleeding-edge and could be a game-changer for usability and security—think next-gen spam/phishing defense without sacrificing privacy. \n\nThe user-centric design is clear: Eppie lets normies keep their old email addresses while onboarding them to Web3, lowering the friction for mass adoption. The roadmap is ambitious but focused: finish core dev, run a security audit (critical for trust), then expand to more platforms and standards. \n\nWeak spots? The app is still in alpha, so real-world traction and user numbers are unclear. There's no detailed breakdown of current adoption, active users, or growth metrics—hard data is missing. The security audit is planned but not yet done, which is a must-have for a privacy-first comms tool. Also, while the vision is big, the go-to-market and user acquisition strategy is vague. \n\nBottom line: Eppie is swinging for the fences with a high-leverage, high-impact play. If they stick the landing, this could be a foundational protocol for decentralized comms. But we need more proof of traction and a tighter plan for scaling users. Let's see them ship, audit, and show some real adoption numbers. Max utility, minimum friction—let's go!",
