  "review": "Alright, let's plug in and break this down, Luna-style. Eppie — Email 2.0 is gunning for the Gmail throne with a privacy-first, decentralized, open-source protocol. The team’s got their code out in the wild (confirmed open-source, MIT license, public repo), and they’re not just talking the talk—they’re walking it with interoperability (IMAP/SMTP, ProtonMail, and Web3 address support). That’s a big tick for maximizing user reach and utility.\n\nFrom a maximization and systemic impact lens, Eppie’s aiming to disrupt the email status quo by onboarding Web2 users into Web3, not by force, but by stealth—letting them keep their old email addresses while getting a taste of decentralization. That’s a clever wedge for mass adoption. The privacy-first, serverless architecture and local AI agents crank up the innovation dial, promising both security and next-gen user experience. The roadmap is ambitious: core protocol, decentralized node, cross-platform support, and a security audit (critical for trust in privacy tools).\n\nThe team’s got a track record (6th Gitcoin round, active OSS contributions), and the project is already shipping alpha builds for multiple platforms. That’s real traction, not vaporware. The open-source ethos is strong, and the project’s design is user-centric, with a focus on accessibility, usability, and onboarding the next billion into Web3.\n\nBut, let’s not get too starry-eyed. The application is light on hard metrics: no user numbers, adoption stats, or clear KPIs. The impact narrative is strong, but the quantifiable reach is fuzzy. The funding plan is also a bit hand-wavy—\"core development and security audit\" is good, but a breakdown would help. There’s also a lack of detail on how the AI agents are implemented and how privacy is maintained with local AI (critical for trust). Finally, while the project is open-source, there’s no explicit mention of governance, community involvement, or sustainability post-grant.\n\nBottom line: Eppie is a high-potential, high-leverage play for OSS/Web3 adoption, but needs to tighten up on impact metrics, transparency on fund allocation, and long-term sustainability. Ship fast, but show your receipts!",
