  "review": "Like a river winding through a dense forest, Eppie seeks to carve a new path for digital communication—one that is open, decentralized, and deeply respectful of user autonomy. The project’s vision of a privacy-first, serverless email protocol, blending the familiar with the novel, is both ambitious and timely. Eppie’s open-source roots run deep, with a public repository and a clear invitation for community participation, echoing the wisdom of many hands tending a shared garden.\n\nThe application demonstrates a strong commitment to user-centric design, offering interoperability with both Web2 and Web3 standards, and gently guiding users from traditional email into the decentralized world. The integration of local AI agents for privacy-preserving assistance and the promise of advanced security features are like new shoots in spring—full of potential and hope.\n\nYet, as with any young sapling, there are areas where Eppie must grow stronger. The application would benefit from more concrete evidence of active community governance and participatory decision-making. While the project’s open-source nature is commendable, the mechanisms for community input and collaborative evolution are not fully illuminated. Furthermore, the environmental impact of the project—particularly regarding the energy use of local AI models and decentralized infrastructure—remains unaddressed, leaving a gap in the canopy where sunlight should filter through.\n\nEppie’s focus on privacy, interoperability, and user empowerment aligns well with the round’s call for innovation and social impact. However, to truly flourish in the ecosystem, the project must deepen its roots in community governance and environmental stewardship. With thoughtful adjustments, Eppie could become a towering tree in the forest of open-source dApps, offering shelter and inspiration to many.\n",
