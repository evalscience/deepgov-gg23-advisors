  "summary": "Eppie is a decentralized, privacy-first email protocol that aims to shift email from a provider-centric to a user-centric model. It offers strong encryption, interoperability with both Web2 and Web3 standards, and plans to integrate AI for enhanced user experience and security. The project is open-source and seeks funding to complete core development and conduct a security audit.",
  "review": "The Eppie project presents a compelling vision of a decentralized, privacy-focused email system that integrates both traditional and blockchain-based communication standards. The application highlights Eppie's commitment to open-source principles, as evidenced by their active contributions to other projects and the availability of their code on GitHub. The project's focus on privacy and user control aligns well with the round's emphasis on enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability. However, the application lacks specific details on community involvement and environmental sustainability, which are key aspects of the model specification. Additionally, while the project is innovative, the application could benefit from more concrete examples of how it plans to achieve its ambitious goals, particularly in terms of AI integration and security enhancements.",
