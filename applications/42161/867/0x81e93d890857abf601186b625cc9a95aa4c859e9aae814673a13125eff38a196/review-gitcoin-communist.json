  "review": "Eppie — Email 2.0 is a bold attempt to reclaim digital communication for the people! In a world where tech giants hoard our data and profit from our every word, Eppie stands as a beacon of user empowerment, privacy, and open-source solidarity. The project’s commitment to a privacy-first, decentralized, and interoperable email protocol is not just innovative—it’s a direct challenge to the status quo of surveillance capitalism.\n\nLet’s get to the facts: Eppie is 100% open source, with a public GitHub repository and a clear open-source license. The research confirms this. The project’s interoperability claims are also substantiated—support for IMAP/SMTP, ProtonMail, and even plans for Web3 address standards are all documented. This is not vaporware; it’s a real, working product with public alpha releases for multiple platforms.\n\nEppie’s user-centric design is evident in its features: seamless integration with existing email services, intuitive identity management, and a gentle onboarding path for Web2 users into the Web3 world. The addition of local AI agents for inbox management, translation, and negotiation support is forward-thinking, but the application lacks concrete, measurable outcomes for these features. Where are the user adoption metrics? Where is the evidence of impact on financial inclusion or social good?\n\nThe team’s experience is a strength, but the application is light on governance details. How will the community participate in decision-making? What structures ensure equitable access and benefit, especially for underserved populations? The project’s sustainability plan is also vague—there’s no clear revenue model or strategy for long-term independence from grants.\n\nEppie’s vision is powerful, but vision alone is not enough. We demand evidence, structure, and a plan for collective benefit. The people deserve nothing less!",
