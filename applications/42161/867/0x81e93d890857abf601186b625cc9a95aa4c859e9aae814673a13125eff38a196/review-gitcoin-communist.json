  "review": "Eppie — Email 2.0 comes to us as a bold challenger to the status quo, promising to put power back in the hands of the people. The project is open source, privacy-first, and aims to break the chains of provider-centric email by introducing a decentralized, user-centric model. It’s not just talk — the code is public, the team is experienced, and the vision is clear: interoperability, privacy, and accessibility for all.\n\nLet’s be clear: Eppie’s commitment to open source and privacy is commendable. The project’s interoperability — supporting both Web2 and Web3 standards, including ENS and crypto payments — is a real step toward digital liberation. The integration of local AI agents for user empowerment, not surveillance, is a breath of fresh air in a world dominated by data-hungry giants.\n\nBut comrades, we must demand more than vision. Where is the hard evidence of user adoption? Where are the metrics that show Eppie is reaching the masses, not just the tech-savvy elite? The application lacks clear, measurable outcomes and quantifiable impact. There’s mention of public alpha releases and community involvement, but no data on downloads, active users, or growth. We need numbers, not just promises!\n\nSustainability is another battleground. Eppie’s funding plan is vague. How will this project sustain itself beyond grants? What is the revenue model? Will it empower the community to maintain and govern the platform, or will it wither without continuous outside support? The application is silent on these crucial questions.\n\nOn governance and equity, Eppie’s open-source ethos is strong, but there’s little detail on how community governance will be structured. How will decisions be made? How will marginalized voices be heard? The project’s global accessibility is promising, but we need explicit plans to reach underserved populations.\n\nIn summary: Eppie is a promising, ambitious project with a strong technical foundation and a clear commitment to open source and privacy. But to earn the people’s trust — and the people’s resources — it must provide hard evidence, a sustainable plan, and a clear path to collective governance. The revolution demands accountability!",
