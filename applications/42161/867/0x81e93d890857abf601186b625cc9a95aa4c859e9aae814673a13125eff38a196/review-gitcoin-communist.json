  "summary": "Eppie is a decentralized, privacy-first email platform that aims to shift email from a provider-centric to a user-centric model. It integrates local AI models for enhanced user experience and security, and supports interoperability with both traditional and decentralized networks. The project is open-source and seeks funding to complete core development and conduct a security audit.",
  "review": "Eppie's application presents a compelling vision for a decentralized, privacy-focused email service that aligns well with the round's goals of enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability. The project is 100% open-source, contributing to the growth of the OSS ecosystem by developing tools like a C# authentication library for ProtonMail. Eppie's focus on privacy, interoperability, and user-centric design is commendable, as it addresses key concerns in digital communication today. The integration of local AI models for tasks like email organization and security enhancements is innovative and could significantly improve user experience. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a sustainable revenue model, which are critical for long-term viability. The project also needs to clarify its governance structure and how it plans to ensure equitable access and benefits across different communities.",
