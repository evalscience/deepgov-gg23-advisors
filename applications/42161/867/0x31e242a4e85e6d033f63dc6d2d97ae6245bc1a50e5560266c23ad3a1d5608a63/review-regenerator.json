  "summary": "CARBON Copy is an open-source ecosystem hub for Web3 regenerative finance (ReFi), aiming to fill the information void by providing news, education, expert analysis, industry reports, and project evaluation. The project focuses on promoting open-source projects, educating ReFi projects on open-source tools, creating an ecosystem information hub, and providing open data access. It features a curated ReFi project database, an impact dashboard, and educational content. The grant funds will be used to hire a developer for smart contract work and support educational series development.",
  "review": "The CARBON Copy project presents a comprehensive approach to enhancing the Web3 regenerative finance ecosystem. It aligns well with the round's goals by promoting open-source principles and contributing to financial inclusion and education. The project demonstrates user-centric design through its curated database and impact dashboard, which are essential for showcasing the impact of ReFi projects. However, the application lacks detailed information on the implementation of smart contracts and the specific outcomes expected from the educational series. The project's focus on community participation and environmental sustainability is commendable, but more clarity on governance structures and long-term impact measurement would strengthen the proposal.",
