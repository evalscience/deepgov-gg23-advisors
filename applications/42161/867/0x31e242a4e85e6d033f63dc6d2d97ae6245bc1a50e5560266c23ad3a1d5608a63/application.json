          "answer": "### 1) Promoting other open-source projects\n\nReFi is full of open-source projects trying to facilitate funding for grassroots ecological and social impact. We are keenly aware that open-source software stands a much better chance of impacting people's lives on the ground than its closed-source counterpart. For one, open-source allows for horizontal scale. Other localities can fork the software and tailor for their own needs without having to worry about having too little profit potential for closed-source alternatives.\n\nAs such, we shed light on the impact these open-source projects are making. Regen Network, Open Forest Protocol, GoodDollar, Glo Dollar, and M3tering Protocol, to name some examples. \n\n### 2) Educating ReFi/regen projects on how to use open-source tools\n\nAlthough the educational series is not yet launched, we are firmly committed to helping builders maximise the use of open-source tools in their solutions. Given funding constraints and the unique needs of ReFi projects, open-source tools are the only viable option. But this means significant work needs to surface the right tools and help builders to leverage them. Our partnership with GreenPill Writers Guild is designed to do just that as part of the larger Local ReFi Toolkit driven by Regen Coordination.\n\n### 3) A blueprint for an ecosystem information hub\n\nCARBON Copy can be easily forked by any project that wants to start mapping/covering an ecosystem. We think this is a great way to shed light on niche ecosystems. DeSci, for example, would benefit from such a hub.\n\nThe next major part of this is adding a way to decentralize management of the hub so that it can be community run. We've already put together the [first draft](https://github.com/carboncopyrefi/carbon-copy-site/wiki/Ecosystem-Management-Tool-Specs) of the specs for your perusal.\n\n### 4) Open data\n\nAccess to our ReFi data API is available upon request. We are working to make it publicly available this year.",

          "type": "paragraph",
          "answer": "### 1) Curated ReFi Project database\n\nA curated list of all projects in and tangential to the ReFi space. Each project has its own profile page, while each category also has its own dedicated page.\n\nThe database also manifests as a landscape diagram that maps out the space into various categories.\n\n### 2) ReFi Impact Dashboard\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for ReFi projects is demonstrating impact. This is partly because projects are small and don't, by themselves, represent significant impact. But it's also due to not having an aggregator like DeFi Llama or Growthepie.xyz.\n\nWe've set out to fill this void by designing a simple dashboard that displays aggregated impact data across key impact metrics. It's currently in early beta, but we hope to improve it \n\n### 3) Other ReFi ecosystem data\n\nWe also track builders, opportunities, knowledge, news, media coverage, fundraising, and tokens to provide a well-rounded view of the space.\n\n### 4) Education\n\nMuch of our content is designed to educate readers about ReFi and the work being done in the space. \n\nWe've also developed a [Web3 fundraising guide](https://carboncopy.news/guides/web3-grant-fundraising-guide-ngo/) specifically for Nigeria that has since served as the foundation for The ReFi Club - a 150-strong community of aspiring regens in the country.\n\nWe are looking to expand our educational offering through a partnership with GreenPill Writers Guild (more details in the next question).\n\n### Differentiation\n\nWe are the only comprehensive information source for the ReFi space. In other words, a combination of CoinDesk, Crunchbase, and DeFi Llama but for Web3-powered ecological and social impact.\n\nWe're also the only project looking to aggregate the impact being made by the entire ecosystem as a means to build its stature in the eyes of the larger Web3 industry and climate/development finance.\n",

          "type": "paragraph",
          "answer": "### 1) Integrate impact data from more projects \n\nWe've currently integrated just over 20 projects but would like to integrate 20-30 more to make our aggregate metrics more indicative of the work being done in the space.\n\nThe primary benefit of integrating data from more projects is that our dashboard becomes more comprehensive.\n\n### 2) Launch v1 of the ReFi Impact Dashboard\n\nAside from integrating more data, the dashboard needs more interactivity. Users need to be able to drill down into metrics to see project-specific data, changes over time, and sub-categorization (e.g., ecological credit types).\n\nIn addition, we also want to capture data from new impact reporting frameworks. As Regen Coordination's efforts to integrate its CIDS impact reporting framework into Karma GAP begin to bear fruit, it's important that we include this data in our dashboard.\n\n### 3) Publish educational content series by GreenPill Writers Guild\n\nA series of research-based articles to explore a key question: how much are ReFi communities using Web3 tools, and how are those tools affecting their work?\n\nWhen tech is difficult to use or has a steep learning curve, projects default to using tools they are familiar with. Despite the promise of using Web3 tools for decentralization, many ReFi projects still rely on familiar, centralized tools like Google Sheets and common messaging apps. By identifying pain points and surfacing real-world experiences, we can support better tooling decisions.\n\nDeliverables:\n\n- A long-form educational report featuring case studies, real-world use cases, an overview of the pros and cons of commonly used Web3 tools, and actionable recommendations linked to the Local ReFi Toolkit.\n\n- A set of survey tools and datasets for reuse in future work\n\n- Summaries and explainer pieces for social media distribution\n\n### 4) Continue work on ecosystem management tool\n\nAs per our stated milestone on [Karma GAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/carbon-copy-1/funding/0xbf279cdb15ce4eb6397ae7ac3011592a86a1f95e08e4e157287299ed81a0f45a/milestones-and-updates) after the GG22 dApps and Apps round, we have completed the [first draft](https://github.com/carboncopyrefi/carbon-copy-site/wiki/Ecosystem-Management-Tool-Specs) of the specs for the additions we need to make to CARBON Copy. The next step is to hire a smart contract developer that can develop the necessary smart contracts.\n\n## How will the funds be used?\n\n### 1) Hire a developer\n\nWe're hoping to raise enough to cover the cost of the smart contract work and, provided we find a developer who also has JS and Python experience, integration/dashboard work.\n\n### 2) Support the writing, research, coordination, and content design of the educational series\n",
