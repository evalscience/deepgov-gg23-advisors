  "summary": "Wrap on Privacy is a privacy-focused dApp that allows users to conduct private transactions on EVM chains. It offers unique features such as user-controlled privacy pools, encrypted balances, and integration with Aave aTokens. The project aims to enhance the OSS ecosystem by providing a more flexible and user-friendly privacy tool compared to existing solutions like Railgun and Tornado Cash. The grant funds are intended for user validation controls, testing, and audits.",
  "review": "The Wrap on Privacy project presents a compelling case for enhancing privacy in the Web3 ecosystem. It differentiates itself from existing solutions by allowing users to control their privacy pools and set their own fees, which could potentially democratize privacy tools. The project's focus on encrypted balances instead of UTXO models is a significant innovation, making it more efficient for mobile users. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a sustainable revenue model, which are critical for long-term success. The project also needs to clarify its governance structure and how it plans to ensure equitable access and benefits across different communities.",
