  "review": "The Noblocks project presents a compelling case for funding within the GG23 OSS - dApps and Apps round. It demonstrates a strong commitment to open-source principles and aims to enhance financial inclusion by providing a decentralized off-ramp solution for users in the global south. The project's innovative approach, using a decentralized pool of funds, aligns well with the round's emphasis on novel utilities and services. Additionally, the planned release of the Stablecoin-rates UI project indicates a forward-thinking approach to ecosystem growth. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on user-centric design and specific measurable outcomes to better align with the round's requirements.",
