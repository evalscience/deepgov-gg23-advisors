  "summary": "The Noblocks project is a decentralized application (dApp) focused on providing a seamless crypto-to-fiat conversion service, particularly targeting users in the global south. The project is open-source and aims to enhance the open-source software (OSS) ecosystem by decentralizing the pool of funds used for off-ramping, which is supplied by various independent fiat liquidity providers. The project also plans to release a sister project, Stablecoin-rates UI, to aggregate stablecoin exchange rates from different exchanges. The grant application highlights the project's contribution to financial inclusion and its innovative approach to decentralizing fiat liquidity.",
  "review": "The Noblocks project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's focus on open-source dApps and apps that enhance Web3 accessibility and usability. The project's emphasis on decentralizing fiat liquidity and targeting underserved regions in the global south is commendable and aligns with the principles of geographic equity and collective benefit. However, the application lacks detailed information on measurable outcomes and a sustainable revenue model, which are critical for long-term viability and alignment with the sustainability principles outlined in the model specification. Additionally, while the project is innovative, it would benefit from more rigorous evaluation methods and transparent reporting of outcomes to strengthen its case for funding.",
