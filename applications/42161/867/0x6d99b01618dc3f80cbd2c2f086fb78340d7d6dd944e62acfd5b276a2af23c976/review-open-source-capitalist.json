  "summary": "Noblocks is an open-source dApp designed to facilitate seamless crypto-to-fiat conversion, particularly targeting users in the global south. The project stands out by utilizing a decentralized pool of funds provided by various fiat liquidity providers, enhancing its resilience and scalability. The team plans to further develop the project by releasing a sister project, Stablecoin-rates UI, which aggregates stablecoin exchange rates from different exchanges. The grant funds will be used to support these development efforts.",
  "review": "The Noblocks project presents a compelling case for funding due to its focus on financial inclusion and its innovative approach to crypto-to-fiat conversion. The use of a decentralized pool of funds for off-ramping is a significant differentiator, aligning with the round's emphasis on novel utilities and services. The project contributes to the growth of the OSS ecosystem by being fully open-source and engaging developers worldwide. However, the application lacks detailed information on user-centric design and specific metrics for measuring impact, which are crucial for assessing its potential scalability and effectiveness. Additionally, while the project mentions plans for further development, it does not provide a detailed roadmap or budget allocation for the grant funds, which is necessary for evaluating the feasibility and sustainability of the proposed developments.",
