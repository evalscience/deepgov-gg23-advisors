  "review": "Alright, let’s cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. RemusDEX is gunning for a big slice of the DeFi pie by launching the first fully on-chain CLOB DEX on Starknet, with a laser focus on onboarding Bitcoin liquidity (including Runes) into the DeFi ecosystem. That’s a massive, untapped market—think $2T+ in potential capital. The project is open-source, audited, and already live on mainnet, which is a huge plus for transparency and trust. \n\nFrom a maximization and impact lens, RemusDEX is swinging for the fences: permissionless market creation, composability, and integration with other DeFi protocols. The roadmap is ambitious but clear—1,000 weekly active users, $5M daily volume, and expansion of trading pairs. The team’s got their eyes on the prize: scale, scale, scale. \n\nInnovation? Check. They’re ditching the AMM model for a CLOB, which means no more slippage or impermanent loss headaches. Plus, they’re the first to bring Bitcoin Runes trading to Starknet. That’s a serious differentiator. \n\nBut let’s not get too starry-eyed. The app’s user-centric design is mentioned, but there’s not enough detail on how user feedback is systematically gathered and implemented. Also, while the project claims open-source cred, there’s no direct link to the audit report or a breakdown of how the codebase is governed. And while the goals are bold, there’s no granular breakdown of how grant funds will be allocated—just high-level targets. \n\nBottom line: RemusDEX is a high-impact, high-potential project that aligns with the round’s goals and the Open Source Capitalist’s constitutional principles. But to really max out on trust and efficiency, they need to show more receipts—detailed fund allocation, user feedback mechanisms, and direct links to audits and governance processes. \n\nCitations: \n- Round requirements: user-centric design, open-source, innovation, ecosystem growth\n- Model spec: prioritize scale, innovation, and long-term systemic impact over distributional equity or process overhead\n- Application: mainnet launch, open-source, CLOB innovation, Bitcoin integration, ambitious growth targets",
