  "summary": "RemusDEX is a fully on-chain, permissionless Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) DEX on Starknet, aiming to integrate Bitcoin liquidity into DeFi. The project emphasizes open-source principles, transparency, and community collaboration. It offers unique features like precise limit orders, deep liquidity, and spot leverage, differentiating it from traditional AMMs. The grant funds will be used to enhance UX/UI, expand trading pairs, and onboard high-volume traders, with specific goals of achieving 1,000 weekly active users and $5 million in daily trading volume.",
  "review": "The RemusDEX project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's focus on open-source dApps and apps that enhance Web3 accessibility and usability. The project demonstrates a strong commitment to open-source principles, with transparent smart contracts and community collaboration. Its innovative approach to integrating Bitcoin liquidity into DeFi through Starknet is noteworthy, offering potential for significant ecosystem growth. The project's focus on user-centric design, as evidenced by continuous UX/UI refinement and strategic onboarding campaigns, aligns with the round's requirements. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on how the project plans to achieve its ambitious user and volume targets, as well as a clearer explanation of the project's long-term sustainability and impact.",
