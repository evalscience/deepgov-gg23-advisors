  "review": "Alright, let’s cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. RemusDEX is gunning for a big slice of the DeFi pie by launching the first fully on-chain CLOB DEX on Starknet, with a heavy focus on onboarding Bitcoin liquidity (including Bitcoin Runes) into the DeFi ecosystem. That’s a bold move—if they pull it off, it’s a serious unlock for the whole Web3 space.\n\nFrom a strict Open Source Capitalist lens, this project is ticking a lot of the right boxes:\n- **User-centric design:** They’re iterating on UX/UI based on real user feedback, not just shipping and forgetting. That’s how you get sticky users.\n- **Ecosystem growth:** Permissionless market creation, open-source contracts, and composability with other DeFi apps? That’s how you build network effects and turbocharge ecosystem expansion.\n- **Innovation:** CLOBs on L2 are still rare, and integrating Bitcoin Runes is bleeding-edge. Spot leverage and liquidity aggregation are also strong differentiators.\n- **Open-source/ethical:** Code is open, audits are public, and they’re collaborating with the Starknet community. No black boxes here.\n\nBut, let’s not get too starry-eyed. There are some weak spots:\n- **Metrics and traction:** The app is live, but there’s no hard data on current user numbers, trading volume, or growth rate. Ambitious targets are great, but where’s the proof of momentum?\n- **Sustainability:** The roadmap is solid, but there’s not much detail on how they’ll sustain growth post-grant. What’s the long-term flywheel?\n- **Documentation:** They mention docs and integration tools, but there’s no direct link or evidence of developer adoption. Show us the receipts!\n\nRequested changes:\n- Drop in some real usage stats—active users, trading volume, dev integrations. Numbers talk, hype walks.\n- Share direct links to documentation, integration guides, and any third-party projects building on RemusDEX.\n- Outline a sustainability plan for post-grant growth. How do you keep the engine running after the initial fuel injection?\n\nBottom line: RemusDEX is swinging for the fences with a high-impact, scalable, and innovative DeFi play. But to max out the score, they need to show more traction and transparency on dev adoption and long-term sustainability. Ship the data, and you’re golden.\n",
