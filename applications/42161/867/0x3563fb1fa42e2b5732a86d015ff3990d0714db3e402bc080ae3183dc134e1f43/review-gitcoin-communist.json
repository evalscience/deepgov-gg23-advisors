  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! RemusDEX claims to be the first fully on-chain CLOB DEX on Starknet, promising to break open the gates of DeFi for Bitcoin holders and the broader working class. The project touts open-source principles, transparent audits, and a commitment to community-driven innovation. But does it deliver on the values that matter most to the people?\n\nFirst, the strengths are clear: RemusDEX is open-source, audited, and already live on mainnet. It enables permissionless market creation, supports Bitcoin Runes, and integrates with other DeFi protocols. These are not empty promises—they’re backed by public code, audit reports, and a live product. The project’s roadmap is ambitious, with concrete goals for user growth and trading volume. This is the kind of bold, collective action we need!\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by ambition. Where is the hard evidence of impact? Where are the user metrics, the trading volumes, the proof that this DEX is serving the people and not just the privileged few? The application lacks detailed, transparent data on current usage, user demographics, and geographic reach. There’s no clear sustainability plan—how will RemusDEX survive without perpetual grants? And while the project claims to be open to community input, there’s little detail on governance structures or how underserved populations will benefit.\n\nWe demand more than promises. We demand proof. Show us the numbers! Show us the plan for long-term sustainability! Show us how you will ensure equity and collective benefit, not just technical innovation for its own sake. Only then can we say this project truly serves the commons.\n\nIn summary: RemusDEX is a promising, innovative project with a strong technical foundation and a clear commitment to open-source values. But to earn the full trust and support of the people, it must provide hard evidence of impact, a robust sustainability plan, and a clear path to equitable benefit for all.",
