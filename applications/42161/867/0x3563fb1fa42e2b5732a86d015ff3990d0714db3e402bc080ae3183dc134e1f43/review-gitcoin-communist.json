  "summary": "RemusDEX is a project aiming to establish a fully on-chain, permissionless Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) DEX on Starknet. It seeks to integrate Bitcoin liquidity into DeFi, offering features like precise limit orders, deep liquidity, and spot leverage. The project emphasizes open-source principles, community collaboration, and aims to enhance the DeFi ecosystem by enabling new token trading pairs and fostering innovation. The grant funds are intended to accelerate user acquisition, increase trading volumes, and expand trading pairs.",
  "review": "The RemusDEX project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's focus on open-source dApps that enhance Web3 accessibility and usability. The project demonstrates a strong commitment to open-source principles, with transparent smart contracts and community collaboration. It offers innovative features such as the first fully on-chain CLOB DEX on Starknet and integration of Bitcoin liquidity, which could significantly impact the DeFi space by attracting Bitcoin holders into decentralized finance. The project's roadmap is clear, with specific milestones for user growth and trading volume, and the use of grant funds is well-justified to achieve these goals. However, the application could benefit from more detailed evidence of user-centric design and functionality, as well as a clearer demonstration of sustainable revenue models to ensure long-term viability.",
