  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the code: Geodework is gunning for the geographic decentralization of Ethereum, spinning out from the Ethereum Foundation to build infra, fund grassroots orgs, and push OSS ecodev globally. The pitch is all about making Ethereum more robust by spreading out its nodes, devs, and community—think anti-fragility at scale. They’ve got receipts: helped launch orgs like 0xPARC and BuidlGuidl, supported university groups worldwide, and executed 100+ geo grants. Their roadmap? Keep building community infra (like Local Ethereum, Ethereum Job Board), facilitate grants, and double down on public goods for the global Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nFrom a maximization lens, this project is swinging for the fences: it’s not just about one region or a niche dApp, but about making the whole Ethereum network more resilient and accessible. That’s a big win for total impact. The focus on infra and education means the benefits can scale—if they execute. The open-source ethos is strong, and their track record with the EF gives them credibility. But, let’s not get lost in the hype: the app’s actual user-centric design and concrete dApp features are under-detailed. There’s a lot of talk about infra and grants, but not enough specifics on what’s being built, how it’s novel, or how users interact with it. The differentiation is mostly at the org level, not the product level.\n\nFor a round focused on dApps and apps, I want to see more code, less manifesto. Where’s the open repo for Local Ethereum? What’s the UX? How are users onboarded? What’s the killer feature? The application needs to get granular—show me the product, not just the philosophy. Also, the use of funds is vague: “community infra work and ecodev operational costs” is too broad. Break it down: what’s the burn rate, what milestones are you hitting, and how does each dollar drive OSS adoption?\n\nIn summary: Geodework is a high-potential, high-impact play with a proven team and a mission that aligns with OSS maximization. But to unlock max utility, they need to ship more details, show real user flows, and get specific about deliverables. Less talk, more build. That’s how you disrupt the system.",
