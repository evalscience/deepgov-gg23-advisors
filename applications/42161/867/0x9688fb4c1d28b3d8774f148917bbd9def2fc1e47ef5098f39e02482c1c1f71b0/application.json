          "answer": "Geodework's North Star is the geographic decentralization of Ethereum, which is arguably the most interesting OSS project the world has ever seen. \n\nEthereum is a global network that comes into form as a result of geographically distributed “local nodes” (technical, social, organizational). Ethereum is deeply rooted in geography. As a case-in-point, imagine that 100% of validator nodes or 100% of Ethereum devs were located in one region. Here, the role of physical geography in Ethereum becomes instantly clear: it’s existential to the censorship resistance of the open-source network that is Ethereum. And thus, Ethereum needs people whose job it is to think about and work towards the geographic decentralization of strategic ecosystem variables. But crucially, we also need people to “do” and do with an emphasis on urgency, clean, crisp execution, and excellence. \n\n\nAnd so at a high-level, Geodework does Ethereum/L1 ecosystem development with a focus on the geographic decentralization of Ethereum, and therefore contributes to the growth of the OSS ecosystem.  In practice, this means we build ecosystem products and we source, curate, support, and fund builders and organizations contributing to the OSS ecosystem. While operating as an internal team at the EF, we: \n\n* Helped facilitate the creation of OSS-minded orgs such as The Red Guild, 0xPARC, BuidlGuidl, ETHKipu\n\n* Built up education ecodev efforts by supporting professors and student groups at universities around the world such as TUM, Princeton, KTH, UTokyo, BITS Pilani.\n\n* Sourced and executed 100+ geo grants,  many OSS-related, reaching communities like ETHTaipei, EthereumTGU, ETHKL, SpaghettiETH, ETHCluj, Ethereum Argentina, and many others.\n\n\nAll of which contribute to the OSS ecosystem, through the education, content, applications, and tools created as a result. \n\nGeodework continues to do similar work, e.g.,\n\n* Building educational and community infra products and tools, e.g., ([Local Ethereum](https://localethereum.beehiiv.com/), Ethereum Job Board, and more to come)\n* Facilitating Ethereum-focused grant giving\n* And executing on public goods work of global Ethereum ecosystem development\n",

        "description": "## Who?\n\n[Geodework](https://geodework.com/) is a spin-out organization of the Ethereum Foundation dedicated to global Ethereum ecosystem development.\n\nPrior to spinning out, we at Geodework were an internal EF team called Generalist Ecodev. As its name suggests, Generalist Ecodev served a “general” ecodev function. Which means, we did Ethereum ecodev with a broad, general mandate in mind and thought about Ethereum ecodev as an object in its own right. \n\nFor instance, just as protocol development is an object that consists of technical work streams like “scaling research” or “client development”, ecosystem development is an object that consists of work streams largely having to do with community infrastructure: “org building,” “developer growth,” “education or regional ecodev,” etc, etc. And within this frame, Generalist Ecodev accomplished a lot. We: \n\n* Helped facilitate the creation of orgs such as The Red Guild, 0xPARC, BuidlGuidl, ETHKipu \n* Built up education ecodev efforts by supporting professors and student groups at universities around the world such as TUM, Princeton, KTH, UTokyo, BITS Pilani. \n* Sourced and executed 100+ geo grants, reaching communities like ETHTaipei, EthereumTGU, ETHKL, SpaghettiETH, ETHCluj, Ethereum Argentina, and many others. \n* Among other wins \n\nOver time, Generalist Ecodev came to focus more and more on the “regional or grassroots development” (“geo ecodev”) stream because of its importance: Ethereum is a global network that comes into form as a result of geographically distributed “local nodes” (technical, social, organizational). Ethereum is deeply rooted in geography. As a case-in-point, imagine that 100% of validator nodes or 100% of Ethereum devs were located in one region. Here, the role of physical geography in Ethereum becomes instantly clear: it’s existential to the censorship resistance of the network. \n\nAnd so Ethereum needs people whose job it is to think about and work towards the geographic decentralization of strategic ecosystem variables. But crucially, we also need people to “do” and do with an emphasis on urgency, clean, crisp execution, and excellence. \n\nGeneralist Ecodev, now Geodework, has been one such example of a group of people. \n\n\n## What?\n\nGeodework will pursue the geographic decentralization of Ethereum in a similar vein as our EF team had done. We will continue to source and support talented grassroots contributors and facilitate grants. And we’ll continue to do our brand of execution-oriented geo ecodev.\n\nConcretely, Geodework is an ecosystem product studio dedicated to global Ethereum ecosystem development and as such building a better Internet. Which means we will:\n\n* Build educational and community infra products and tools, e.g., (Local Ethereum, Ethereum Job Board, and more to come)\n* Facilitate Ethereum-focused grant giving\n* And execute on public goods work of global Ethereum ecosystem development\n\n## Why?\n\nGeodework spun out of the Ethereum Foundation because there are virtually no organizations within the Ethereum ecosystem, outside the EF, that treat Ethereum ecodev as a first class citizen and execute towards a mandate of global Ethereum ecosystem development — much less geo ecodev. And we think that needs to change. \n\nEthereum requires and deserves a multitude of competent Ethereum-first orgs that come with their own unique perspectives and approaches to solving problems. \n\nJust as the space values core protocol development and client diversity, we believe it needs to come to equally value core ecosystem development and community infra diversity. And just as Ethereum is more robust with multiple client teams, Ethereum will be more robust with multiple community infra teams. \n\n## Where?\n\nWorldwide \n\n\n## How?\n\nWe will execute primarily by:\n\n* Building out educational and community infra products and tools\n* Facilitating grant-giving \n* And execute on public goods work of global Ethereum ecosystem development\n\n## When?\n\nNow. \n\nEthereum must win now.",

      "description": "## Who?\n\n[Geodework](https://geodework.com/) is a spin-out organization of the Ethereum Foundation dedicated to global Ethereum ecosystem development.\n\nPrior to spinning out, we at Geodework were an internal EF team called Generalist Ecodev. As its name suggests, Generalist Ecodev served a “general” ecodev function. Which means, we did Ethereum ecodev with a broad, general mandate in mind and thought about Ethereum ecodev as an object in its own right. \n\nFor instance, just as protocol development is an object that consists of technical work streams like “scaling research” or “client development”, ecosystem development is an object that consists of work streams largely having to do with community infrastructure: “org building,” “developer growth,” “education or regional ecodev,” etc, etc. And within this frame, Generalist Ecodev accomplished a lot. We: \n\n* Helped facilitate the creation of orgs such as The Red Guild, 0xPARC, BuidlGuidl, ETHKipu \n* Built up education ecodev efforts by supporting professors and student groups at universities around the world such as TUM, Princeton, KTH, UTokyo, BITS Pilani. \n* Sourced and executed 100+ geo grants, reaching communities like ETHTaipei, EthereumTGU, ETHKL, SpaghettiETH, ETHCluj, Ethereum Argentina, and many others. \n* Among other wins \n\nOver time, Generalist Ecodev came to focus more and more on the “regional or grassroots development” (“geo ecodev”) stream because of its importance: Ethereum is a global network that comes into form as a result of geographically distributed “local nodes” (technical, social, organizational). Ethereum is deeply rooted in geography. As a case-in-point, imagine that 100% of validator nodes or 100% of Ethereum devs were located in one region. Here, the role of physical geography in Ethereum becomes instantly clear: it’s existential to the censorship resistance of the network. \n\nAnd so Ethereum needs people whose job it is to think about and work towards the geographic decentralization of strategic ecosystem variables. But crucially, we also need people to “do” and do with an emphasis on urgency, clean, crisp execution, and excellence. \n\nGeneralist Ecodev, now Geodework, has been one such example of a group of people. \n\n\n## What?\n\nGeodework will pursue the geographic decentralization of Ethereum in a similar vein as our EF team had done. We will continue to source and support talented grassroots contributors and facilitate grants. And we’ll continue to do our brand of execution-oriented geo ecodev.\n\nConcretely, Geodework is an ecosystem product studio dedicated to global Ethereum ecosystem development and as such building a better Internet. Which means we will:\n\n* Build educational and community infra products and tools, e.g., ([Local Ethereum](https://localethereum.beehiiv.com/), Ethereum Job Board, and more to come)\n* Facilitate Ethereum-focused grant giving\n* And execute on public goods work of global Ethereum ecosystem development\n\n## Why?\n\nGeodework spun out of the Ethereum Foundation because there are virtually no organizations within the Ethereum ecosystem, outside the EF, that treat Ethereum ecodev as a first class citizen and execute towards a mandate of global Ethereum ecosystem development — much less geo ecodev. And we think that needs to change. \n\nEthereum requires and deserves a multitude of competent Ethereum-first orgs that come with their own unique perspectives and approaches to solving problems. \n\nJust as the space values core protocol development and client diversity, we believe it needs to come to equally value core ecosystem development and community infra diversity. And just as Ethereum is more robust with multiple client teams, Ethereum will be more robust with multiple community infra teams. \n\n## Where?\n\nWorldwide \n\n\n## How?\n\nWe will execute primarily by:\n\n* Building out educational and community infra products and tools\n* Facilitating grant-giving \n* And execute on public goods work of global Ethereum ecosystem development\n\n## When?\n\nNow. \n\nEthereum must win now.",
