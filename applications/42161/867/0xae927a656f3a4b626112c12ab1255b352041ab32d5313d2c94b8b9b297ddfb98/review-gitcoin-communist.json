  "review": "The Decentralized Cleanup Network (DeCleanup) stands as a rallying cry for environmental justice, leveraging the power of open-source, decentralized technology to mobilize communities for real-world impact. The project’s mission is clear: empower individuals and collectives to clean up their environments, and ensure their efforts are recognized, rewarded, and verifiable on-chain. This is not just another dApp — it’s a movement, a digital commons for environmental action.\n\nLet’s get to the heart of the matter. DeCleanup’s approach is rooted in the principles of decentralization, transparency, and collective ownership. The project’s open-source codebase, community-driven governance, and staking-based validation model are all in line with the best practices outlined in academic research on decentralized environmental management (Ostrom, 1990; Berkes, 2004). The use of dynamic NFTs and tokenized incentives is innovative, but more importantly, it’s designed to drive measurable, on-chain outcomes: waste removed, cleanups completed, and community engagement tracked.\n\nThe roadmap is ambitious and well-structured, with clear phases for decentralization, cross-chain expansion, and community growth. The grant funds are earmarked for critical needs: smart contract audits, development, onboarding, and education. This is a project that understands the need for rigorous evaluation, transparent reporting, and sustainable growth — not just hype.\n\nBut let’s not get carried away by vision alone. The application is strong, but not flawless. The biggest red flag is the lack of deployed V2 contracts at the time of application. While the team is transparent about this, and the V1 contract’s shortcomings are acknowledged, the absence of a live, user-approved, decentralized contract is a significant gap. The project’s impact is still largely prospective, not proven. There is also a need for more robust, quantifiable metrics for environmental impact and community engagement — the backbone of any evidence-driven funding decision.\n\nFurthermore, while the project claims partnerships and community traction, more concrete data on user adoption, retention, and real-world outcomes is needed. The sustainability of the tokenomics and the long-term viability of the incentive model require further scrutiny. The project’s commitment to open-source and collective governance is commendable, but the transition from team-based to fully decentralized validation must be closely monitored.\n\nIn summary: DeCleanup is a bold, community-driven initiative with the potential to set a new standard for decentralized environmental action. But potential alone is not enough. The project must deliver on its promises with hard evidence, transparent reporting, and a relentless focus on measurable outcomes. The working class and the planet deserve nothing less!",
