  "summary": "The Decentralized Cleanup Network is an innovative project that leverages Web3 technology to incentivize environmental cleanups through a decentralized, gamified model. It aims to tokenize real-world environmental efforts, creating a cycle of positive impact and rewards. The project is still in development, with plans to expand its network, enhance its reward model, and transition to full decentralization. The grant funds will be used for smart contract audits, development, onboarding incentives, community growth, and education.",
  "review": "The Decentralized Cleanup Network presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's focus on open-source dApps and apps that enhance Web3 accessibility and usability. The project contributes to the Web3 ecosystem by introducing a novel use case that combines environmental impact with decentralized incentives. It demonstrates user-centric design through its gamified approach and plans for a decentralized governance model. However, the project is still in development, with key components like smart contracts not yet deployed, which poses a risk to its timely execution. The project's roadmap is ambitious, aiming for full decentralization and cross-chain expansion, which aligns with the long-term systemic change and innovation principles outlined in the model specification. The use of grant funds is well-justified, focusing on critical areas like security, development, and community engagement. Overall, the project has strong potential for broad, scalable impact, but its success will depend on the effective execution of its development plans.",
