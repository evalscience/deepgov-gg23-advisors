        "description": "DeCleanup Network is a global community of impact creators working together to drive measurable environmental change. Our mission is to motivate individuals and communities worldwide to engage in environmental cleanups while ensuring their contributions are recognized, rewarded, and verifiable through Web3 technology.\n\nAt its core, DeCleanup Network leverages the power of community action, decentralized incentives, and transparent proof-of-impact verification. The core product, the DeCleanup dApp serves as a tool that empowers participants to self tokenize their real-world environmental efforts, creating a cycle of positive impact and rewards.\n\nDeCleanup dApp allows participants to:\n- Submit proof-of-impact (before/after geotagged photos) for cleanups.\n- Mint DeCleanup Impact Products - onchain commodities in a shape of dynamic NFTs, representing verified impact.\n- Earn $DCU for verified cleanup actions, with bonuses for streaks, referrals, and high-impact cleanups.\n- Track their environmental contributions on dashboard, check progress of other users through a dynamic leaderboard and ranking system.\n\n## Problem We Solve:\nEnvironmental pollution and waste accumulation are global challenges. Most cleanup efforts depend on volunteer work with limited recognition, minimal incentives, and no standardized tracking. DeCleanup Network introduces a gamified, transparent, and scalable solution by rewarding real-world impact through tokenized assets and decentralized verification.\n\n## How Will It Work in V2.1\n**Proof of Impact (PoI) Submission:**\n- Participants submit geotagged before/after photos via the DeCleanup dApp.\n- Verification in Phase 1 is team-based; Phase 2 introduces decentralized staking-based verification.\n**Tokenized Impact:**\n- Verified cleanups are minted into DeCleanup Impact Products - ERC-721 tokens reflecting cleanup history and impact value.\n- DeCleanup Impact Products have evolving traits (Level, Impact Value) based on user performance.\n**Rewards & Incentives:**\n- Participants earn $DCU convertible to $DCU tokens at TGE.\n- Streak bonuses, leaderboard rankings, and referral multipliers drive engagement.\n\n**Open-Source Development Progress**\nDeCleanup Network has actively engaged with the open-source developer community to build a scalable and decentralized platform. We have participated in two major hackathons through the [OnlyDust platform](https://onlydust.com), accelerating progress toward a fully decentralized and user-friendly dApp.\n\n**ODBoost (Jan 2025) – Foundational Stage**\nIn the first hackathon, the focus was on establishing a strong foundation for the dApp’s architecture, organizing the development workflow, and preparing for future scalability.\n\nKey Achievements\n- Project Maintainers Recruited: Identified and onboarded experienced Web3 developers through the OnlyDust platform.\n- Established contribution guidelines and developer onboarding processes.\n- Opened GitHub issues to enable new contributors to work on specific features.\n- dApp V2 Figma Design Completed: Finalized comprehensive UI/UX design for dApp V2, focusing on user experience and seamless cleanup submission flow.\n- Established the foundational smart contract logic for $DCU (ERC-20) and DeCleanup Impact Product (ERC-721).\n- CI/CD & security enhancements\n- Designed to support scalable reward distribution and real-time metadata updates.\n- Created detailed GitHub issues aligned with V2.1 specifics to support organized and transparent contributions.\n- Established a roadmap for future milestones and feature expansions.\n\n**ODBuild (Feb 2025) – The Coordination** \nIn the second hackathon we participated in, the focus shifted toward implementing core backend functionality and initiating smart contract integration while coordinating with open-source contributors.\n\nKey Achievements:\n- Created initial logic for staking, reward calculation, and metadata progression.\n- Organized the backend repository to support future development and integration with the frontend.\n- Established clear code architecture for Proof of Impact processing and reward allocation.\n- Began analyzing pull requests from contributors related to $DCU and DeCleanup Impact Product contracts.\n- Designed most of the elements of the frontend, preparing it with integration with smart contracts.\n- Coordinated with contributors to fix bugs, improve logic, and align with reward distribution mechanisms.\n\n**Upcoming OD Hackathon (March 2025) – Finalization and Pre-Launch Readiness**\nThe March 2025 hackathon will focus on finalizing the product across all key components - smart contract, backend, and frontend - to prepare for a successful public launch. The goal is to integrate, test, and optimize all technical layers, ensuring that the platform is scalable, secure, and user-friendly.\n\nKey Goals:\n- Backend Infrastructure Completion:\nFinalize the backend architecture.\nImplement transaction handling for cleanup submissions, reward distribution, and metadata updates.\n\n- Proof of Impact Verification & Automation - develop a secure submission flow with:\n1. Geotag and timestamp verification.\n2. Photo consistency checks (framing, background objects).\n3. Anti-fraud detection to prevent duplicate or manipulated submissions.\n4. Automate metadata updates upon cleanup verification.\n5. Ensure data integrity and security in the verification process.\n\n- Smart Contract Completion and Optimization: finalize and deploy smart contracts for:\n1. $DCU (ERC-20): Handle staking, reward calculation, and slashing.\n2. DeCleanup Impact Products (ERC-721): Establish metadata progression and reward multipliers.\n3. Optimize gas fees to reduce transaction costs.\n4. Secure the mint function to prevent unauthorized minting or supply manipulation.\n\n- Gamification & User Incentives: create a real-time leaderboard to track cleanup activity and user ranking and implement: \n1. Streak-based bonuses for consistent participation.\n2. Referral tracking to reward network growth.\n3. Reward multipliers based on Impact Value and cleanup frequency.\n\n- UX/UI Optimization:\n1. Improve frontend performance and simplify user onboarding.\n2. Finalize mobile responsiveness and navigation flow.\n3. Create a streamlined claiming process for DeCleanup Impact Products.\n\nThe March hackathon will serve as the final technical milestone before public launch, focusing on scalability, security, and user experience. This phase will align the backend, frontend, and smart contracts into a cohesive, integrated platform - setting the foundation for global adoption and decentralized community governance.\n\n## Roadmap\nPhase 2 – Expansion and Decentralization (In Progress):\n- Transition to staking-based community verification model.\n- Multi-chain expansion (Superchain Eco, Polygon zkEVM).\n- Enhanced incentives and gamification (Impact Circles, referral multipliers).\n- Regen Bazaar integration for Impact Products staking and trading.\n\nPhase 3 – Full Decentralization and Cross-Chain Expansion (2025):\n- Full community governance model.\n- Cross-chain compatibility with other chains, including Supra and Stellar.\n- Enhanced impact metrics (CO2 offset, waste removed, location significance).\n\nPhase 4 – Future Evolution:\n- Global ambassador program.\n- Token liquidity provision.\n\n## Additional Sources: \n- DeCleanup V1 on Arbitrum: [open](https://decleanup.net)\n- DeCleanup Network Pitchdeck: [open](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGf53DDD2w/vPpp5UvG3f-9rHCDJpylKA/view?utm_content=DAGf53DDD2w&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h8467560098)\n- DApp V2.1 Figma design: [open](https://www.figma.com/design/gcIv3YALbv8eFTJjXm3aUK/DCU-%E2%80%94-V2-(Copy)?node-id=0-1&t=lNZyY6zfO7qvKXgD-1)\n- Full flow prototype of the next versions: [open](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGa70P3H9I/g2rqJn8-hsOxOeyy8yqE4g/view?utm_content=DAGa70P3H9I&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h7ae241b0bb)\n",

      "description": "DeCleanup Network is a global community of impact creators working together to drive measurable environmental change. Our mission is to motivate individuals and communities worldwide to engage in environmental cleanups while ensuring their contributions are recognized, rewarded, and verifiable through Web3 technology.\n\nAt its core, DeCleanup Network leverages the power of community action, decentralized incentives, and transparent proof-of-impact verification. The core product, the DeCleanup dApp serves as a tool that empowers participants to self tokenize their real-world environmental efforts, creating a cycle of positive impact and rewards.\n\nDeCleanup dApp allows participants to:\n- Submit proof-of-impact (before/after geotagged photos) for cleanups.\n- Mint DeCleanup Impact Products - onchain commodities in a shape of dynamic NFTs, representing verified impact.\n- Earn $DCU for verified cleanup actions, with bonuses for streaks, referrals, and high-impact cleanups.\n- Track their environmental contributions on dashboard, check progress of other users through a dynamic leaderboard and ranking system.\n\n## Problem We Solve:\nEnvironmental pollution and waste accumulation are global challenges. Most cleanup efforts depend on volunteer work with limited recognition, minimal incentives, and no standardized tracking. DeCleanup Network introduces a gamified, transparent, and scalable solution by rewarding real-world impact through tokenized assets and decentralized verification.\n\n## How Will It Work in V2.1\n**Proof of Impact (PoI) Submission:**\n- Participants submit geotagged before/after photos via the DeCleanup dApp.\n- Verification in Phase 1 is team-based; Phase 2 introduces decentralized staking-based verification.\n**Tokenized Impact:**\n- Verified cleanups are minted into DeCleanup Impact Products - ERC-721 tokens reflecting cleanup history and impact value.\n- DeCleanup Impact Products have evolving traits (Level, Impact Value) based on user performance.\n**Rewards & Incentives:**\n- Participants earn $DCU convertible to $DCU tokens at TGE.\n- Streak bonuses, leaderboard rankings, and referral multipliers drive engagement.\n\n**Open-Source Development Progress**\nDeCleanup Network has actively engaged with the open-source developer community to build a scalable and decentralized platform. We have participated in two major hackathons through the [OnlyDust platform](https://onlydust.com), accelerating progress toward a fully decentralized and user-friendly dApp.\n\n**ODBoost (Jan 2025) – Foundational Stage**\nIn the first hackathon, the focus was on establishing a strong foundation for the dApp’s architecture, organizing the development workflow, and preparing for future scalability.\n\nKey Achievements\n- Project Maintainers Recruited: Identified and onboarded experienced Web3 developers through the OnlyDust platform.\n- Established contribution guidelines and developer onboarding processes.\n- Opened GitHub issues to enable new contributors to work on specific features.\n- dApp V2 Figma Design Completed: Finalized comprehensive UI/UX design for dApp V2, focusing on user experience and seamless cleanup submission flow.\n- Established the foundational smart contract logic for $DCU (ERC-20) and DeCleanup Impact Product (ERC-721).\n- CI/CD & security enhancements\n- Designed to support scalable reward distribution and real-time metadata updates.\n- Created detailed GitHub issues aligned with V2.1 specifics to support organized and transparent contributions.\n- Established a roadmap for future milestones and feature expansions.\n\n**ODBuild (Feb 2025) – The Coordination** \nIn the second hackathon we participated in, the focus shifted toward implementing core backend functionality and initiating smart contract integration while coordinating with open-source contributors.\n\nKey Achievements:\n- Created initial logic for staking, reward calculation, and metadata progression.\n- Organized the backend repository to support future development and integration with the frontend.\n- Established clear code architecture for Proof of Impact processing and reward allocation.\n- Began analyzing pull requests from contributors related to $DCU and DeCleanup Impact Product contracts.\n- Designed most of the elements of the frontend, preparing it with integration with smart contracts.\n- Coordinated with contributors to fix bugs, improve logic, and align with reward distribution mechanisms.\n\n**Upcoming OD Hackathon (March 2025) – Finalization and Pre-Launch Readiness**\nThe March 2025 hackathon will focus on finalizing the product across all key components - smart contract, backend, and frontend - to prepare for a successful public launch. The goal is to integrate, test, and optimize all technical layers, ensuring that the platform is scalable, secure, and user-friendly.\n\nKey Goals:\n- Backend Infrastructure Completion:\nFinalize the backend architecture.\nImplement transaction handling for cleanup submissions, reward distribution, and metadata updates.\n\n- Proof of Impact Verification & Automation - develop a secure submission flow with:\n1. Geotag and timestamp verification.\n2. Photo consistency checks (framing, background objects).\n3. Anti-fraud detection to prevent duplicate or manipulated submissions.\n4. Automate metadata updates upon cleanup verification.\n5. Ensure data integrity and security in the verification process.\n\n- Smart Contract Completion and Optimization: finalize and deploy smart contracts for:\n1. $DCU (ERC-20): Handle staking, reward calculation, and slashing.\n2. DeCleanup Impact Products (ERC-721): Establish metadata progression and reward multipliers.\n3. Optimize gas fees to reduce transaction costs.\n4. Secure the mint function to prevent unauthorized minting or supply manipulation.\n\n- Gamification & User Incentives: create a real-time leaderboard to track cleanup activity and user ranking and implement: \n1. Streak-based bonuses for consistent participation.\n2. Referral tracking to reward network growth.\n3. Reward multipliers based on Impact Value and cleanup frequency.\n\n- UX/UI Optimization:\n1. Improve frontend performance and simplify user onboarding.\n2. Finalize mobile responsiveness and navigation flow.\n3. Create a streamlined claiming process for DeCleanup Impact Products.\n\nThe March hackathon will serve as the final technical milestone before public launch, focusing on scalability, security, and user experience. This phase will align the backend, frontend, and smart contracts into a cohesive, integrated platform - setting the foundation for global adoption and decentralized community governance.\n\n## Roadmap\nPhase 2 – Expansion and Decentralization (In Progress):\n- Transition to staking-based community verification model.\n- Multi-chain expansion (Superchain Eco, Polygon zkEVM).\n- Enhanced incentives and gamification (Impact Circles, referral multipliers).\n- Regen Bazaar integration for Impact Products staking and trading.\n\nPhase 3 – Full Decentralization and Cross-Chain Expansion (2025):\n- Full community governance model.\n- Cross-chain compatibility with other chains, including Supra and Stellar.\n- Enhanced impact metrics (CO2 offset, waste removed, location significance).\n\nPhase 4 – Future Evolution:\n- Global ambassador program.\n- Token liquidity provision.\n\n## Additional Sources: \n- DeCleanup V1 on Arbitrum: [open](https://decleanup.net)\n- DeCleanup Network Pitchdeck: [open](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGf53DDD2w/vPpp5UvG3f-9rHCDJpylKA/view?utm_content=DAGf53DDD2w&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h8467560098)\n- DApp V2.1 Figma design: [open](https://www.figma.com/design/gcIv3YALbv8eFTJjXm3aUK/DCU-%E2%80%94-V2-(Copy)?node-id=0-1&t=lNZyY6zfO7qvKXgD-1)\n- Full flow prototype of the next versions: [open](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGa70P3H9I/g2rqJn8-hsOxOeyy8yqE4g/view?utm_content=DAGa70P3H9I&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h7ae241b0bb)\n",
