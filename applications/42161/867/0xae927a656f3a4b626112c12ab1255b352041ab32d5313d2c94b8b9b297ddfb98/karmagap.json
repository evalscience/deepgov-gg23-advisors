          "description": "### Basic Details\n\nDecentralized Cleanup was born as GreenPill Phangan chapter’s initiative in Thailand. The idea was to reward local and global communities for their random or organized cleanup efforts. The demo version featured registration form with proof of cleanup and NFT certificate of participation built on Unlock Protocol. \n\nToday DeCleanup Network is a blockchain-based platform designed to incentivize and reward global environmental cleanup efforts through digital assets. By leveraging blockchain technology, DeCleanup creates a transparent and verifiable system for rewarding individuals and communities for their environmental contributions. Participants use a decentralized application (DApp) to document cleanups, submit evidence, and receive digital assets as rewards. This initiative aims to foster global participation in environmental stewardship, with plans to scale and integrate into broader blockchain ecosystems.\n\n### What Has Been Done\n\n#### DApp and Dynamic NFT Collection\n\n![Screenshot of the Main Page](https://beige-defiant-spoonbill-537.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmWjckBnwWkidWtTQwR17TrQWoo9j3FX5LLwRg8s3n12cN)\n\nTo date, we have launched the dApp on the Arbitrum chain. You can visit the page [here](https://decleanup.net). We didn’t make official announcements yet as we are fixing last bugs and making sure all the steps of the process are working well.\n\nThe main feature of our rewards program is the collection of dynamic NFTs, themed around cleanup activities and designed to incentivize and reward participants for their environmental cleanup efforts. Each NFT reward can be upgraded (with 10 steps of progress) as users provide photos from different cleanup events.\n\nThe collection items have common traits that remain consistent with each NFT upgrade:\n- **Category**: Cleanup NFT\n- **Type**: Dynamic\n- **Impact**: Environment\n\nThere are dynamic traits, which grow every three cleanups:\n- **Rarity**: Common (1-3 cleanups), Rare (4-6 cleanups), Legendary (7-9 cleanups), Unique (10 cleanups)\n- **Level**: Newbie (1-3 cleanups), Pro (4-6 cleanups), Hero (7-9 cleanups), Guardian (10 cleanups)\n\nAnd dynamic traits which grow with every cleanup done:\n- **Impact Value**: 1 (first cleanup) to 10 (last cleanup)\n- **DCU Points**: 10 (first cleanup) to 100 (last cleanup)\n\nWhile the first two categories of traits determine the general information required for this product’s classification on the Impact Marketplace, and also gives the ranking to the user, the last category are main dynamic traits, which will determine the value of the NFT on the Impact Marketplace in the future and user’s onchain rank. Read more on this topic in the article by EcoSynthesisX [here](https://mirror.xyz/ecosynthesisx.eth/zOdeuaeFfJUFScZZKu1OGF7cWCiRgUHQSGE-14cf8fo).\n\n![Example of Traits](https://beige-defiant-spoonbill-537.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmfUA1PomqfsXPZod2oo79nrMq17xT1Rxo8EdWxwFFVHxM)\n\n#### Establishing Initial Partnerships\n\nWe have also completed community outreach planned for the first stage. The conversation was recorded on [X space](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1OwGWNjjQOqKQ), where we discussed the vision for DeCleanup Network development with partners around the world. There is also a detailed article on [Mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz/0x173D87dfa68aEB0E821C6021f5652B9C3a7556b4/ZzncKRu-Q-leEZkQ48Txm-NQRxG_hH3V3wyHaYUKfY).\n\nWe have established our first line of partners to drive our marketing campaign. Main partners include communities committed to organizing at least one cleanup a month, ideally on Monthly Earth Day, to support the environmental movement started by Crypto Whales NFT - [Highly Artistic](https://x.com/highlyartistic?s=21). These community leaders will receive a comprehensive guide on using the DeCleanup Rewards dApp and will get first-hand support necessary for the initial stage. They will then pass this knowledge to the next layer of users.\n\nOur initial partners in this category, GreenPill Phangan and ReFi Phangan, are among the most active participants in the Monthly Earth Day movement and early adopters of the program. There is a significant need for cleanups in this region, as improperly disposed trash often ends up at burning sites, causing severe air pollution. You can see their latest cleanup report [here](https://x.com/refiphangan/status/1815683299542761801?s=61).\n\nAnother partner, [Aqua Purge web3](https://x.com/aquapurgeweb3?s=21), organized a significant three-location [cleanup in Kenya](https://x.com/decentracleanup/status/1813189876155883700?s=61) for Monthly Earth Day in July. They are planning to start community onboarding to DeCleanup rewards and other incentives from our partners.\n\nAdditionally, we have ReFi Tulum, who consistently support Monthly Earth Day and are eager to introduce their community to crypto incentives. Their latest cleanup report can be found [here](https://x.com/refitulum/status/1815469046550479276?s=61).\n\nWe also collaborate with projects that create various cleanup incentives. For example, DeCleanup and [Cleanify](https://x.com/cleanify_vet?s=21) have a collaborative strategy to promote each other, motivating both communities to organize more cleanups, and providing additional incentives for them.\n\n### What Needs To Be Done\n\n1. **Official Launch (TBA)**: The project begins with its initial launch on the Arbitrum chain, introducing first three levels of rewards to incentivize early participants.\n\n2. **Communities Activation (22.11.2024)**: This phase focuses on finishing onboarding of partners onboard, including both leaders and participants, to establish a foundation for the network's growth.\n\n3. **Marketing (Q1 2025)**: Marketing efforts aim to engage communities, drive participation, build partnerships, and promote key initiatives like Monthly Earth Day events.\n\n4. **Expansion (Q2 2025)**: The platform eventually expands to multiple blockchain networks, increasing its reach and involving more global communities and partners.\n\n5. **DeCleanup 2.0 (Q4 2025)**: This final phase involves the full rollout of the platform with all planned features, evaluating performance, refining strategies, and ensuring the project’s sustainability for long-term success.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDeCleanup Network promotes environmental stewardship by incentivizing cleanup efforts through blockchain technology, fostering a global community of environmentally conscious individuals and organizations. By integrating with broader blockchain ecosystems, it enhances the overall impact and reach of blockchain technology for public goods.\n",

Our dApp allows individuals and communities to self-tokenize their cleanup efforts, creating measurable and tradable environmental impact assets.\n\nSpecific contributions to the OSS ecosystem include:\n- Decentralized proof of impact: We provide an open-source model for submitting and verifying real-world environmental actions using staking-based community validation, creating a trustless system for impact tracking.\n- Incentivized environmental action: By tokenizing cleanups into dynamic Impact Products (dIPs), we create a sustainable incentive model that combines DeFi rewards with social impact.\n- Community-driven growth: The DeCleanup dApp allows for decentralized governance and reward distribution, reinforcing open-source principles of collective ownership and transparent decision-making.\n- Partnership-driven expansion: We’ve established partnerships with ReFi DAO, GreenPill Network, Aqua Purge Web3, and other environmental organizations, promoting cross-project collaboration and building a unified Web3 impact ecosystem.\n- Open-source codebase: Our backend (Express.js), frontend (Next.js), and smart contracts (Solidity) are open-source, allowing developers to contribute and improve the platform."
