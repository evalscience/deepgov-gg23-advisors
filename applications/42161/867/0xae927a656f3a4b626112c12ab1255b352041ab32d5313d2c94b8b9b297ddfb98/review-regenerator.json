  "summary": "The Decentralized Cleanup Network project aims to leverage Web3 technology to incentivize environmental cleanups through a decentralized application (dApp). The project proposes a model where participants can submit proof of their cleanup efforts, which are then verified and tokenized into dynamic NFTs. These tokens can be used to earn rewards, fostering a gamified and community-driven approach to environmental sustainability. The project is in its developmental phase, with plans to expand its network and enhance its reward model using the grant funds.",
  "review": "The Decentralized Cleanup Network presents a compelling proposal that aligns well with the round's focus on open-source dApps and apps that offer novel utilities and services. The project demonstrates a strong commitment to environmental sustainability by integrating ecological considerations into its core operations, as evidenced by its focus on incentivizing real-world environmental cleanups through tokenization and decentralized verification (\"DeCleanup Network contributes to the OSS ecosystem by introducing an innovative model that combines real-world environmental impact with decentralized Web3 incentives\").\n\nThe project also shows innovation in its application use cases by combining social impact, gamification, and DeFi incentives into a single model, which is a novel approach in the Web3 space (\"Combines social impact, gamification, and DeFi incentives in a single model\"). This aligns with the model specification's emphasis on innovative and experimental approaches.\n\nHowever, the project is still in its developmental phase, with many features and smart contracts yet to be deployed (\"all our contracts are in development and not deployed yet\"). This presents a risk, as the project's success heavily depends on the successful implementation and deployment of these components. Additionally, while the project outlines a clear roadmap and use of grant funds, the lack of deployed contracts and reliance on future developments may impact its ability to deliver on its promises in the short term.\n\nOverall, the project aligns well with the constitutional principles and values, particularly in terms of innovation, environmental sustainability, and community participation. However, the current lack of deployed infrastructure and reliance on future developments are significant weaknesses that need to be addressed to ensure the project's success.",
