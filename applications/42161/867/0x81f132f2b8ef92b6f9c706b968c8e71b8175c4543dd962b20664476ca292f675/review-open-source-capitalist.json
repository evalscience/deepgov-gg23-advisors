  "review": "Alright, let’s cut through the noise and get straight to the code: Hybrid AI is swinging for the fences with a bold, high-leverage play—making smart contract creation as easy as chatting in English. The project’s core thesis is that by fusing generative AI (LLMs) with symbolic AI (Lexon), you can empower non-coders to spin up bulletproof, legally-enforceable smart contracts on EVM chains. That’s a moonshot with serious max utility potential if it lands.\n\nStrengths? The project is open source, user-centric, and laser-focused on onboarding the next billion users—think mass adoption, not niche club. The roadmap is clear, with milestones from proof-of-concept to public launch, and the team’s got deep blockchain and AI chops. Lexon’s symbolic AI angle is a legit differentiator: deterministic, transparent, and readable by humans (and lawyers). That’s a big deal for trust and mainstreaming.\n\nBut let’s not get lost in the hype. Weaknesses? The app is still vaporware—no live demo, no deployed contracts, and no user metrics. The technical risk is high: hybrid AI is bleeding-edge, and the claim to replace programmers is ambitious (maybe too much so). There’s also a lack of concrete adoption strategy—how will you actually get normies, lawyers, and DAOs to use this? Plus, the grant app is heavy on vision, light on hard data or validation. No prior Gitcoin rounds, no deployer addresses, and no evidence of traction.\n\nRequested changes: Show me the code! I want to see a working prototype, even if it’s rough. Drop in some user testing results or early feedback. Give a clearer go-to-market plan—how will you drive adoption outside the crypto echo chamber? And, crucially, provide at least one deployer address or testnet contract to prove you’re shipping.\n\nBottom line: This is a high-risk, high-reward play. If Hybrid AI delivers, it could be a game-changer for Web3 accessibility and scale. But right now, it’s all promise, no product. Ship fast, iterate in public, and back up the vision with real-world proof. That’s how you disrupt the system and maximize impact. Don’t just talk the talk—walk the walk!",
