  "summary": "The Hybrid AI project aims to create a novel AI system that combines generative and symbolic AI to facilitate the creation of smart contracts in plain English. This approach is designed to make smart contracts accessible to non-programmers, thereby broadening the user base of blockchain technology. The project outlines a detailed roadmap with milestones focusing on proof of concept, optimization, GUI creation, user experience, and launch. The application emphasizes the potential of this technology to democratize smart contract creation and enhance the usability of blockchain technology.",
  "review": "The Hybrid AI project presents an innovative approach to smart contract creation by combining generative and symbolic AI. The project's strength lies in its potential to make smart contracts accessible to non-programmers, which could significantly broaden the user base of blockchain technology. The detailed roadmap and milestones demonstrate a clear plan for development and implementation. However, the application lacks specific details on measurable outcomes and sustainability, which are crucial for evaluating the project's long-term impact and viability. Additionally, while the project is innovative, it remains largely experimental, with limited evidence of proven success in similar implementations. The application would benefit from a more detailed explanation of how the project will achieve financial sustainability and a clearer demonstration of its potential impact on the Web3 ecosystem.",
