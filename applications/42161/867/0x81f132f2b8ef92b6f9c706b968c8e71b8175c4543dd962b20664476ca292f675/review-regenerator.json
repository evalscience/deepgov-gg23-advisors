  "summary": "The grant application for the Hybrid AI project aims to develop a novel AI system that combines generative and symbolic AI to create smart contracts in plain English. This approach seeks to make smart contracts more accessible to non-programmers, thereby broadening the user base of blockchain technology. The project outlines a detailed roadmap with specific milestones, including proof of concept, optimization, GUI creation, user experience testing, and launch. The application emphasizes the potential of this technology to transform the way smart contracts are created and used, making them a part of everyday life for a wide range of users.",
  "review": "The Hybrid AI project presents an innovative approach to smart contract creation by integrating generative and symbolic AI. The application is well-structured, providing a comprehensive roadmap and clear objectives. The project's focus on making smart contracts accessible to non-programmers aligns with the round's goal of enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability. However, the application lacks specific details on community involvement and environmental sustainability, which are important aspects of the model specification. Additionally, while the project is innovative, the application could benefit from more concrete examples of how it will achieve its ambitious goals.",
