  "summary": "OpenLitterMap is an open-source project that integrates real-time data collection with gamification to address litter and plastic pollution. The project has a significant global reach, with over 8,200 users in 100+ countries contributing more than 500,000 images. Users earn Littercoin, a digital currency that can be spent with eco-friendly merchants, incentivizing environmental action. The project aims to release a new version, gather feedback, and expand its team significantly.",
  "review": "OpenLitterMap presents a compelling case for funding due to its innovative approach to environmental data collection and gamification. The project aligns well with the round's goals of enhancing Web3 accessibility and contributing to social impact. Its global reach and user engagement demonstrate a scalable impact, aligning with the model's emphasis on maximizing utility and systemic change. However, the application lacks detailed information on the deployment of smart contracts and specific plans for the use of grant funds, which are critical for assessing the project's feasibility and alignment with open-source principles.",
