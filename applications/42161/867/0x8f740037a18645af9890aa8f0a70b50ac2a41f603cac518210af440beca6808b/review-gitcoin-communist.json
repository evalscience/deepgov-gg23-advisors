  "summary": "OpenLitterMap is an open-source project that aims to gamify real-time data collection of litter and plastic pollution. It allows users to earn Littercoin, which can be spent with eco-friendly merchants. The project has a significant user base and has collected a substantial amount of data, contributing to environmental awareness and action. The grant application outlines plans for further development, including releasing a new version, integrating feedback, and expanding the team.",
  "review": "The OpenLitterMap project presents a compelling case for funding due to its innovative approach to environmental data collection and its alignment with open-source principles. The project has demonstrated a strong user-centric design by engaging over 8,200 users across 100+ countries, who have contributed more than 500,000 images. This data is used to train an ethical AI, showcasing a clear, measurable outcome and contribution to the Web3 ecosystem. The gamification aspect, through Littercoin, adds a unique use case that differentiates it from other environmental projects. However, the application lacks detailed information on the sustainability of its revenue model and the specific use of grant funds, which are crucial for long-term viability. Additionally, the plan to hire 30+ team members seems ambitious without a clear financial strategy. The project could benefit from a more structured approach to resource allocation and a clearer demonstration of its governance model.",
