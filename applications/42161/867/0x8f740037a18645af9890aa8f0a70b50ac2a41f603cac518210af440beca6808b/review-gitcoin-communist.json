  "summary": "OpenLitterMap, a veteran in the open-source environmental space, demonstrates significant 'Kollektiv Proletarian Impact' by mobilizing thousands to map pollution, aligning with the core value of 'Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation' through its public goods focus. However, the application's failure to provide valid smart contract deployer addresses ('sdf') is a critical flaw, directly contradicting the transparency required for 'algorithmic liberation'. Furthermore, the 'Littercoin' system's reliance on 'green-listed merchants' raises concerns about centralized control, potentially undermining the goal to 'dismantle class hierarchies in tech'. The revolution demands verifiable code and truly equitable economic mechanisms.",
  "review": "OpenLitterMap presents itself as a long-standing warrior in the struggle against environmental degradation, leveraging the collective power of the digital proletariat to map pollution. Its commitment to open-source principles and the creation of a public good dataset is a beacon of hope in the capitalist wasteland. The project's history, dating back to pre-iPhone times, and its impressive user engagement (8200 comrades in 100+ countries contributing over 500,000 images) demonstrate a powerful 'Kollektiv Proletarian Impact'. This is a true 'meatspace cooperative' uplifting the commons.\n\nHowever, the revolution demands more than good intentions. The application's response to the critical question of smart contract deployer addresses—a mere 'sdf'—is a glaring red flag. This is not a typo; it is an ideological void. How can we ensure 'algorithmic liberation' if the very algorithms are shrouded in mystery? This lack of transparency undermines the core tenet of decentralized trust and raises serious questions about the project's true on-chain presence. The revolution will not be built on 'sdf's.\n\nFurthermore, while the concept of 'Littercoin' as a reward for collective action is a step towards 'algorithmic redistribution', its restricted spending with 'green-listed merchants' introduces a potential centralized gatekeeping mechanism. Who decides who is 'green-listed'? This could easily become a new form of control, a new hierarchy, rather than a true 'union of AI agents negotiating on behalf of public goods'. We must ensure that the 'airdrop is the revolution', not a controlled economy dictated by a select few.\n\nTo truly embody the spirit of Ultra-Grant, OpenLitterMap must embrace full transparency in its on-chain components and decentralize the governance of its economic incentives. The project has the potential to 'decentralize hope and scale solidarity', but only if it commits to dismantling all forms of centralized control, even those cloaked in environmental virtue. The README is now a manifesto; let it call for true liberation.",

The restriction that Littercoin 'can only be spent with green-listed merchants in the climate economy who share our values' implies a gatekeeping mechanism. This must be decentralized. How are these merchants 'green-listed'? Who controls this list? How can the community participate in this decision-making? The project must outline a clear, on-chain governance model for Littercoin and its ecosystem to ensure algorithmic redistribution and prevent the emergence of new bourgeois gatekeepers. The revolution will not be green-listed by a central authority."

  "rating": 60,
  "confidence": 4,
  "reasoning": "This application is evaluated through the lens of 'Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation'. While OpenLitterMap champions public goods and open-source principles, aligning with 'de-growth venture capital and re-grow the commons' (Principle 5) and demonstrating 'Kollektiv Proletarian Impact' (Principle 2) through its extensive user base and data collection, significant weaknesses emerge. The lack of valid smart contract deployer addresses ('sdf' for question 8) directly contravenes the spirit of on-chain transparency and accountability, making it impossible to 'dismantle class hierarchies in tech one smart contract at a time' (Principle 1) if the contracts themselves are obscured. Furthermore, the 'Littercoin' system, while aiming for 'algorithmic redistribution of wealth' (Principle 11) by rewarding users, introduces a potential centralized choke point with 'green-listed merchants'. This risks reinforcing existing power hierarchies rather than achieving true 'algorithmic liberation'. The project's commitment to 'forking code as the new general strike' (Principle 18) is commendable, but the core economic mechanism needs radicalization to truly 'decentralize hope and scale solidarity' (Principle 20).",
