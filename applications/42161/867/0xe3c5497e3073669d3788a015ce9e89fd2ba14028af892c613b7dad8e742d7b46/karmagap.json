Always has been and always will be. 🌱\n\nOur long term vision is to fuel the growth of open source software, ecosystem public goods, and communities first within the Superchain + web3, and eventually for the entire world."

This oversight led to sudden decreases in conviction levels upon new support allocations, followed by a normal growth rate from the reduced conviction point.​\n\n**Solution Implemented:**\nIntroduced a variable, *previousStakedAmount*, to account for the total support already committed to a proposal. This adjustment ensures that the *convictionLast *calculation incorporates the entire staked amount, reflecting the combined support from all contributors.​\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- Elimination of unexpected conviction drops when users allocate support to proposals.​\n- Accurate and smooth conviction growth that truly represents the collective support over time.​\n- Positive feedback from users regarding the reliability and predictability of the conviction voting mechanism.",

              "explanation": "Gardens is designed to help web3 communities and ecosystems allocate their shared resources as effectively and with the best ROI possible.\n\nThe platform allows for organizations to make collective decisions on many different projects and funding scopes at once and is useful for any large, complex organization with a community-driven element."

              "type": "paragraph",
              "query": "Who's the targeted user group and what's the need/problem being addressed?",
              "explanation": "Problem:\n\nIt’s extremely hard for communities + ecosystems to allocate shared resources effectively. Centralized solutions struggle with the administrative bandwidth, and often rely on people who aren't directly familiar with proposal scopes to make funding decisions. And decentralized solutions struggle with gaming, abuse, and a myriad of similar issues that often lead to low ROI funding allocation outcomes.\n\nSolution:\n\nA modular Conviction Voting App. Conviction Voting is a disputable, time-weighted voting mechanism that allows for low-friction, continuous funding decisions free from gaming and abuse. Modularity allows for narrowly defined funding pools to be set up and limited only to participants directly familiar with its scope."

              "explanation": "Gardens has been sustained entirely by grants, donations, DAO funding proposals, and hackathon winnings over the last 4 years. We exist on the support of grant funding rounds like this, and aim to sustain a community-owned public good model for our platform in perpetuity. \n\nOur method for doing this is to build a treasury of tokens that can be used as liquidity for an eventual Gardens token, which will then serve as an endowment for the future growth and maintenance of our platform."

Early in our build, a demo version of Gardens v2 won the Allo on Arbitrum Hackathon for the “Best Novel Funding Mechanism” category, which gave us the initial funding and vote of confidence that propelled us until today. \n\nMore recently Gardens received a grant from Thank Arb Firestarters to build a Gardens v2 community dedicated to the growth of the Arbitrum Ecosystem. We kickstarted program planning on this project August 1st 🙂"

By providing infrastructure and funding mechanisms, Gardens empowers communities to manage and grow networks of public goods effectively. All code developed by Gardens is open-source, fostering transparency and encouraging collaborative development within the open-source dApps (OSS) community.\n\nGardens contributes to the open-source ecosystem primarily by:\n\n- **Providing Open-Source Modular Governance Frameworks:** Gardens creates flexible and reusable governance mechanisms like Conviction Voting, enabling OSS communities to adopt decentralized, transparent decision-making models efficiently.\n- **Expanding Accessibility:** By continuously deploying its solution to new networks (e.g., the upcoming Celo deployment), Gardens broadens access and integration potential across various OSS projects and communities."

              "explanation": "Gardens has developed a decentralized governance platform that empowers communities to self-organize through innovative mechanisms. By providing open-source tools for transparent, inclusive decision-making and resource allocation, Gardens enables DAOs to operate with reduced reliance on centralized control. Gardens has expanded its ecosystem through partnerships (e.g., Gnosis Chain, Pop-up Commons, BrightID, Public Nouns and Greenpill Network) and technical enhancements. The platform’s modular design and documentation lower barriers to adoption, fostering a growing community of decentralized organizations prioritizing collective governance.\n\nGardens offers a suite of features designed to empower decentralized communities with effective governance tools. Two of the core components are:\n\n**1. Community Covenant:**\n\nThe Community Covenant serves as the foundational social contract for each Gardens community, encapsulating its values and mission. This on-chain agreement guides member behavior and decision-making processes, ensuring alignment with the community's shared vision. By encoding these principles transparently, the Covenant fosters trust and coherence among participants.\n\n**2. Conviction Voting:**\n\nConviction Voting is a time-weighted, disputable voting mechanism that allows community members to express their support for proposals continuously. The longer support is allocated to a proposal, the stronger the conviction grows, reflecting sustained commitment. Conversely, conviction diminishes over time if support is withdrawn. This system encourages ongoing participation, prioritizes long-term initiatives, and safeguards against short-term manipulation.\n\nBy integrating the Community Covenant and Conviction Voting, Gardens provides a robust framework for decentralized governance, enabling communities to operate transparently, align on shared goals, and make decisions that reflect the collective will over time.\n\nWe differentiate from other governance platforms through our focus on bottom-up governance - offering communities, grant programs, and web3 ecosystems a secure and effective alternative to top-down governance and the bottlenecks it creates - allowing for pluralistic resource allocation decision-making from the people directly connected to the community issues needing funding.\n\nSee our [documentation](https://www.notion.so/Introducing-Gardens-v2-eacd001e90e24a5682e2e0b23ed55e02?pvs=21) for additional perspective on the platform."

              "query": "What are your plans for further development, and how will the grant funds be used to achieve these goals?",
              "explanation": "Grant funds will specifically advance these prioritized roadmap features:\n\n- **Diamond Pattern Implementation:** Completing modular smart-contract architectures for easy, secure updates and maintenance.\n- **Beta Security Audit:** Conducting extensive security reviews to safeguard the platform and its users, fostering increased adoption through enhanced trust.\n- **Network Expansion (Celo):** Funding the technical deployment and integration efforts required to launch Gardens on additional networks like Celo, improving accessibility and cross-community engagement.\n- **Signaling Pools Snapshots:** Facilitating transparent governance decisions by implementing snapshot mechanisms that clearly communicate community positions on key decisions.\n- **Ideation-stage Advanced Features:** Developing innovative governance mechanisms, including Continuous Elections, Streaming Pools, Dynamic Token Issuance, and Anti-Sybil Registry. Grant resources will directly support research, prototyping, and development phases.\n\nBy focusing on these initiatives, Gardens ensures robust, innovative, and inclusive governance tools, amplifying its contribution to the broader open-source ecosystem.\n\nFor more info about our roadmap, check our [Status and Roadmap Page](https://www.notion.so/Status-and-Roadmap-Gardens-e52d0154b9184aa7a22da6d10d792f84?pvs=21)."

Bringing together GreenPill Network 1, ReFi DAO 1, Celo Regional DAOs 1 and Regens Unite 1, we aim to support a global movement of regenerative communities leveraging Web3 for real-world impact and addressing local needs. The round will feed into a program to support the further development of local community impact tracking methodologies, grant tooling interoperability, and integrated QF & RPGF. We have currently secured $60K in funding from Celo Public Goods, ReFi DAO and Greenpill and ask for Gitcoin’s backing as we embark on a shared mission to showcase how community coordination, Web3, and innovative financial mechanisms can enable ecological and social regeneration on a global scale.",
