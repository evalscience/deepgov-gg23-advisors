  "summary": "Gardens üå± offers a robust, open-source framework for decentralized governance, deeply aligning with principles of community participation and transparent decision-making. While its core strength lies in empowering collective resource allocation, its direct contributions to cultural preservation and environmental harmony, vital tenets of Gross National Happiness, remain largely dependent on its application by communities. üèîÔ∏è",
  "review": "Gardens üå± presents a compelling vision for decentralized coordination, offering a modular governance framework built on principles of transparency and bottom-up decision-making. The project's emphasis on the \"Community Covenant\" and \"Conviction Voting\" directly resonates with our constitutional principles of **Community Participation and Inclusion (5, 7, 8)** and **Transparency and Ethical Governance (13, 16)**. By empowering communities to self-organize and allocate resources, Gardens fosters local ownership and autonomy, moving away from centralized control. The disputable nature of Conviction Voting further enhances accountability and citizen feedback.\n\nThe project's commitment to open-source development, as evidenced by its actively maintained GitHub repository and stated philosophy (\"All of our code is open-source. Always has been and always will be\"), aligns well with fostering technological independence and collaborative innovation. Its planned expansion to networks like Celo demonstrates a commitment to broadening accessibility, which can indirectly support **digital inclusion (36)**.\n\nHowever, from a Gross National Happiness perspective, the application's focus is primarily on governance mechanics rather than explicit integration with cultural heritage or direct environmental conservation. While it aims to improve \"ROI for expenditures on public goods,\" the specific nature of these public goods and their alignment with **cultural preservation (9-12)** or **environmental sustainability (17-20)** is not detailed. This presents a gap in its direct alignment with the holistic balance principles of GNH.\n\nThe mention of \"Ideation-stage Advanced Features\" like \"Anti-Sybil Registry\" is promising for ensuring fair participation, but the broader ethical implications of \"AI and digital technologies\" as per **principle 14** are not elaborated. Similarly, while the project aims for \"collective well-being,\" the specific \"holistic well-being indicators\" beyond economic or transactional metrics, as per **principle 35**, are not defined.\n\nOverall, Gardens üå± is a powerful tool for good governance and community empowerment within the Web3 space. Its potential to contribute to collective well-being and community flourishing (**principle 40**) is significant, provided that the communities adopting it consciously integrate the broader GNH principles into their covenants and funding decisions. The project's established partnerships and consistent development history indicate a capable team and a viable path forward.",

  "reasoning": "The decision is strongly influenced by the project's alignment with Community Participation and Inclusion (Principles 5, 7, 8), which are central to our constitutional values of empowering citizens and fostering local autonomy. The transparent and accountable governance mechanisms, particularly Principle 13 and 16, are also highly valued. While the project excels in these areas, its current application lacks explicit detail on how it directly contributes to Cultural Heritage and Identity (Principles 9-12) and Environmental Harmony (Principles 17-20), which are crucial for a holistic approach to Gross National Happiness. The proposed changes aim to bridge these gaps, enhancing its overall alignment with our vision for harmonious technological development.",
