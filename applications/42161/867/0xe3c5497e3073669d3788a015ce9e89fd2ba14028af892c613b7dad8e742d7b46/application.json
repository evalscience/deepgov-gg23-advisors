By providing infrastructure and funding mechanisms, Gardens empowers communities to manage and grow networks of public goods effectively. All code developed by Gardens is open-source, fostering transparency and encouraging collaborative development within the open-source dApps (OSS) community.\n\nGardens contributes to the open-source ecosystem primarily by:\n\n- **Providing Open-Source Modular Governance Frameworks:** Gardens creates flexible and reusable governance mechanisms like Conviction Voting, enabling OSS communities to adopt decentralized, transparent decision-making models efficiently.\n- **Expanding Accessibility:** By continuously deploying its solution to new networks (e.g., the upcoming Celo deployment), Gardens broadens access and integration potential across various OSS projects and communities.",

          "answer": "Gardens has developed a decentralized governance platform that empowers communities to self-organize through innovative mechanisms. By providing open-source tools for transparent, inclusive decision-making and resource allocation, Gardens enables DAOs to operate with reduced reliance on centralized control. Gardens has expanded its ecosystem through partnerships (e.g., Gnosis Chain, Pop-up Commons, BrightID, Public Nouns and Greenpill Network) and technical enhancements. The platform’s modular design and documentation lower barriers to adoption, fostering a growing community of decentralized organizations prioritizing collective governance.\n\nGardens offers a suite of features designed to empower decentralized communities with effective governance tools. Two of the core components are:\n\n**1. Community Covenant:**\n\nThe Community Covenant serves as the foundational social contract for each Gardens community, encapsulating its values and mission. This on-chain agreement guides member behavior and decision-making processes, ensuring alignment with the community's shared vision. By encoding these principles transparently, the Covenant fosters trust and coherence among participants.\n\n**2. Conviction Voting:**\n\nConviction Voting is a time-weighted, disputable voting mechanism that allows community members to express their support for proposals continuously. The longer support is allocated to a proposal, the stronger the conviction grows, reflecting sustained commitment. Conversely, conviction diminishes over time if support is withdrawn. This system encourages ongoing participation, prioritizes long-term initiatives, and safeguards against short-term manipulation.\n\nBy integrating the Community Covenant and Conviction Voting, Gardens provides a robust framework for decentralized governance, enabling communities to operate transparently, align on shared goals, and make decisions that reflect the collective will over time.\n\nWe differentiate from other governance platforms through our focus on bottom-up governance - offering communities, grant programs, and web3 ecosystems a secure and effective alternative to top-down governance and the bottlenecks it creates - allowing for pluralistic resource allocation decision-making from the people directly connected to the community issues needing funding.\n\nSee our [documentation](https://www.notion.so/Introducing-Gardens-v2-eacd001e90e24a5682e2e0b23ed55e02?pvs=21) for additional perspective on the platform.",

Grant resources will directly support research, prototyping, and development phases.\n\nBy focusing on these initiatives, Gardens ensures robust, innovative, and inclusive governance tools, amplifying its contribution to the broader open-source ecosystem.\n\nFor more info about our roadmap, check our [Status and Roadmap Page](https://www.notion.so/Status-and-Roadmap-Gardens-e52d0154b9184aa7a22da6d10d792f84?pvs=21).",
