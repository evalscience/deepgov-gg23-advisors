  "summary": "The Gardens project is an open-source governance framework designed to enhance decentralized coordination within web3 ecosystems. It aims to empower communities by providing infrastructure and funding mechanisms to manage and grow networks of public goods effectively. The project emphasizes transparency, inclusivity, and community-driven governance through features like the Community Covenant and Conviction Voting. The grant funds are intended to advance key roadmap features, including security audits, network expansion, and the development of innovative governance mechanisms.",
  "review": "The Gardens project presents a compelling case for enhancing decentralized governance within the web3 ecosystem. Its focus on open-source principles and community empowerment aligns well with the round's eligibility criteria, particularly in terms of contributing to the growth of the OSS ecosystem and presenting innovative use cases. The project's emphasis on modular governance frameworks and partnerships with other networks demonstrates a commitment to expanding accessibility and integration potential across various OSS projects. However, the application could benefit from more detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a clearer sustainability model to reduce dependency on continuous donations. Additionally, while the project highlights its innovative governance mechanisms, it should provide more concrete examples of how these mechanisms have been successfully implemented and their impact on community governance.",
