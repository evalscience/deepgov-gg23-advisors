      "output": "I couldn't find specific information about a project named 'poster.fun'. However, there are several initiatives and methodologies that utilize interactive posters for data collection and scientific communication. Here's an overview of some related projects:\n\n**1. Interactive Data-Gathering Posters in Animal Welfare Research**\n\nA study titled \"Interactive Data-Gathering Posters as a Research Tool: A Case Study Assessing Public Opinion on Incorporation of Natural Behavior into Management Systems\" explored the use of interactive posters to collect public opinions on animal welfare. The methodology involved creating a poster with brief infographics and numbered stickers, allowing participants to rank their top three areas of importance regarding natural behavior in goats. This approach was piloted at various events, including an international conference and a regional veterinary conference. The study demonstrated that such interactive posters could effectively gather stakeholder views and promote engagement in research.

Poster Development and Presentation in Scientific Inquiry**\n\nAnother initiative focused on enhancing scientific inquiry and communication skills through poster development. This project involved students formulating hypotheses, designing experiments, collecting and interpreting data, and presenting their findings through posters. The process emphasized inquiry-based learning and peer review, aiming to improve students' understanding of the scientific method and their ability to communicate research effectively. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5969404/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. Cost-Effective Poster Creation for Educational Events**\n\nFor schools and educational institutions, creating cost-effective posters is essential for promoting events and announcements. Guidelines suggest using free or low-cost graphic design software like Canva, GIMP, and Inkscape, and opting for minimalist designs with limited colors to reduce printing expenses. Additionally, utilizing standard poster sizes and in-house printing can further economize the process.

Research Posters in Sustainability Symposiums**\n\nAt the Johns Hopkins University Sustainability Symposium 2025, several research posters were presented, including topics like zero-carbon electricity plans and clean water initiatives. These posters served as platforms for students and researchers to communicate their findings and engage with the academic community on sustainability issues.
