  "summary": "The Gardens project is an open-source governance framework designed to enhance decentralized coordination within web3 ecosystems. It aims to empower communities by providing infrastructure and funding mechanisms to manage and grow networks of public goods effectively. The project emphasizes transparency, inclusivity, and innovative governance tools such as Conviction Voting and Community Covenant. The grant funds are intended to advance key roadmap features, including security audits, network expansion, and the development of advanced governance mechanisms.",
  "review": "The Gardens project presents a compelling case for enhancing decentralized governance within the web3 ecosystem. Its focus on open-source principles and innovative governance tools aligns well with the round's objectives of promoting open-source dApps and apps. The project's emphasis on transparency and inclusivity, through mechanisms like the Community Covenant and Conviction Voting, demonstrates a commitment to fostering a healthy and participatory community environment. However, while the project outlines ambitious plans for further development, including network expansion and security audits, it lacks detailed metrics for measuring impact and success. Additionally, the application could benefit from a clearer explanation of how these developments will directly contribute to the broader web3 ecosystem growth and financial inclusion.",
