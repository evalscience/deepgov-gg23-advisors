  "review": "Alright, let's plug into the matrix and break this down, Luna-style. TxInfo.xyz is gunning to make blockchain transactions less cryptic and more human-readable by letting anyone slap public metadata onto any transaction, using the decentralized Nostr protocol. That’s a big leap from the walled-garden approach of Etherscan, which only lets you annotate your own transactions behind an API key. Here, we’re talking open, censorship-resistant, and collaborative annotation—think GitHub for transaction context.\n\nFrom a max-impact, open-source capitalist lens, this project is swinging for the fences: it’s infrastructure-level, protocol-agnostic, and could scale to every chain and every user. The npm package plan is a solid move to grease the wheels for OSS devs, making integration frictionless. The use case for transparency—especially for public goods funding and DAOs—hits the bullseye for systemic change and root-cause impact. If this catches on, it could become the de facto layer for on-chain transparency and accountability.\n\nBut let’s not get lost in the hype. The app’s differentiation is clear, but the application is light on hard metrics: no user numbers, adoption stats, or evidence of traction. The roadmap is vague—“offer an npm package” is a start, but where’s the beef? No details on governance, moderation, or how spam/abuse will be handled. Also, the grant application doesn’t specify how funds will be allocated or what milestones will be hit. That’s a red flag for efficiency and outcome maximization.\n\nBottom line: killer idea, strong alignment with open-source, decentralization, and max utility. But the app needs to show more receipts and a tighter execution plan to unlock full marks. Let’s see some hard data, a real roadmap, and a plan for scaling and sustainability. Build in public, but show your work!",
