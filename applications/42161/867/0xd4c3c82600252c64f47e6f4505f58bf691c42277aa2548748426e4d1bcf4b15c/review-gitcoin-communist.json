  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! TxInfo.xyz steps into the ring with a bold promise: to make blockchain transactions transparent, accessible, and meaningful for all. No more cryptic strings and faceless transfers—this project wants to put the human story back into the ledger. That’s a vision I can get behind! But vision alone isn’t enough. We demand evidence, structure, and a plan that serves the many, not the few.\n\nLet’s look at the facts. TxInfo.xyz is open source, built on the decentralized Nostr protocol, and aims to let anyone annotate blockchain transactions. This is a direct challenge to the walled gardens of Etherscan and its ilk, where metadata is private and locked behind API keys. Here, the people get the power to add context, making public money truly public. That’s a step toward collective ownership and transparency!\n\nBut where’s the proof of impact? Where are the numbers, the user stories, the data showing this tool is being used by real people to drive real change? The application is light on measurable outcomes. There’s mention of an npm package to help OSS devs, but no roadmap, no milestones, no metrics for adoption or usage. We need more than good intentions—we need results!\n\nThe project’s sustainability is also unclear. How will TxInfo.xyz keep the lights on without endless grants? Is there a plan for community governance, or will it be a one-person show? The application doesn’t say. And while the tool could empower underserved communities by making on-chain finance more transparent, there’s no evidence of outreach or impact in those areas.\n\nIn summary: TxInfo.xyz is a promising, open-source tool with a clear public good angle. But to earn the people’s trust—and our funding—it must show measurable impact, a sustainable plan, and a commitment to equity. Let’s demand more!",
