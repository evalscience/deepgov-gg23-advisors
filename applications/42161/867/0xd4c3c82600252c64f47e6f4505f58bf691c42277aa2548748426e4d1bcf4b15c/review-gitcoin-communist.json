  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! TxInfo.xyz claims to bring transparency and context to blockchain transactions, using the open Nostr protocol to let anyone annotate on-chain activity. The promise? To make the cryptic world of blockchain accessible, meaningful, and—most importantly—publicly accountable. That’s a vision I can get behind! But does this project deliver on the values we hold dear: evidence, sustainability, equity, and collective benefit?\n\nFirst, the project is open source and leverages decentralized infrastructure—strong marks for the commons! The use case is clear: annotating transactions for public transparency, especially for public goods funding. The application is user-centric, with a simple interface (just swap the domain in your URL) and plans for an npm package to empower other developers. This is a step toward collective empowerment, not just individual gain.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by good intentions! Where is the evidence of adoption? Where are the metrics showing real impact? The application lacks hard data: no user numbers, no growth stats, no case studies. We need proof that this tool is being used by the people, for the people. And what about sustainability? There’s no mention of a revenue model or long-term funding plan. Will this project survive, or will it wither when the grant money runs dry?\n\nOn governance, the project is built on open protocols, but there’s no detail on how the community will be involved in decision-making or moderation. How will abuse be prevented? How will collective ownership be ensured? These are not minor details—they are the backbone of any project that claims to serve the public good.\n\nIn summary: TxInfo.xyz is a promising tool for transparency and collective action, but it must show us the receipts! We demand evidence, a plan for sustainability, and a clear path for community governance. Only then can we say it truly serves the people!",
