  "summary": "Ecosystem Vision is a platform designed to aggregate and curate data about the crypto ecosystem, including organizations, projects, and funding sources. The project aims to enhance transparency and provide valuable insights into the open-source software (OSS) ecosystem by reporting on funding and project metrics. The team plans to rebrand to veri.xyz and focus on defensive systems against malicious actors. The grant funds will be used to cover infrastructure costs and support full-time engineers.",
  "review": "The Ecosystem Vision project presents a comprehensive approach to aggregating and curating data within the crypto ecosystem. The project aligns well with the round's goals of enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability, as it provides a platform for users to find funding opportunities and gain insights into the ecosystem. The project demonstrates user-centric design by offering an AI grant finder and aims to contribute to the growth of the Web3 ecosystem by providing transparency and data-driven insights. However, the application lacks specific details on how the project will achieve its long-term goals and how the defensive systems will be implemented. Additionally, the project could benefit from a clearer explanation of its innovation in application use cases and how it differentiates from existing solutions. The application meets the general eligibility criteria for Gitcoin Grants, including open-source principles and ethical standards.",
