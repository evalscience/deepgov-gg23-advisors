  "summary": "Ecosystem Vision is a platform designed to enhance the transparency and accessibility of funding information within the crypto ecosystem. It aggregates data on organizations, projects, and funding sources, providing metrics and insights to support open-source projects. The project aims to pivot to a new brand, veri.xyz, focusing on defensive systems against malicious actors. The grant will be used to cover infrastructure costs and support full-time engineers.",
  "review": "The Ecosystem Vision project presents a comprehensive approach to aggregating and curating data about the crypto ecosystem, which aligns well with the round's focus on enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability. The project demonstrates a strong commitment to transparency by openly reporting funding data and providing clear metrics. Its innovative use of AI to find suitable grant programs and its extensive database of organizations and projects are notable strengths. However, the application lacks specific details on how the pivot to veri.xyz will be executed and how the defensive systems will be developed. Additionally, the project could benefit from a clearer explanation of its user-centric design and functionality, as well as more information on its contribution to financial inclusion and social impact. The application meets the general eligibility criteria for Gitcoin Grants, but further elaboration on these aspects would strengthen its case.",
