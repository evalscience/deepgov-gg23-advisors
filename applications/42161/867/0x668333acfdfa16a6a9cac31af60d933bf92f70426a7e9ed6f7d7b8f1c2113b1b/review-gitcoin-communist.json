  "summary": "Ecosystem Vision is a platform designed to enhance the transparency and accessibility of funding information within the crypto ecosystem. It aggregates data on organizations, projects, and funding sources, providing metrics and insights to support open-source projects. The project aims to pivot to a new brand, veri.xyz, focusing on defensive systems against malicious actors. The grant funds will be used to cover infrastructure costs and support full-time engineering efforts.",
  "review": "The Ecosystem Vision project presents a comprehensive approach to aggregating and curating data about the crypto ecosystem, which aligns well with the round's focus on enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability. The project demonstrates a clear understanding of the ecosystem's needs by addressing issues such as the lack of clarity in grant programs and the need for verifiable contact points. The use of AI to find suitable grant programs and the aggregation of funding data are innovative features that contribute to the project's differentiation. However, the application lacks detailed information on measurable outcomes and sustainability plans, which are crucial for long-term impact and alignment with the model specification's principles. The pivot to veri.xyz and the focus on defensive systems are promising, but the application should provide more specifics on how these plans will be executed and measured.",
