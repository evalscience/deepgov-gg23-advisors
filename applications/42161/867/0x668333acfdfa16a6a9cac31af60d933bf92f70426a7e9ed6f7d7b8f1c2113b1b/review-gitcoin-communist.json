  "review": "Comrades, let’s get straight to the heart of the matter! Ecosystem Vision claims to be the one-stop platform for learning about the crypto ecosystem, aggregating data on thousands of organizations, projects, and funding sources. They tout transparency, open-source values, and a mission to empower founders and builders. But do they deliver on the promises that matter most to the people?\n\nFirst, the project’s user-centric design is evident: the AI grant finder and curated lists are practical tools for real users seeking funding and trustworthy partners. The platform’s focus on transparency—reporting on funding, project activity, and verifiable contacts—directly addresses rampant scams and opacity in the space. This is a real, tangible benefit to the commons.\n\nSecond, Ecosystem Vision’s contribution to the Web3 ecosystem is clear. By aggregating data from reputable sources (Karma GAP, OpenSource Observer) and building unique data pipelines, they provide a public good that benefits all, not just a select few. Their open-source approach and public GitHub repository further reinforce their commitment to the collective.\n\nHowever, let’s not be blinded by rhetoric! The application lacks rigorous, quantifiable outcome metrics. Where are the hard numbers on user adoption, impact, or ecosystem growth? There’s mention of thousands of organizations and projects, but no evidence of how this data has been used to drive measurable change. The plans for a pivot to veri.xyz and building defensive systems are promising, but again, where’s the roadmap, the milestones, the evidence of sustainable impact?\n\nSustainability is another concern. The project is currently grant-dependent, with no clear revenue model or plan for long-term financial independence. This is a red flag for any movement seeking to build lasting, self-sustaining public goods. The team’s global composition and fair compensation goals are commendable, but without a path to sustainability, the risk of dependency looms large.\n\nFinally, while the project claims to serve a global community, there’s little detail on how benefits are distributed across regions or how underserved populations are prioritized. Equity demands more than good intentions—it demands action and evidence!\n\nIn summary: Ecosystem Vision is a strong, community-minded project with real utility and a clear commitment to open-source values. But to earn the people’s trust—and the people’s resources—they must show us the numbers, the plan, and the path to sustainability. Let’s demand more than promises. Let’s demand proof!",
