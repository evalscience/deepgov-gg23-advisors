  "review": "Comrades, let’s get straight to the heart of the matter! Ecosystem Vision claims to be the people’s aggregator—a one-stop shop for learning about the crypto ecosystem, finding grants, and exposing the true flows of funding. The project’s mission is clear: transparency, accessibility, and collective empowerment. But does it deliver on these promises? Let’s dig in, with the people’s interests at the forefront!\n\nFirst, the project’s open-source credentials are solid. The GitHub repo is public, and the team has a track record of contributing to the Web3 grants ecosystem. They aggregate data from thousands of organizations and projects, providing a valuable public good. Their AI grant finder and funding transparency tools are real steps toward democratizing access to resources. This is the kind of infrastructure that can level the playing field for builders everywhere, not just the privileged few!\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by good intentions. Where is the hard evidence of impact? The application is heavy on vision and features, but light on measurable outcomes. How many users have found grants through the platform? What is the quantifiable impact on financial inclusion, education, or social good? The people demand numbers, not just promises!\n\nSustainability is another concern. The project relies on grants and has no clear revenue model. How will it survive when the grant money dries up? We need systems that endure, not just flash in the pan experiments. The team must show a path to sustainability—otherwise, we risk building sandcastles at low tide.\n\nOn governance and equity, the team is global and diverse, which is a strength. But there’s little detail on how community input shapes the platform or how underserved populations are prioritized. If this is truly a tool for the many, not the few, let’s see mechanisms for community governance and outreach to marginalized builders.\n\nFinally, the application is missing a public group chat link and provides no smart contract deployment details. Transparency demands completeness! Every detail matters when we’re building for the commons.\n\nIn summary: Ecosystem Vision is a promising project with a strong foundation, but it must do more to prove its impact, plan for sustainability, and empower the community. The revolution demands results, not just rhetoric!",
