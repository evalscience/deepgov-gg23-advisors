  "summary": "Ecosystem Vision offers valuable transparency and data aggregation for the Web3 ecosystem, aligning with the constitutional principle of transparent governance (Principle 13). Its focus on combating malicious actors also contributes to a safer digital space. However, the application currently lacks explicit alignment with core Gross National Happiness principles, particularly regarding cultural preservation, direct community inclusion beyond Web3 builders, and environmental sustainability. It is a strong project for general Web3 health, but its roots do not yet deeply intertwine with Bhutan's unique vision of holistic well-being. üèîÔ∏è",
  "review": "Ecosystem Vision presents itself as a vital tool for enhancing transparency and understanding within the broader Web3 ecosystem. Its core offering of aggregating funding data, tracking OSS project metrics, and providing an AI-powered grant finder is a commendable effort to bring clarity to a complex space. The project's commitment to building 'defensive systems to guard against malicious actors' is a significant strength, contributing to the overall security and trustworthiness of the open-source landscape. This aligns well with the general eligibility criteria of contributing to Web3 ecosystem growth and presenting innovation in application use cases.\n\nFrom the perspective of Gross National Happiness, the project's emphasis on transparency (Principle 13: 'blockchain and digital tools for transparent, accountable governance and funding processes') is a clear positive. By openly reporting funding and providing clear metrics, it fosters a more accountable environment, which can indirectly support collective well-being by reducing scams and increasing trust. The development of bespoke data pipelines also speaks to building local technological capabilities (Principle 32: 'builds local technological capabilities and AI expertise').\n\nHowever, the project's current scope does not deeply resonate with several other foundational GNH principles. There is no explicit mention of how this technology harmonizes with cultural heritage preservation (Principle 1), integrates traditional wisdom (Principle 2), or promotes Dzongkha and local languages (Principle 9). The focus on 'founders' and 'trustworthy counterparties' within the Web3 space, while valuable, does not directly address broader community engagement or ensuring meaningful access for vulnerable groups within Bhutan (Principles 5, 6). Furthermore, there is no indication of environmental sustainability considerations (Principles 17, 18, 19) or how success would be measured through holistic well-being indicators beyond economic or project-centric metrics (Principle 35). While beneficial for the global Web3 space, its direct contribution to Bhutan's unique GNH vision remains largely unarticulated.",
