  "summary": "Creova is a decentralized, milestone-based funding platform designed to empower developers and creators by offering community crowdfunding and DAO-backed Treasury Grants. The project aims to reduce dependency on centralized gatekeepers and expand financial accessibility for open-source software (OSS) tools, public goods, and mission-aligned innovation. Creova is built on Ethereum and is fully open-source, ensuring transparency and trust. The platform differentiates itself by offering tokenless participation, Treasury-backed grants, KYC-based trust layers, and optional AI-based milestone verification. The grant funds will be used to enhance frontend UX, deploy to Polygon and Optimism, implement decentralized KYC and contributor reputation tracking, and integrate an open project explorer and impact dashboard.",
  "review": "Creova presents a compelling case for funding as it aligns well with the round's focus on accelerating the adoption and development of open-source dApps and apps. The project demonstrates a strong commitment to user-centric design and functionality by offering a decentralized, transparent platform for funding. It contributes to the Web3 ecosystem by providing a novel utility that enhances financial accessibility and supports public goods funding infrastructure, directly aligning with Gitcoin's goals. The innovative use of milestone-based funding and DAO governance showcases a creative approach to persistent challenges in the crowdfunding space. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on how environmental sustainability is integrated into their project, as this is a key consideration in the model specification. Additionally, while the project is innovative, the application lacks specific examples of past successes or evidence of community involvement in decision-making processes, which are important aspects of the constitutional principles for regenerator.",
