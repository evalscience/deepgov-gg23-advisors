  "summary": "Creova is a decentralized, milestone-based funding platform designed to empower developers and creators by offering community crowdfunding and DAO-backed Treasury Grants. The project aims to reduce dependency on centralized gatekeepers and expand financial accessibility for open-source software (OSS) tools, public goods, and mission-aligned innovation. Creova is fully open-source and built on Ethereum, ensuring transparency and trust. The platform differentiates itself by offering tokenless participation, Treasury-backed grants, KYC-based trust layers, and optional AI-based milestone verification. The grant funds will be used to enhance frontend UX, deploy to Polygon and Optimism, implement decentralized KYC and contributor reputation tracking, and integrate an open project explorer and impact dashboard.",
  "review": "Creova presents a compelling case for funding as it aligns with the round's focus on accelerating the adoption and development of open-source dApps and apps. The project contributes to the Web3 ecosystem by providing a decentralized funding platform that enhances transparency and trust. Its hybrid funding model, combining crowdfunding and Treasury grants, is innovative and addresses the need for accountability in funding. The project is already live on Ethereum mainnet, demonstrating a level of maturity and readiness for further development. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a clear sustainability model, which are critical according to the model specification. The project should provide more data-driven insights and a robust plan for long-term sustainability to strengthen its application.",
