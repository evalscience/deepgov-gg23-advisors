  "summary": "The Helpers Foundation Web3 Impact Project aims to leverage blockchain technology to support public goods and social impact projects in Africa. It focuses on education, clean energy, healthcare, and financial inclusion through decentralized finance and crypto donations. The project emphasizes transparency, cross-chain compatibility, and user-friendly design to maximize accessibility and impact.",
  "review": "The Helpers Foundation Web3 Impact Project presents a compelling case for using blockchain technology to address social issues in Africa. The project aligns well with the round's focus on open-source dApps and apps that enhance Web3 accessibility and usability. It demonstrates a clear commitment to transparency and decentralized governance, which are crucial for building trust and encouraging participation in decentralized funding initiatives. The project's focus on education, clean energy, and healthcare aligns with the model specification's emphasis on long-term systemic change and addressing root causes of problems. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the project's current stage of development, specific metrics for measuring impact, and a clearer explanation of how the proposed innovations will be implemented. Additionally, the project should address potential challenges in scaling and maintaining the platform across multiple blockchain networks.",
