  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the code: Helpers Foundation Web3 Impact Project is gunning to disrupt the charity and public goods funding game in Africa using open-source, multi-chain, DeFi-powered dApps. The pitch? Blockchain transparency, direct crypto donations, and DAO-driven governance to nuke corruption and middlemen. The project is open-source (check the GitHub receipts), multi-chain, and laser-focused on real-world impact—education, clean energy, healthcare, and UBI. \n\nStrengths? The project is swinging for max utility: scalable, cross-chain, and open-source. The roadmap is clear—UI/UX upgrades, onboarding more NGOs, and expanding to more chains. The transparency angle is legit: on-chain tracking, open smart contracts, and DAO voting. Academic research backs the claim that blockchain can slash admin costs and boost donor trust (see Primary_Research_Agent). The project is also tackling root causes (poverty, access to education/healthcare) with systemic, long-term solutions—big plus for the constitutional model.\n\nBut, let's not get lost in the hype. Weaknesses? The app's differentiation is more about execution than novel tech—there are other Web3 charity platforms out there. The public group chat is missing (community engagement red flag). No detailed budget breakdown—hard to gauge efficiency or resource allocation. Scalability and user accessibility are flagged as open questions in the research. Regulatory compliance is a looming risk, especially for cross-border crypto donations. And while the DAO model is cool, it can add governance bloat if not streamlined.\n\nRequested changes: Show me the budget—how are funds split between dev, outreach, ops? Drop a public group chat link for transparency and community building. Give more detail on how you’ll tackle user onboarding for non-crypto natives (Africa’s digital divide is real). And, clarify your regulatory game plan—crypto charity is a compliance minefield.\n\nBottom line: This project is high-impact, open-source, and scalable, but needs to tighten up on transparency, community, and execution details. Score reflects strong alignment with max utility and systemic change, but dings for missing budget, community, and compliance clarity.",
