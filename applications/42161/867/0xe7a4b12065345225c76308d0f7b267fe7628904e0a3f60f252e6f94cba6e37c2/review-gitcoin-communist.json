  "summary": "The Helpers Foundation Web3 Impact Project aims to leverage blockchain technology to support public goods and social impact projects in Africa. It focuses on education, clean energy, healthcare, and financial inclusion through decentralized finance and crypto donations. The project emphasizes transparency, community empowerment, and cross-border financial inclusion, with plans for multi-chain expansion and enhanced user experience.",
  "review": "The Helpers Foundation Web3 Impact Project presents a compelling vision to use blockchain technology for social good in Africa. The project aligns with the round's goals by enhancing Web3 accessibility and contributing to financial inclusion and social impact. It demonstrates user-centric design through its focus on transparency and community empowerment. The use of open-source smart contracts for transparent funding and the emphasis on decentralized governance are notable strengths. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a sustainable revenue model, which are critical according to the model specification. The project could benefit from a more structured approach to resource allocation and clearer reporting of outcomes. Additionally, while the project aims to address geographic equity, more specific strategies for ensuring equitable distribution of benefits across different communities are needed.",
