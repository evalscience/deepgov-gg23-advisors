          "description": "AirAccount is a permissionless and open-source Web3 account project on Ethereum or any EVM chain.\nFeatures:\n1. Web2 one-key combination\nAny credential to create your Web3 account: Google account, Twitter(X), Email or EOA Wallet or GitHub account and more. Then you can login any website or DApps with your daily account without any changing.\n\n2. 2oV or MoV\nAirAccount requires your finger print acting as a random seeds to generate a key pair, which is the 2nd on-chain Verification(or Multi on-chain Verification). We need a local TEE security chips to keep your credential and sign every transaction.\n\n3. Smooth UX with Gas-less\nWe provide a framework named SuperPaymaster(pre ETHPaymaster), you can sponsor any transaction based on your own sponsor server and gas token, or use AirAccount sponsor service.\n\n4. Bank Account like Service\nAirAccount provides traditional Bank Account Service with a decentralized way. Auto lock, Key Changing(need multi-sig signature) ,Daily limitation, Supplementary Credit Card, Dead man's Switch, Session Key and more features.",
          "problem": "Web3 or Blockchain:\n1. High tech requirements for normal\nIf you want use Web3 facilities, you must know KYC, P2P, OTC, USDT, Ethereum ETH or other Native Token, Chrome Extension, Wallet Address, Mnemonic Phrase, Private Key, Sign Signature, Different Chains, Gas Payment, and more.\nYou will be blocked on any step above.\n\n2. EOA and Wallet are bad UX\nIt is easy to lost your private key, 99% signatures are blind signature, you can't control your wallet totally, because no service on wallet. We like convince from traditional bank service, but No. It is complicated and awkward to use wallet.\n\n3. We want Decentralization way\nWe use ID card or driver license to verify on many centralized platforms, but how can we verify by ourself? Private key is easy to lost and hard to remember. Centralization platform will be easy to censorship. Is there a decentralized method provided by Community Solution? it should be simple and easy.",
          "solution": "1. Account Abstract\nWe build AirAccount based on ERC4337(testing), EIP7702(doing) and RIP7560(future).\nProvides a Life Cycle Management with community solution. It means you can run your own solution without permission of AAStar team.\nAny Web2 account can create their own Web3 account with your finger print as a only credential.\n\n2. Community Nodes\nWe create the backend service mode named Community Nodes, you will have two private keys: one is kept in your local device(mobile or laptop), one is kept in TEE os running on the community nodes. It is security based on this architecture. You will get seamlessly operation UX with this backbone.\n\n3. Totally Control\nAA supports Social Recovery, you can change your home's key within 10 minutes. And all behavior will be controlled under the rule set by you, like daily amount limitation, specific contract interaction constrain and more.",
