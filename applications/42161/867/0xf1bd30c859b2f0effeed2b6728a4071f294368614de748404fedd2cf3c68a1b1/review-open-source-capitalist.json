  "review": "The All Weather Protocol (AWP) presents a compelling solution for retail investors looking to diversify their crypto portfolios with ease. By utilizing Account Abstraction Wallet (AA Wallet) technology, AWP offers a unique approach that eliminates the need for smart contracts, thereby reducing associated risks. The project's focus on providing an intent-centric user experience aligns well with the round's emphasis on user-centric design and functionality. However, the application lacks detailed information on how the project will achieve its stated APY returns and the specific mechanisms behind its yield strategies. Additionally, while the project is open-source, more clarity on its contribution to the broader Web3 ecosystem would strengthen its case. The application could benefit from a more detailed roadmap and clearer metrics for success.",
