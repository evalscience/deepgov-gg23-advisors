  "summary": "Karma GAP is an onchain protocol designed to enhance transparency and accountability for grantees by allowing them to share project progress and fund utilization updates. The project aims to improve the visibility of funded projects and hold them accountable through onchain data storage. It also offers an SDK for building alternative UIs and tools. The grant funds are intended to further develop features, particularly focusing on Karma AI to assist funders in identifying impactful projects.",
  "review": "The Karma GAP project presents a compelling case for enhancing transparency and accountability in the funding ecosystem. By leveraging onchain data storage, it ensures that project updates and fund utilization are transparent and accessible. The integration of an SDK allows for further innovation and customization by third parties, which aligns with the open-source ethos. The focus on developing Karma AI to assist funders in identifying high-impact projects is a forward-thinking approach that could significantly enhance the efficiency of funding decisions. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on how the project specifically contributes to environmental sustainability and how it plans to engage diverse community stakeholders in its governance and decision-making processes.",
