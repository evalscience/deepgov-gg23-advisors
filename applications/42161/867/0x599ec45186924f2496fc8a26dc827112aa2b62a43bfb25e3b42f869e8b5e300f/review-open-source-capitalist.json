  "summary": "The DeSci Journals project aims to revolutionize scientific publishing by leveraging blockchain technology to create a decentralized, open-access platform. This platform enhances transparency, accessibility, and collaboration in scientific research, offering features like NFT-minted papers and a decentralized marketplace for scientific assets. The project aligns with the Decentralized Science (DeSci) movement, addressing issues like high publication fees and limited access to scientific knowledge. The grant will be used to develop Version 4, focusing on integrating a registration platform and expanding marketing efforts to drive adoption.",
  "review": "The DeSci Journals project presents a compelling case for transforming the scientific publishing industry by addressing key issues such as high publication fees and limited access to research. The application highlights the project's alignment with the DeSci movement, emphasizing open-access and decentralized publishing. The use of blockchain technology to mint papers as NFTs and create a marketplace for scientific assets is innovative and aligns with the round's focus on enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the project's current user base and specific metrics for measuring impact. Additionally, while the project outlines ambitious plans for future development, it lacks a clear timeline and budget breakdown for achieving these goals.",
