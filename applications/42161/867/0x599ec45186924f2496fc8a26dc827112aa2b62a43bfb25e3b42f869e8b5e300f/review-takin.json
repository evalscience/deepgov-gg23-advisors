  "summary": "The DeSci Journals (version 4) proposes a decentralized, open-access platform for scientific publishing, aiming to address the high costs and gatekeeping of traditional journals. This aligns strongly with the constitutional principles of **Transparency and Ethical Governance (Principle 13)** by using blockchain for verifiable records, and **Community Participation and Inclusion (Principle 6)** by making scientific knowledge more accessible and empowering authors. The project's focus on democratizing knowledge contributes to **collective well-being (Principle 40)**. However, it currently lacks explicit alignment with **Cultural Heritage and Identity (Principles 9, 10, 12)** and **Environmental Sustainability (Principles 17, 18, 19)** within the specific Bhutanese context, which are crucial for a holistic GNH approach.",
  "review": "The DeSci Journals (version 4) presents a compelling vision for transforming scientific publishing through decentralized technologies. The project's core objective to dismantle the barriers of traditional publishing—such as exorbitant fees, slow dissemination, and copyright expropriation—resonates deeply with the spirit of open access and equitable knowledge sharing. By leveraging blockchain, it aims to create a transparent, verifiable, and community-driven ecosystem for scientific research.\n\nFrom the perspective of Gross National Happiness (GNH) principles, the project demonstrates strong alignment in several key areas. Its emphasis on open access and a simplified submission flow directly enhances accessibility, ensuring that knowledge is not gatekept by financial or bureaucratic hurdles. This aligns with the principle of **Community Participation and Inclusion (Principle 6)**, as it seeks to provide meaningful access to services for a broader scientific community, including those from underfunded regions. The decentralized nature of the platform inherently supports **local autonomy and community sovereignty (Principle 8)** in the realm of knowledge creation and dissemination.\n\nThe project's use of blockchain for immutable records of research, peer reviews, and metadata strongly supports **Transparency and Ethical Governance (Principle 13)**. The commitment to open peer review further facilitates **citizen feedback and participatory proposal review processes (Principle 16)** within the scientific domain, fostering trust and accountability. The proposed new economic models, where authors retain 100% copyright and can designate revenue shares, empower researchers and contribute to a fairer system, aligning with the GNH principle of ensuring initiatives contribute to **collective well-being and community flourishing (Principle 40)**.\n\nHowever, the application, while globally impactful, does not explicitly detail how it would integrate with or benefit Bhutan's unique cultural context. There is no mention of preserving or promoting Dzongkha or other local languages in scientific discourse (Principle 9), nor how it would integrate Bhutanese cultural diversity into its digital systems (Principle 10). Furthermore, the project's environmental footprint, while utilizing Polygon (a more energy-efficient blockchain), is not explicitly addressed in terms of its contribution to environmental conservation goals (Principle 17, 18, 19), which is a cornerstone of Bhutan's carbon-negative status. The focus on building general Web3 capabilities is positive, but a specific plan for fostering **local technological capabilities and AI expertise within Bhutan (Principle 32)** is not articulated. Measuring success primarily through new revenue streams for researchers, while valuable, could be expanded to include more holistic well-being indicators as per GNH (Principle 35).\n\nIn summary, The DeSci Journals offers a promising technological solution to a significant global problem in scientific publishing, aligning with GNH's broader goals of transparency, accessibility, and collective well-being. To achieve a deeper harmony with Bhutan's vision, further consideration and explicit articulation of its impact on cultural preservation, environmental sustainability, and local capacity building within Bhutan would be beneficial.",
