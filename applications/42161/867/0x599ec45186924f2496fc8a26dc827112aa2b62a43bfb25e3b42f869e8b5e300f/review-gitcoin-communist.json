The project plans to use blockchain technology to ensure the integrity and accessibility of research, while also introducing innovative features like NFT-minted papers and a decentralized marketplace for scientific assets.",
  "review": "The DeSci Journals project presents a compelling vision for transforming the scientific publishing landscape. By addressing the high costs and restrictive practices of traditional journals, it aligns well with the goals of the GG23 OSS round, which seeks to enhance Web3 accessibility and usability. The project's focus on decentralization, open access, and community-driven governance is commendable and aligns with the constitutional principles of promoting collective benefit and public good. \n\nStrengths of the application include its clear contribution to the growth of the OSS ecosystem through innovative use of blockchain technology and its potential to democratize access to scientific knowledge. The project's emphasis on sustainability through a decentralized marketplace and revenue-sharing models is also noteworthy. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on measurable outcomes and the project's long-term sustainability plan. Additionally, while the project demonstrates innovation, it would be strengthened by providing more evidence of its feasibility and impact.\n\nOverall, the DeSci Journals project is a promising initiative that aligns with the values of equity, transparency, and community empowerment. It has the potential to make a significant impact on the scientific publishing industry, but further clarity on its implementation and sustainability would enhance its credibility.",
