By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure that research findings, peer reviews, and metadata remain openly accessible and verifiable, fostering trust and reproducibility. Our platform incentivizes OSS developers and researchers through reputation systems and NFT-minted papers. We integrate with open-source repositories like GitHub and decentralized storage solutions, allowing researchers to directly link and publish code alongside their studies for proper citation. This enables permissionless collaboration, allowing global contributors to expand, fork, and improve OSS projects without institutional gatekeeping. Additionally, we embed open-source licenses and ensure long-term data preservation through decentralized storage, protecting contributions from being lost or paywalled. By facilitating transparent and immutable publishing, we help researchers showcase and validate their work more effectively. Our approach not only supports OSS development but also strengthens the integrity of scientific research through open peer review. Through marketing efforts and community engagement, we promote the adoption of open science principles and decentralized publishing, making scientific knowledge more accessible, verifiable, and community-driven.",

This streamlined approach lowers barriers for researchers, making publication faster and more accessible. We also provide optional wallet integration, ensuring that non-Web3 users can participate without friction. A key differentiator is our percentage-based authorship allocation, allowing authors to designate revenue shares for laboratories, institutions, or companies when opting for paid access—ensuring that funds go directly to the authors' wallets. In Version 3, we introduced Web3 login and the ability to publish papers as NFTs, enabling a secondary market for scientific research. This fosters new economic models for knowledge dissemination, allowing researchers to retain ownership and monetize their work beyond traditional paywalls. By blending user-friendly design from Web2, our platform empowers scientists while redefining how research is published and accessed in the Web3 era.",

This version will introduce a new revenue stream, with the platform earning a small fee on each register transaction while fostering transparent and open exchange. Version 4 will be a crucial stepping stone toward Version 5, where we will expand into a fully decentralized marketplace, enabling the buying, selling, and trading of scientific paper NFTs and other assets. To achieve these goals, the grant will be used to redesign and integrate the registration platform into the publishing platform, ensuring seamless UI and functionality. Additionally for version 4, we will scale up marketing efforts, organizing targeted events, workshops, and community activations to raise awareness and onboard new users. Through strategic collaborations, we aim to drive adoption and establish our platform as a leading force in decentralized science innovation, ultimately paving the way for a fully operational scientific marketplace in Version 5.",

        "description": "A journal-as-a-service publications platform for collaborative creation of technical and scientific publications, leveraging web3 principles and technologies: 100% copyright to authors, different percentages of authorship (as built-in feature) and scientific assets construction (through blockchain registration). \n\nThe platform is aligned with the Decentralized Science (DeSci) movement regarding intellectual property protection, publishing and funding. We use a 1-page with simple and straightforward submission flow for both articles https://platform.desci.reviews/summary/new-document and journals (developed and deployed since version 2) https://platform.desci.reviews/summary/new-journal which is a new much simpler feature when compared to pages long used in traditional scientific journals. We made adding wallets optional.\n\nWe have also introduced features such as the percentage of authorship, which can include a percentage for laboratories, institutions and companies when authors choose paid access when funds go directly to the Author’s (or Authors’) wallet. \n\nFor version 3 we developed a web3 login and papers now can be published as NFTs to push forward a secondary market formation. \n\nBy using *The DeSci Journals* as platform for their technical and scientific publications which includes conferences an events, individuals and communities will capitalize on its technical merit.  They will also tap into a flourishing ecosystem that aligns with a broader vision for the future of science, building a portfolio of tradable scientific assets.\n\nFor version 4 we aim to redesign and integrate a register platform on the publishing platform for better UI integration with the Publishing Platform aiming to build a window showcase for projects/ ideas registered aiming to create a decentralized marketplace. The aim is to build a window showcase for projects/ ideas registered aiming to create a decentralized marketplace. A pilot marketplace aims to open a new revenue stream for researchers and startups while fostering an ecosystem for transparent and open exchange of scientific knowledge. The platform will earn a fee on each transaction. \n\nDown the road, for version 5, we plan to develop a decentralized marketplace where people can buy, sell, and trade NFTs of scientific papers and other scientific assets. This marketplace will not only provide a new revenue stream for researchers and startups but also create an ecosystem where scientific knowledge can be freely and transparently exchanged. By using an efficient, customizable, secure and scalable infrastructure, we can ensure smooth and cost-effective transactions within this marketplace. \n\nWe will also ramp up marketing efforts and organize targeted events to raise awareness about this new DeSci solution. Through community activations, workshops, and strategic collaborations, we aim to onboard new users and partners. These initiatives will help drive adoption, generate engagement, and position our project at the forefront of decentralized science innovation.\n\n## IMPACT\n**Why does it matter?**  Scientific publishing houses and science journals have outrageously high publication fees. These fees range from 2 to 6k USD for 1 paper, some charge 10k-15 USD/ paper. Open access is another 2-4k USD. Currently, it is right to say that the scientific publication industry hinders the advance of human knowledge. \nPaying attention only to their profits, legacy scientific journals: \n•\tAct as filters to what they believe is high quality research worth publishing;\n•\tuse high rejection rates which are uncoupled from merit, significance, and quality, \n•\ttake a long time from submission to publishing;\n•\tundermine the expectations of the scientific community and the development of the human society;\n•\tauthors (scientists, professionals and, scholars), reviewers and most editors (also scientists) do not get paid for working in the peer-reviewing process of papers for science journals. \n•\tAuthors: 1) pay for publishing, 2) pay for open access and moreover, 3) have their copyright expropriated. \n•\tUniversities and Research Institutions pay shockingly high annual subscription fees so that alumni and staff have access to journals.\n\n**Who will benefit from it?** Researchers, scientists, students, startups and companies which produce knowledge.

      "description": "A journal-as-a-service publications platform for collaborative creation of technical and scientific publications, leveraging web3 principles and technologies: 100% copyright to authors, different percentages of authorship (as built-in feature) and scientific assets construction (through blockchain registration). \n\nThe platform is aligned with the Decentralized Science (DeSci) movement regarding intellectual property protection, publishing and funding. We use a 1-page with simple and straightforward submission flow for both articles https://platform.desci.reviews/summary/new-document and journals (developed and deployed since version 2) https://platform.desci.reviews/summary/new-journal which is a new much simpler feature when compared to pages long used in traditional scientific journals. We made adding wallets optional.\n\nWe have also introduced features such as the percentage of authorship, which can include a percentage for laboratories, institutions and companies when authors choose paid access when funds go directly to the Author’s (or Authors’) wallet. \n\nFor version 3 we developed a web3 login and papers now can be published as NFTs to push forward a secondary market formation. \n\nBy using *The DeSci Journals* as platform for their technical and scientific publications which includes conferences an events, individuals and communities will capitalize on its technical merit.  They will also tap into a flourishing ecosystem that aligns with a broader vision for the future of science, building a portfolio of tradable scientific assets.\n\nFor version 4 we aim to redesign and integrate a register platform on the publishing platform for better UI integration with the Publishing Platform aiming to build a window showcase for projects/ ideas registered aiming to create a decentralized marketplace. The aim is to build a window showcase for projects/ ideas registered aiming to create a decentralized marketplace. A pilot marketplace aims to open a new revenue stream for researchers and startups while fostering an ecosystem for transparent and open exchange of scientific knowledge. The platform will earn a fee on each transaction. \n\nDown the road, for version 5, we plan to develop a decentralized marketplace where people can buy, sell, and trade NFTs of scientific papers and other scientific assets. This marketplace will not only provide a new revenue stream for researchers and startups but also create an ecosystem where scientific knowledge can be freely and transparently exchanged. By using an efficient, customizable, secure and scalable infrastructure, we can ensure smooth and cost-effective transactions within this marketplace. \n\nWe will also ramp up marketing efforts and organize targeted events to raise awareness about this new DeSci solution. Through community activations, workshops, and strategic collaborations, we aim to onboard new users and partners. These initiatives will help drive adoption, generate engagement, and position our project at the forefront of decentralized science innovation.\n\n## IMPACT\n**Why does it matter?**  Scientific publishing houses and science journals have outrageously high publication fees. These fees range from 2 to 6k USD for 1 paper, some charge 10k-15 USD/ paper. Open access is another 2-4k USD. Currently, it is right to say that the scientific publication industry hinders the advance of human knowledge. \nPaying attention only to their profits, legacy scientific journals: \n•\tAct as filters to what they believe is high quality research worth publishing;\n•\tuse high rejection rates which are uncoupled from merit, significance, and quality, \n•\ttake a long time from submission to publishing;\n•\tundermine the expectations of the scientific community and the development of the human society;\n•\tauthors (scientists, professionals and, scholars), reviewers and most editors (also scientists) do not get paid for working in the peer-reviewing process of papers for science journals. \n•\tAuthors: 1) pay for publishing, 2) pay for open access and moreover, 3) have their copyright expropriated. \n•\tUniversities and Research Institutions pay shockingly high annual subscription fees so that alumni and staff have access to journals.\n\n**Who will benefit from it?** Researchers, scientists, students, startups and companies which produce knowledge.
