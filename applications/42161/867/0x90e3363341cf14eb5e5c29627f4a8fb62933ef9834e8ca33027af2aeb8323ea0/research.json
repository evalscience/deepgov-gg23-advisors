  "project_overview": {
    "name": "Ether Guild",
    "objectives": [
      "To clarify why ETH is money by surfacing on-chain data and educational context.",
      "To provide transparent, reproducible visualizations of ETH’s role in the Ethereum economy.",
      "To open-source its codebase and data methods to support community contributions.",
      "To act as a public good for educators, advocates, researchers, and developers.",
      "To expand ethismoney.xyz with new graphs.",
      "To grow a small team to advocate for ETH.",
      "To fund new ETH initiatives."
    ],
    "scope": "The project's scope includes the development and maintenance of the open-source dashboard ethismoney.xyz, which tracks ETH's monetary functions. It also encompasses broader ETH advocacy and education efforts, including team growth and funding new initiatives. The project aims to expand the Ethereum ecosystem's public knowledge layer.",
    "problem_statement": "There is a need to clarify and strengthen the understanding of ETH's monetary properties and its role as core infrastructure within the Ethereum ecosystem. Existing dashboards often lack the specific focus on educational context and real-world adoption of ETH as a store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account."
  },
  "technical_analysis": {
    "methodology": "The technical approach involves building and maintaining an open-source dashboard (ethismoney.xyz) that surfaces on-chain data. This includes tracking ETH exports to L2s, institutional holdings, and issuance vs. burn rates. The methodology emphasizes transparent, reproducible visualizations and accessible educational context.",
    "innovation": "The primary innovation lies in the project's specific focus and differentiation: providing educational context alongside on-chain data to clarify ETH's monetary properties. While dashboards exist, the emphasis on ETH as a store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account, combined with accessible educational content, offers a unique value proposition.",
    "feasibility": "The project's core product, ethismoney.xyz, is already live and functional, demonstrating technical feasibility. The open-source nature and reliance on publicly available on-chain data further support its feasibility. Expanding with new graphs and features is a natural progression.",
    "technology_stack": [
      "On-chain data aggregation and processing (implied)",
      "Web development frameworks for dashboard (e.g., React, Vue, Angular - not specified)",
      "Data visualization libraries (e.g., D3.js, Chart.js - not specified)",
      "Version control (Git/GitHub)"

  "financial_analysis": {
    "budget_breakdown": "Grant funds are proposed to support contributors, design and development work for ethismoney.xyz, legal costs associated with Ether Guild's operation, and the general continued growth of Ether Guild as a hub for ETH advocacy and education.",
    "funding_sources": [
      "Gitcoin Grants (current application)"
    ],
    "financial_sustainability": "The application primarily focuses on the use of the current grant funds. A long-term financial sustainability plan beyond this grant is not explicitly detailed, though the mention of 'continued growth' implies ongoing funding needs. The non-profit status suggests reliance on donations, grants, and community support."
