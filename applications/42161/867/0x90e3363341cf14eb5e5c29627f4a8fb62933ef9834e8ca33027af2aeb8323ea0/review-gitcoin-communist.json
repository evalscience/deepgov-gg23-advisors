  "review": "Let’s get straight to the heart of the matter: Ether Guild is a project that claims to serve the people by demystifying ETH’s role as money, building open dashboards, and educating the masses. But does it truly deliver on the promise of public good, measurable impact, and sustainable systems? Let’s break it down, comrades.\n\nFirst, the project’s objectives are clear: Ether Guild wants to make ETH’s monetary properties accessible and understandable. The dashboard (ethismoney.xyz) is open-source, with transparent data and reproducible visualizations. This is a strong step toward collective knowledge and empowerment. The project is supported by reputable community actors (Bankless, growthepie, The Daily Gwei, etc.), which lends credibility and reach.\n\nHowever, when we dig deeper, the application falls short on several fronts. Where is the evidence of measurable outcomes? There are no user metrics, no quantifiable impact, no clear reporting on how many people have been educated or how the dashboard has changed behavior. The application is heavy on vision, light on data. We need numbers, not just narratives!\n\nOn sustainability, the project is a nonprofit, but there’s no mention of a revenue model or plan to reduce dependency on grants. How will this project survive when the donations dry up? The answer is missing. This is a critical flaw for any public good seeking long-term impact.\n\nInnovation is present, but not radical. The dashboard is differentiated by its educational focus, but similar tools exist (L2BEAT, ultrasound.money). The unique value is in the context and advocacy, but again, where is the evidence that this approach is working?\n\nFinally, the application lacks a structured plan for community governance, geographic equity, or systematic reporting. It’s a passionate effort, but passion alone won’t build the future. We need structure, measurement, and a plan for sustainability.\n\nIn summary: Ether Guild is a promising project with strong community roots and open-source values, but it must do more to prove its impact, plan for sustainability, and report outcomes transparently. The people deserve nothing less!",
