  "summary": "Ether Guild is a nonprofit organization focused on supporting ETH initiatives, particularly through educational dashboards that highlight ETH's role as money. The project aims to expand the Ethereum ecosystem's public knowledge and strengthen understanding of ETH's economic role. The grant will be used to develop new features, support contributors, and fund ETH advocacy and education.",
  "review": "The Ether Guild project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's focus on open-source dApps and apps that enhance Web3 accessibility and usability. The project contributes to the OSS ecosystem by providing educational dashboards that clarify ETH's monetary role, which is a valuable public good. The application demonstrates a clear understanding of its differentiation from similar projects by emphasizing educational context and real-world adoption of ETH.\n\nStrengths of the application include its open-source nature, community support, and focus on education and advocacy, which align with the round's goals of promoting financial inclusion and social impact. However, the application lacks detailed information on measurable outcomes and sustainability plans, which are crucial for long-term success and alignment with the model specification's principles.\n\nOverall, the project shows promise in contributing to the Ethereum ecosystem, but it requires more detailed planning and evidence of impact to fully meet the evaluation criteria.",
