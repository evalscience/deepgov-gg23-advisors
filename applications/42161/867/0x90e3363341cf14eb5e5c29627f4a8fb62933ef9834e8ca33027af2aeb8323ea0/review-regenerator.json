  "summary": "Ether Guild is a nonprofit organization focused on supporting ETH initiatives, particularly through educational dashboards that highlight ETH's role as money. The project aims to expand the Ethereum ecosystem's public knowledge and understanding of ETH's economic role. The grant will be used to develop new features, support contributors, and fund ETH advocacy and education initiatives.",
  "review": "The Ether Guild project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's focus on open-source dApps and apps that enhance Web3 accessibility and usability. The project contributes to the growth of the OSS ecosystem by providing educational resources and open-source visualizations that clarify ETH's role in the Ethereum economy. The emphasis on educational context and real-world adoption differentiates it from similar dashboards, such as L2BEAT and ultrasound.money. However, the application lacks detailed information on the project's impact metrics and sustainability plans, which are crucial for long-term success and alignment with the model specification's principles of innovation, community participation, and environmental sustainability.",
