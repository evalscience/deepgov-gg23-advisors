  "review": "Ether Guild, like a grove of young saplings reaching for the sun, seeks to nurture understanding and advocacy for ETH as money within the Ethereum ecosystem. The project’s open-source dashboard, ethismoney.xyz, is a public good—offering transparent, reproducible visualizations and educational context to clarify ETH’s economic role. This aligns with the round’s call for user-centric design, ecosystem growth, and innovation in application use cases.\n\nThe project’s roots are firmly planted in the open-source ethos, with a public GitHub repository and a commitment to community contributions. Its differentiation lies in its focus on educational context and real-world adoption, setting it apart from more technical or narrowly focused dashboards. The team’s plans to expand features, grow advocacy, and support new initiatives show a vision for long-term, systemic impact—much like a forest that grows stronger with each passing season.\n\nHowever, the application’s canopy is not without gaps. The user-centric design, while mentioned, is not deeply evidenced—there is little detail on how user feedback shapes the dashboard or how accessibility is ensured for diverse audiences. The innovation, though present in educational framing, could be more clearly articulated in terms of unique features or technical advancements. Furthermore, the application does not address environmental sustainability, a vital root in the soil of regenerative funding. There is also a lack of detail regarding community governance and how diverse voices are integrated into project direction.\n\nIn sum, Ether Guild is a promising sapling in the forest of open-source dApps, but to reach its full height, it must deepen its roots in user engagement, innovation, and holistic, regenerative values. I encourage the team to listen to the winds of community wisdom and to let their growth be guided by both sunlight and soil—by vision and by grounded, inclusive practice.",
