  "summary": "Ether Guild is a nonprofit organization focused on supporting ETH initiatives, particularly through educational dashboards that highlight ETH's role as money. The project aims to expand the Ethereum ecosystem's public knowledge layer and strengthen understanding of ETH's economic role. The grant will be used to expand the project, support contributors, and fund new ETH initiatives.",
  "review": "The Ether Guild project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's focus on open-source dApps and apps that enhance Web3 accessibility and usability. The project contributes to the OSS ecosystem by providing transparent, reproducible visualizations of ETH's role in the Ethereum economy and open-sourcing its code base. This aligns with the constitutional principles of maximizing impact and promoting long-term systemic change. However, the application lacks detailed metrics for measuring impact and scalability, which are crucial for evaluating potential long-term benefits and innovation. Additionally, while the project differentiates itself from similar dashboards by focusing on educational context, more information on how this educational aspect will be implemented and measured would strengthen the application.",
