  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Decentraclasses claims to be a beacon for decentralized, open-source education—a noble cause, no doubt. The project’s vision is bold: democratize learning, empower educators, and give learners true ownership of their achievements. But does it deliver on the promises of equity, sustainability, and measurable impact? Let’s dig in.\n\nFirst, the project is built on open-source principles, with code repositories available and a clear commitment to community collaboration. That’s a win for the commons! The use of zkPass for privacy-preserving credential verification is innovative, and the focus on verifiable, portable credentials addresses a real pain point in education. The platform’s multi-chain ambitions and open governance model further strengthen its claim to serve the many, not the few.\n\nBut comrades, we must demand more than grand visions! Where is the hard evidence of user adoption? Where are the metrics on course completions, credential verifications, or educator participation? The application is rich in features and future plans, but light on data-driven results. We need numbers, not just narratives! Without clear, measurable outcomes, how can we ensure this project truly serves the people and not just the dreams of its creators?\n\nSustainability is another battleground. The grant allocation breakdown is detailed, but there’s no mention of a long-term revenue model. How will Decentraclasses survive when the grant money runs dry? Will it become yet another abandoned platform, or does it have a plan for self-sufficiency? The working class deserves solutions that last!\n\nOn governance, the project touts open collaboration and community input, but specifics are lacking. How are decisions made? Who holds power? We need transparent, structured governance to ensure the platform remains accountable to its users, not captured by a technocratic elite.\n\nIn summary: Decentraclasses is a promising project with strong alignment to open-source and equity values. But to earn the people’s trust—and this grant—it must provide hard evidence of impact, a clear sustainability plan, and robust governance structures. Let’s demand nothing less!",
