  "summary": "The \"Have I Been Rekt?\" project, part of the Pretty Good OSINT Protocol (PGOP), aims to democratize access to open-source intelligence tools by providing a modular, privacy-respecting framework. It integrates AI automation, blockchain transparency, and privacy-preserving technologies to serve journalists, activists, researchers, and ethical hackers. The project emphasizes open-source principles, community involvement, and innovative use cases, aligning with the round's goals of enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability. However, the application could benefit from clearer details on community participation and environmental sustainability aspects.",
  "review": "The \"Have I Been Rekt?\" project presents a compelling case for funding within the GG23 OSS - dApps and Apps round. It aligns well with the round's objectives by offering a novel utility that enhances Web3 accessibility and usability. The project contributes to the open-source ecosystem by providing advanced OSINT tools that are typically restricted to government or corporate use, thus promoting financial inclusion and social impact. The application highlights several innovative features, such as AI-powered workflows, privacy-first design, and on-chain publishing, which demonstrate a strong commitment to innovation and transformation principles (Principles 5-8). The project's focus on privacy and decentralization aligns with the constitutional principles of community participation and innovation. However, the application lacks explicit details on how it incorporates community participation in decision-making processes (Principles 1-4) and does not address environmental sustainability principles (Principles 9-12). Additionally, while the project outlines its development roadmap and funding needs, it could provide more specific information on how it plans to measure and achieve its intended impact (Principles 13-20).",
