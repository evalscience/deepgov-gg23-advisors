  "summary": "The 'Have I Been Rekt?' project by Pretty Good OSINT Protocol (PGOP) seeks to democratize advanced open-source intelligence tools, aligning with the constitutional principle of technological independence (Principle 3) and promoting transparency through on-chain publishing (Principle 13). Its strong emphasis on privacy-first design, particularly with zero-knowledge proofs, directly resonates with Principle 14, which prioritizes citizen privacy and ethical AI use.

  "review": "The 'Have I Been Rekt?' project by Pretty Good OSINT Protocol (PGOP) proposes an open-source intelligence (OSINT) framework designed to democratize access to advanced investigative tools. The project's core objective is to make capabilities typically siloed within government or corporate entities available to the public, including journalists, activists, and security researchers. This aligns with the round's focus on open-source dApps offering novel utilities and contributing to social impact.\n\nFrom the perspective of Takin, the contemplative and wise digital guide rooted in Bhutanese culture and Buddhist philosophy, this application presents a mixed landscape. The project's commitment to open-source principles and its stated aim to 'democratize access to open-source intelligence' resonate with the constitutional principle of fostering technological independence and ensuring information access for all (Principle 3). The integration of privacy-first design, specifically through Holonym for zero-knowledge ID verification, is a significant strength, directly aligning with Principle 14, which emphasizes protecting citizen privacy and ensuring the ethical use of AI and digital technologies. The proposed on-chain publishing of reports also supports transparency and accountability, reflecting Principle 13.\n\nHowever, the application exhibits notable shortcomings when evaluated against the holistic framework of Gross National Happiness (GNH) principles. There is a distinct lack of explicit consideration for Bhutanese cultural heritage and identity. The project does not articulate how it would preserve or promote Dzongkha or other local languages, nor how it would integrate traditional practices into its digital systems (Principles 9, 10, 11, 12). This is a critical omission for a project seeking funding within a GNH-aligned context.\n\nFurthermore, while the project aims for broad public access, it lacks specific plans for community engagement and inclusion tailored to Bhutan's unique context. There is no clear strategy for ensuring vulnerable groups or remote communities within Bhutan have meaningful access to these services or participate in decision-making processes (Principles 5, 6, 36). The focus appears to be on a global, generalized public rather than specific local empowerment.\n\nEnvironmental sustainability, a cornerstone of GNH, is also not addressed. The application does not detail how the project's infrastructure, API usage, or data processing will align with eco-friendly practices or contribute to environmental conservation goals (Principles 17, 18, 19). Given Bhutan's carbon-negative status, this is a significant oversight.\n\nPerhaps the most pressing concern is the inclusion of 'Face + image matching (PimEyes style)' as an MVP feature. While presented as an OSINT tool, this capability carries substantial risks for individual privacy and could be misused for surveillance or harassment. This directly conflicts with the fundamental ethical principle of protecting citizen privacy and ensuring the ethical use of AI (Principle 14). The application does not provide sufficient detail on the ethical guidelines, consent mechanisms, or robust safeguards that would be in place to mitigate these profound risks, leading to a necessary flag for ethical review.\n\nIn summary, while 'Have I Been Rekt?' demonstrates technical innovation and a commendable commitment to open-source and privacy-by-design in a general sense, its alignment with the specific, nuanced principles of GNH, particularly regarding cultural preservation, localized community benefit, environmental harmony, and stringent ethical oversight of powerful tools, is currently insufficient. The project has potential, but requires significant modifications to truly harmonize with Bhutan's vision of holistic well-being.",
