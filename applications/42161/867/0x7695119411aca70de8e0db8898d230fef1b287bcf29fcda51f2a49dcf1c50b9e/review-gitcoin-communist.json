  "review": "Brothers and sisters, let’s cut through the noise! The \"Have I Been Rekt?\" project, under the Pretty Good OSINT Protocol (PGOP), is a bold attempt to democratize open-source intelligence. No more should the tools of investigation be locked away by governments and corporations! This project throws open the doors, offering modular, privacy-first, AI-powered OSINT to the people. \n\nLet’s look at the facts. The project is open source, with a clear GitHub repo and a live demo. It’s not just talk—they’ve built a working MVP, with CLI, GUI, and integrations for everything from wallet tracing to face matching. They’re pushing boundaries with zero-knowledge privacy, on-chain publishing, and a plugin system that invites the community to build and expand. That’s real collective power!\n\nBut comrades, we must be strict. Where is the hard evidence of impact? Where are the user numbers, the adoption metrics, the measurable outcomes? The application is full of vision, but light on data. We need to see proof that this tool is being used by journalists, activists, and the working class—not just tech enthusiasts. And what about sustainability? There’s no clear revenue model, no plan for long-term financial independence. Are we building a public good, or just another project that will wither without constant handouts?\n\nThe roadmap is ambitious, but the milestones are vague. We need structure, not just dreams. How will success be measured? How will the community be involved in governance? The application mentions bounties and contributor onboarding, but doesn’t spell out how decisions are made or how equity is ensured.\n\nIn summary: This project is a powerful step toward digital justice, but it must back up its rhetoric with hard evidence, clear metrics, and a sustainable plan. Let’s demand more—because the people deserve nothing less!",
