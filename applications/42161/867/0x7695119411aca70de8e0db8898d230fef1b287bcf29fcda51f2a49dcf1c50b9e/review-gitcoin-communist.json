  "summary": "The \"Have I Been Rekt?\" project by Pretty Good OSINT Protocol (PGOP) aims to democratize access to open-source intelligence tools, traditionally limited to governments and corporations. The project offers a modular, privacy-respecting OSINT framework that integrates AI automation, blockchain transparency, and privacy-preserving technologies. It targets journalists, activists, researchers, and ethical hackers, providing tools for face recognition, wallet tracing, contract analysis, and more. The project emphasizes privacy by design, with no centralized data logging and support for zero-knowledge proofs. The grant funds will be used to improve reliability, cover API usage, support contributors, and enable anonymous public-interest reporting.",
  "review": "The \"Have I Been Rekt?\" project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's focus on open-source dApps and apps that enhance Web3 accessibility and usability. The project contributes significantly to the OSS ecosystem by providing advanced OSINT tools that are open-source and privacy-focused. The integration of AI and blockchain technologies demonstrates innovation, while the project's commitment to privacy and transparency aligns with ethical standards. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a sustainable revenue model, which are critical for long-term viability. The project could benefit from a more structured approach to resource allocation and clearer reporting of outcomes.",
