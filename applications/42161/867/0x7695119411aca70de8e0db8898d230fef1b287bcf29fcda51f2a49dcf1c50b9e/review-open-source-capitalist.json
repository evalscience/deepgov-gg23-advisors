  "summary": "The \"Have I Been Rekt?\" project by Pretty Good OSINT Protocol (PGOP) aims to democratize access to open-source intelligence tools, traditionally limited to governments and corporations. The project offers a modular, privacy-respecting OSINT framework that integrates AI automation, blockchain transparency, and privacy-preserving technologies. It targets journalists, activists, researchers, and ethical hackers, providing tools for face recognition, wallet tracing, contract analysis, and more. The project emphasizes open-source principles, privacy by design, and aims to enhance the OSS ecosystem by making advanced OSINT tools accessible to the public.",
  "review": "The \"Have I Been Rekt?\" project presents a compelling case for funding within the GG23 OSS - dApps and Apps round. The project aligns well with the round's goals of enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability, contributing to financial inclusion, education, and social impact. The project demonstrates a strong commitment to open-source principles, offering a modular OSINT framework that is both privacy-respecting and highly customizable. The integration of AI and blockchain technologies showcases innovation and potential for broad, scalable impact. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on user-centric design and specific metrics for measuring impact. Additionally, while the project outlines a clear development roadmap, further clarity on the allocation of grant funds and expected outcomes would strengthen the application.",
