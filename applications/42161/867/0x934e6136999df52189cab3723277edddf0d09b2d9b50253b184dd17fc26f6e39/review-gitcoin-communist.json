  "summary": "The SONGS project aims to revolutionize the music industry by providing an open-source protocol for on-chain music distribution and monetization. It offers innovative solutions like WrappedSongs and SongShares, which tokenize music royalties and enable fractional ownership. The project emphasizes transparency, community growth, and integration with existing open-source projects, contributing significantly to the Web3 ecosystem.",
  "review": "The SONGS project presents a compelling case for transforming the music industry through blockchain technology. It addresses key issues such as the lack of digital standards for tracks, opaque royalty flows, and limited liquidity for artists. By offering solutions like WrappedSongs and SongShares, the project not only enhances transparency but also democratizes access to music investments. The project's focus on open-source principles and community engagement aligns well with the round's eligibility criteria, particularly in terms of contributing to Web3 ecosystem growth and presenting innovative use cases. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on measurable outcomes and sustainability plans to align with the model specification's emphasis on evidence and sustainability principles.",
