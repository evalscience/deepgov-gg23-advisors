  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! SONGS claims to be the next-generation layer for the music industry, promising to tear down the walls of opaque intermediaries and put power back in the hands of artists and fans. The vision is bold: open-source standards for music, transparent royalty flows, and a protocol that lets anyone invest in the future of music. But does this project deliver on the values we hold dear—measurable impact, sustainability, and collective benefit?\n\nFirst, the project is open source and provides a public GitHub, which is a non-negotiable foundation. The application details concrete primitives (WrappedSongs, SongShares), a developer SDK, and composable contracts. These are not just buzzwords—they’re the building blocks of a real, reusable public good. The claim that 96% of users are new to crypto is a powerful testament to onboarding and accessibility, directly addressing the round’s call for Web3 adoption and social impact.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by grand promises! Where is the hard data? Where are the metrics on user retention, transaction volume, or the number of artists meaningfully benefiting? The application is rich in vision but thin on evidence. We need to see quantifiable outcomes, not just potential. The roadmap is ambitious, but the sustainability of the revenue model is not clearly articulated. Will this protocol stand on its own, or will it be forever dependent on grants and donations?\n\nThe governance structure is also unclear. Who decides the direction of the protocol? How are community voices heard and balanced with expert guidance? Without strong, transparent governance, even the best technology can be co-opted by private interests.\n\nIn summary: SONGS is a promising, innovative project with a clear commitment to open source and collective benefit. But to earn the trust—and the resources—of the people, it must provide hard evidence, a sustainable plan, and a clear governance model. Let’s demand more than dreams. Let’s demand results!",
