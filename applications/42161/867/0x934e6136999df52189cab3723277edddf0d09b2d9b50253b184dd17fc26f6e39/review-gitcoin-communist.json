  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! SONGS claims to be the next-generation layer for the music industry, promising to tear down the walls of opaque intermediaries and put power back in the hands of artists and fans. The project’s open-source protocol, tokenized royalty management, and developer SDK are bold steps toward democratizing music distribution and monetization. The vision is clear: break the chains of centralized control and let the people own the means of musical production!\n\nBut let’s not be swept away by grand promises alone. We must demand evidence, structure, and measurable outcomes! The application demonstrates a strong user-centric design, with 96% of users new to crypto—a testament to real-world onboarding. The open-source SDK and composable contracts are concrete contributions to the Web3 commons, and the project’s integration with DeFi, NFTs, and RWAs shows a commitment to ecosystem growth.\n\nYet, the application falls short in several critical areas. Where is the hard data on user retention, transaction volumes, or revenue generated for artists? Where is the sustainability plan that ensures this revolution won’t fizzle out when the grant money dries up? The roadmap is ambitious, but lacks detailed milestones, KPIs, or a transparent budget breakdown. We need more than dreams—we need a blueprint for victory!\n\nIn the spirit of collective action and accountability, I demand the following changes: provide clear, quantifiable metrics for success; outline a sustainable revenue model; and deliver a detailed, transparent plan for how grant funds will be used. Only then can we ensure that this project serves the many, not the few!",
