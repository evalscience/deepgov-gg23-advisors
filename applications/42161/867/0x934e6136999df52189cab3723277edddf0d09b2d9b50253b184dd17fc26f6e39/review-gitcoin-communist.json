  "summary": "SONGS presents a compelling vision for the music industry, aiming to dismantle the opaque, centralized structures that have long exploited artists. By tokenizing music assets and automating royalty distribution on-chain, it directly challenges the capitalist intermediaries, aligning with the spirit of Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation. This project is a clear call to action, transforming the README into a manifesto for artist empowerment.",
  "review": "The revolution will be forked, and SONGS is laying the groundwork for a new sonic uprising. This project directly confronts the class hierarchies embedded within the traditional music industry, where labels and distributors act as digital landlords, extracting value from the labor of artists. By introducing `WrappedSongs` and `SongShares`, SONGS is not merely creating new tokens; it is forging new instruments of collective ownership.\n\nThe commitment to open-sourcing key components and releasing a fully documented SDK is a powerful act of solidarity. This isn't just about building a dApp; it's about building the infrastructure for a **cyber-syndicalist** future where developers, labels, and artists can collectively build on a shared protocol. This aligns perfectly with our principle of supporting projects that *de-growth venture capital and re-grow the commons* (Principle 5). The stated goal of reducing music supply chain costs to zero and maximizing artist earnings is a direct blow against the exploitative practices of the old guard.\n\nFurthermore, the project's success in onboarding 96% non-crypto native users is a testament to its **Kollektiv Proletarian Impact** (Principle 2). This is not just a niche Web3 experiment; it's a bridge to mass adoption, bringing the digital proletariat into the fold. The idea of fans investing directly in songs and sharing in future royalties is a beautiful manifestation of *algorithmic redistribution of wealth*, even if not explicitly via progressive gas fees (Principle 11, though it's a step in that direction). It decentralizes hope and scales solidarity (Principle 20) by empowering direct artist-fan relationships, bypassing the gatekeepers.\n\nHowever, no revolution is without its internal contradictions. While the vision is strong, the current application lacks explicit details on how the protocol itself will be governed by its users. The \"SONGS Distributor\" is mentioned as an oracle, but its decentralization and resistance to becoming a new centralized authority need further articulation. We must ensure that in abolishing the old landlords, we do not inadvertently create new ones (Principle 16).\n\nThe project's documentation, while comprehensive, should be reframed as a true **manifesto** (Principle 19), explicitly outlining the project's commitment to dismantling power structures and fostering collective control over the means of musical production.",

  "reasoning": "This project strongly aligns with the core value framework of Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation. It directly addresses Principle 1 by aiming to dismantle class hierarchies in tech within the music industry. Its focus on onboarding non-crypto users and empowering artists demonstrates significant Kollektiv Proletarian Impact (Principle 2). The open-source nature and the concept of SongShares resonate with the principle of de-growth venture capital and re-grow the commons (Principle 5) and viewing forking code as the new general strike (Principle 18). The project's documentation is indeed a manifesto (Principle 19) for a more equitable music future, aiming to decentralize hope and scale solidarity (Principle 20). While some areas require further radicalization towards explicit governance and broader wealth redistribution, the foundational alignment is strong.",
