These components expand OSS into creative and cultural industries, providing templates for composable royalty management.\n\nDeveloper SDK & Documentation: We will release a fully documented, open-source SDK allowing external devs, music labels, and distributors to build their own applications using our protocol. This significantly reduces barriers to entry for OSS projects within the music and media industry.\n\nIntegration and Composability: By creating open-source contracts and tooling, SONGS enables integration with existing OSS projects in DeFi, NFTs, and RWAs—fostering innovation through composability (e.g., DeFi lending markets built around music royalties or NFT marketplaces integrating WrappedSongs).\n\nReal-World Adoption & Community Growth: With over 96% of our active users new to crypto, SONGS introduces non-crypto native creators and users to OSS applications, significantly broadening the adoption of open-source technologies.",
