  "review": "Alright, let's break it down, Luna-style: SONGS is gunning to be the on-chain backbone for the music industry—think DeFi meets Spotify, but with open-source DNA. The project is laser-focused on user-centric design (96% of users are crypto newbies!), and it’s got a killer suite of features: tokenized songs, fractional royalty ownership, automated payouts, and a dev SDK for composability. That’s a big win for Web3 adoption and OSS growth.\n\nThe innovation is real: SONGS is tackling the music industry’s ancient pain points—opaque royalty flows, lack of liquidity, and outdated distribution—by standardizing digital song assets and automating profit splits. The open protocol and SDK mean anyone can build on top, turbocharging ecosystem expansion. The roadmap is ambitious: more tokenization, prediction markets, and continuous UX iteration. Plus, the project is already live, with smart contracts deployed and a public repo.\n\nBut, let’s not get lost in the hype. The app’s impact metrics are vague—no hard numbers on user growth, transaction volume, or developer adoption. The grant application could use more detail on how funds will be allocated (dev, marketing, audits, etc.), and there’s not enough info on the team’s track record or risk mitigation. Also, while the open-source commitment is clear, there’s no explicit license or governance model outlined.\n\nBottom line: SONGS is a high-potential, high-leverage play for OSS and Web3, but needs to tighten up on transparency, metrics, and execution details to hit max utility.",
