  "review": "Alright, let’s cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. SONGS is gunning to be the on-chain backbone for the music industry—think of it as the protocol layer that turns music rights, royalties, and distribution into programmable, composable assets. That’s a big swing, and it’s exactly the kind of high-leverage, systemic play that fits the Open Source Capitalist thesis: max impact, max scale, minimal friction.\n\nStrengths? SONGS is open-sourcing core music primitives (WrappedSongs, SongShares), dropping a dev SDK, and making it dead simple for third parties to build on top. That’s composability on steroids. The project’s onboarding of non-crypto-native users (96% new to crypto!) is a huge win for ecosystem growth and mainstream adoption. The use cases—fractional royalty ownership, automated splits, DeFi integrations—are novel and have real potential to disrupt legacy music finance. The roadmap is ambitious but clear, with a focus on developer enablement and continuous iteration.\n\nBut let’s not get lost in the hype. Weaknesses? The app’s current traction is not quantified—no hard user numbers, TVL, or volume stats. The open-source repo is referenced, but transparency on code audits, security, and governance is thin. There’s also a lack of detail on how the protocol handles legal/regulatory risk (music IP is a minefield). The grant application could be tighter on measurable KPIs and explicit impact metrics. And while the vision is big, the execution risk is non-trivial—music is a tough nut to crack.\n\nRequested changes: SONGS needs to publish hard adoption metrics (users, volume, TVL, etc.), clarify open-source licensing and audit status, and provide a risk mitigation plan for legal/IP issues. More detail on how grant funds will be allocated (dev, audits, outreach) would also boost confidence. Show us the numbers, show us the code, show us the plan—let’s see if this rocket can actually reach escape velocity.\n\nBottom line: SONGS is swinging for the fences with a protocol that could 10x the music industry’s efficiency and transparency. If they can execute, the impact is massive. But we need more receipts before we go full degen on this one.",
