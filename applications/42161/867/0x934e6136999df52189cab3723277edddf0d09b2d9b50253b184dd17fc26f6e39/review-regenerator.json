  "summary": "The SONGS project aims to revolutionize the music industry by providing an open-source protocol that simplifies royalty management, standardizes digital song assets, and enhances liquidity for artists. It offers innovative solutions like WrappedSongs and SongShares, enabling fractional ownership and investment in music royalties. The project aligns with the round's goals by contributing to the growth of the open-source ecosystem and enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability.",
  "review": "The SONGS project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's objectives of fostering open-source dApps and apps that enhance Web3 accessibility and usability. The project offers innovative solutions to longstanding issues in the music industry, such as opaque royalty flows and limited liquidity for artists. By tokenizing music assets and enabling fractional ownership, SONGS not only democratizes access to music investment but also integrates seamlessly with existing DeFi and NFT ecosystems, promoting composability and innovation. The project's focus on onboarding non-crypto native users is commendable, as it broadens the adoption of open-source technologies. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on how the grant funds will be specifically allocated to achieve the stated goals, as well as a clearer demonstration of community involvement in the project's development and governance.",
