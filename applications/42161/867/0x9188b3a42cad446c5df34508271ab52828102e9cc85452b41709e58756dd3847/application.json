        "description": "Compensation empowering Collaboration\n\nCollabberry was born out of the Fellowship program of RnDAO and Arbitrum, where we did an extensive research on the problem-space of Compensation in early stage teams. More info about the program here : https://www.rndao.io/colab/fellowship\n\nCompensation in centralized organizations is tricky, and even trickier in decentralized ones, embracing collaboration. \n\nTo achieve a collaborative environment, we need to align incentives in the team. Web3 has been exploring that since its beginning and yet, we still don't have a tool that covers the needs of an early-stage team. \n\nEarly-stage teams struggle to maximize their runway while attracting talent and building a strong team to deliver on a common goal. \n\nContributors seek recognition and rewards (oftentimes in ownership) according to their contributions to the project. Contributors are often frustrated with the lack of financial distribution and ownership and they feel discomfort negotiating their salaries. Furthermore, compensation based on negotiation, often results in unfairness, as not everyone has the skill set to do that.\n\nThe founders, on the other hand,  struggle to form the team as they are not in a place to give competitive salaries.\n\nThe solution requires to be:\n* leveraging transparency in compensation for fostering trust and equality\n* harnessing collective intelligence through peer-to-peer assessment\n* implementing a concept of Basic Income for meeting contributors' needs\n* embracing co-ownership to align incentives\n* leveraging Web3 technology for enhanced trust and fairness\n\nThis is how we designed Collabberry. \n\nCollabberry leverages peer-to-peer assessment and dynamic ownership to create fair, transparent, and efficient compensation models for startups and early-stage projects.\n\nCollabberry simplifies collaboration with three key steps: agreement setup, peer-to-peer assessment, and dynamic compensation, split between Team Points for tracking ownership and monetary compensation, ensuring that the contributor's basic needs are covered.\n\nThis innovative approach makes Collabberry an essential tool for equitable teamwork.\n\nAdditional Resources: \n\nRead the paper here: \nhttps://mirror.xyz/migrenaa.eth/RwxcpsCkoeKITWNNadpVqwgcBW2hVr-xQIK2p7AATD8\n\nRead about the initiation of Collabberry here:\nhttps://mirror.xyz/migrenaa.eth/RwxcpsCkoeKITWNNadpVqwgcBW2hVr-xQIK2p7AATD8\n\nRecently we ran an extensive user test with RnDAO's team, read our findings here: \nhttps://mirror.xyz/0xbE5Fc9e8F3AD6EA0bD0562C59De70B5cc723C9d3/sBLwIJXMjYRNzJ6PYwjyTg9sIFvDsJNWWwkYXvHwGYM\n\n",

      "description": "## 🌱 **CollabBerry: Compensation Empowering Collaboration**\n\nThe future of work demands a new paradigm.\n\nTraditional compensation is broken—designed for hierarchies, not for the dynamic, creative energy of early-stage teams. In DAOs and Web3 projects, contributors crave clarity, fairness, and recognition—but what they often get is ambiguity, negotiation anxiety, and imbalance.\n\nAt CollabBerry, we believe work should be **owned**, not just paid for.\n\nThat’s why we built a protocol and a platform that lets people co-create value, earn based on real contributions, and grow together—with **transparency, equity, and trust** at the core.\n\n---\n\n### 🚀 What We Built\n\nOver the past year—originating from the RnDAO x Arbitrum Fellowship—we launched [**CollabBerry Beta**](https://beta.collabberry.xyz/): a Web3-native platform for dynamic, fair compensation in early-stage teams.\n\nOur protocol flows through 3 core steps:\n\n1. **🛠 Agreement Setting**\n    \n    Clear contributor/org agreements (time, role, expectations, $USD value).\n    \n2. **📊 Assessment in P2P fashion**\n    \n    Contributors assess each other’s impact, creating a community-driven performance layer.\n    \n3. **🔢 Accounting through Dynamic Compensation**\n    \n    Contributions are compensated in **stableCoins + TeamPoints** (ownership shares), based on real, peer-attributed value.\n    \n\nBehind it: the **CollabBerry AAA Protocol**, blending simplicity, accountability, and equity.\n\n---\n\n### 📈 Real-World Impact (till April 2nd)\n\nSince launching our beta:\n\n- **32 early-stage orgs onboarded**\n- **100+ contributors actively collaborating**\n- **$300,000+ in attributed contribution value** (USD equivalent)\n- **Transparent ownership sharing** powered by TeamPoints\n- **Contributors empowered** to define, commit to, and assess their roles—together\n\nThis isn't just a product—it's a cultural shift. CollabBerry is **formalizing sweat equity** in a way that’s practical, fair, and scalable.\n\n---\n\n### ✨ Our Vision\n\nWe imagine a world where:\n\n- **Ownership is earned, not granted arbitrarily**\n- **Teams collaborate without corporate BS or negotiation anxiety**\n- **AI & Web3 enable radical clarity, fairness, and trust**\n- **Economic models center real contribution—not hierarchy or politics**\n\nAs we grow, we're building toward **market-based ownership pricing**, dynamic equity pools, and reputation-informed profit sharing.\n\n**Our north star?** A transparent, collaborative economy rooted in contribution—not just capital.\n\n---\n\n### 🌸 Our Culture\n\nCollabBerry is a **movement** as much as it is a protocol.\n\nWe live by values like:\n\n- Transparency > politics\n- Ownership > titles\n- Collaboration > competition\n- Fairness > negotiation skill\n- Authenticity > corporate fluff\n\nWe’re designing for *people*, not personas. For co-creation, not contracts. For a post-capitalist future where **shared value means shared ownership**.\n\nExplore our full cultural manifesto here (you can also join our CommonGround community:\n\n📜 https://app.cg/c/HSZL0tsGw9/article/collabberry-cultural-manifiesto-qTx3cDbHBaEVeudsjZNR4Q/ \n\n---\n\n### 🤝 Why Support Us?\n\nYour support helps us:\n\n- Improve the protocol & experience for contributors worldwide\n- Onboard more teams into equitable collaboration\n- Build new features: arbitration, pricing markets, AI-powered agreement flows\n- Continue pioneering post-capitalist, co-ownership work systems\n\nWe're here to create the rails for a new kind of work—where people don’t just survive, they **co-own** what they build.\n\n**Join us. Let’s make collaboration fair—together.**\n\n🍓 [beta.collabberry.xyz](https://beta.collabberry.xyz/)",
