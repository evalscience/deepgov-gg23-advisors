  "summary": "Collabberry is an open-source tool designed to address compensation challenges in early-stage teams, particularly within decentralized organizations. The project aims to create a fair and transparent compensation model through peer-to-peer assessments and dynamic ownership. The grant will fund the development of an AI-powered Agreements Agent to enhance the tool's functionality. Collabberry aligns with the round's goals by contributing to the growth of the Web3 ecosystem and offering innovative solutions for financial inclusion and social impact.",
  "review": "The Collabberry project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's objectives of enhancing the Web3 ecosystem through innovative dApps. The project addresses a significant challenge in decentralized organizations: fair compensation. By leveraging peer-to-peer assessments and dynamic ownership, Collabberry offers a novel approach to compensation that aligns with the constitutional principles of innovation and community participation. The proposed AI-powered Agreements Agent further enhances the project's potential impact by addressing a key friction point in early-stage collaboration. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the project's environmental sustainability practices and a clearer demonstration of user-centric design.",
