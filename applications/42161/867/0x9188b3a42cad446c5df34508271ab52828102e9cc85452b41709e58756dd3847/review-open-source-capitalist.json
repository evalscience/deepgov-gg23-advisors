  "summary": "Collabberry is an open-source tool designed to address compensation challenges in early-stage teams, particularly within decentralized organizations. The project aims to create a fair and transparent compensation model through peer-to-peer assessments and dynamic ownership. The grant will fund the development of an AI-powered Agreements Agent to enhance the tool's functionality. The project aligns with the round's goals by contributing to the growth of the Web3 ecosystem and offering innovative solutions for financial inclusion and social impact.",
  "review": "Collabberry presents a compelling case for funding by addressing a significant gap in the compensation models for early-stage teams, especially in decentralized environments. The project leverages Web3 technology to create a transparent and equitable compensation system, which is a critical need in the current ecosystem. The proposed AI-powered Agreements Agent is an innovative feature that could significantly enhance the tool's utility and user experience. The application demonstrates a clear understanding of the challenges faced by early-stage teams and offers a practical solution that aligns with the round's objectives of enhancing Web3 accessibility and usability. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the implementation plan and metrics for success. Additionally, while the project has shown initial success, further evidence of scalability and long-term impact would strengthen the application.",
