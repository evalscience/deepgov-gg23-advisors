  "summary": "Stereum is an open-source Ethereum Node Installer & Manager designed to simplify the process of setting up and managing Ethereum nodes. The project aims to make node operation accessible to a broader audience, thereby contributing to the decentralization and security of the Ethereum network. With over 40,000 downloads and significant community engagement, Stereum has demonstrated its impact on the Ethereum ecosystem. The project plans to use grant funds to further enhance its features, including integrating Layer 2 networks and developing a Data Access Management Hub.",
  "review": "The Stereum project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure. The application highlights significant contributions to the Ethereum network, such as enabling over 45,000 Ethereum mainnet validators and simplifying node operation for non-technical users. The project's open-source nature and community-driven approach further enhance its alignment with Gitcoin's values. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on its sustainability model and specific metrics for measuring success. Additionally, while the project has a strong community focus, it should provide more evidence of its governance structures and how it plans to ensure long-term sustainability beyond grant funding.",
