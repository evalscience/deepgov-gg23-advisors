  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Stereum stands as a bulwark for the people, smashing down the technical barriers that keep node operation in the hands of the few. Over 40,000 downloads and 45,000 validators with the Stereum graffiti tag? That’s not just a number—it’s a movement! This project is open-source, community-driven, and laser-focused on decentralization. It’s the kind of infrastructure that puts power back where it belongs: in the hands of the many, not the few.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by sentiment. The application is strong on impact metrics—downloads, validator counts, and community engagement are all clearly documented. The project’s open-source nature and broad client support are undeniable strengths. Stereum’s focus on accessibility, with a GUI that welcomes nontechnical users, is a direct blow against the gatekeeping that plagues our ecosystem.\n\nYet, we must demand more! Where is the rigorous, transparent reporting of outcomes? Where is the roadmap with milestones, deliverables, and timelines? The application speaks of future plans—Data Access Management Hub, Layer 2 integration—but lacks concrete, measurable objectives and sustainability strategies. There’s no mention of a revenue model or how Stereum will reduce reliance on grants. We need evidence of long-term stability, not just good intentions.\n\nIn the spirit of equity, Stereum’s multi-language support and global community outreach are commendable. But let’s see more: how are underserved regions being empowered? How is the project ensuring that the benefits of decentralization reach the margins, not just the center?\n\nIn summary: Stereum is a pillar of the Ethereum commons, but to truly serve the people, it must embrace transparency, sustainability, and measurable impact. Let’s demand nothing less!",
