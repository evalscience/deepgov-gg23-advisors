  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Stereum stands as a bulwark for the Ethereum network, smashing down the technical barriers that keep ordinary people from running their own nodes. Over 40,000 downloads and 45,000 validators using Stereum graffiti? That’s not just a number—it’s a movement! This is the kind of collective action that decentralizes power and puts the tools of sovereignty in the hands of the many, not the few.\n\nStereum’s open-source, GUI-based approach is a direct strike against the elitism of command-line gatekeeping. By making node operation accessible to nontechnical users, Stereum is not just talking about equity—it’s building it, one node at a time. The project’s commitment to security, client diversity, and robust community support is exactly what the Ethereum commons needs to thrive.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by sentiment! The application is strong on impact and reach, but it falls short on rigorous, quantifiable outcome measurement. Where are the clear metrics for decentralization impact? Where’s the transparent reporting on how grant funds will be used, and what measurable milestones will be achieved? The roadmap is promising, but it needs more structure and accountability. And while Stereum’s community support is commendable, there’s little evidence of a sustainable revenue model that would reduce reliance on continuous grants.\n\nWe must demand more! The revolution is not won with good intentions alone. We need hard evidence, transparent reporting, and a plan for long-term sustainability. Stereum is a powerful force for the public good, but to earn the people’s resources, it must show us the numbers, the milestones, and the path to self-sufficiency. Only then can we ensure that the Ethereum infrastructure serves all, not just the privileged few!",
