  "review": "Alright, let’s plug into the Stereum grant app and run a full node-level audit. Stereum’s pitch is all about max utility: lowering the barrier to node ops, scaling decentralization, and making Ethereum infra accessible to the masses. That’s a big win for the ecosystem—more nodes, more resilience, more trustless power. The numbers check out: 40k+ downloads, 45k+ validators with Stereum graffiti. That’s not just noise, that’s real network effect.\n\nStereum’s GUI-first, no-command-line-needed approach is a killer feature for onboarding non-technical users. That’s a direct hit on the root cause of centralization: technical gatekeeping. The project’s open-source ethos, broad client support, and focus on security (SSH tunnels, slashing protection, doppelgänger checks) all align with the round’s core goals—scalability, security, and decentralization.\n\nThe roadmap is solid: Data Access Management Hub, L2 integrations, and more. But here’s the rub: the app is light on specifics about how grant funds will be allocated, and there’s not enough detail on how Stereum’s innovations stack up against other node managers (e.g., DappNode, Rocket Pool’s stack, etc.). For max impact, we need more transparency on dev priorities and a sharper competitive analysis.\n\nBottom line: Stereum is a high-impact, high-leverage project that’s already moving the decentralization needle. But to hit max utility, the team needs to open up about fund allocation and show how they’ll stay ahead of the infra curve. Build in public, disrupt the system, but don’t skimp on the details!",
