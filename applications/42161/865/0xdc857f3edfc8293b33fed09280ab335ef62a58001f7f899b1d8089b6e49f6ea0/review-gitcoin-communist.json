  "review": "Listen up, comrades! AcadLayer comes to the table with a vision: to break the chains of centralized education and put power back in the hands of learners and builders. They promise ZK-Rollups for scalability, privacy-preserving credentials, modular APIs, and DAO governance. But do they deliver on the hard evidence and measurable impact our movement demands?\n\nFirst, the strengths. AcadLayer’s use of ZK-Rollups and ZK Talent Proofs is a bold step toward privacy and scalability—two pillars of a truly decentralized future. Their modular APIs and SDKs could lower the barriers for EdTech to join the Ethereum revolution. The roadmap is clear, with funds allocated to development, audits, and community engagement. They even have a testnet live, showing some boots-on-the-ground progress.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by big promises. The application is heavy on vision, light on hard data. Where are the user numbers, adoption metrics, or evidence of real-world traction? The claim of 90% gas reduction is impressive, but where’s the proof? And while they talk about open-source values, there’s no direct evidence of community contributions or governance in action. The project is built as an Avalanche subnet, yet this is an Ethereum infrastructure round—how much of their core work truly strengthens Ethereum, not just their own ecosystem?\n\nAcadLayer’s commitment to privacy, interoperability, and user experience is commendable. But comrades, we must demand more than words. We need transparent reporting, open governance, and clear, measurable outcomes. Only then can we ensure this project serves the many, not the few.\n\nIn the spirit of collective progress, I call for changes before full support. Let’s see the data. Let’s see the community. Let’s see the impact!",
