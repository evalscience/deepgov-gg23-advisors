  "summary": "AcadLayer is a decentralized education protocol leveraging Layer 2 ZK-Rollup technology to enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs on Ethereum. It introduces ZK Talent Proofs for privacy-preserving credential verification, modular APIs and SDKs for dApp integration, and on-chain educational games to boost engagement. The project aims to contribute significantly to the Ethereum network by improving scalability, privacy, and user experience, while also addressing issues like high gas fees and fragmented identity systems.",
  "review": "The AcadLayer project presents a comprehensive approach to enhancing the Ethereum ecosystem through innovative solutions like ZK-Rollups and ZK Talent Proofs. The project's focus on reducing transaction costs and increasing throughput aligns well with the round's goal of strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure. The use of ZK-SNARKs for privacy-preserving credential verification is a notable strength, contributing to both privacy and security within the network. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a clear sustainability model, which are crucial for long-term impact and alignment with the model specification's principles. The roadmap is well-structured, but the application could benefit from more specific metrics and evidence of past success to support its claims.",
