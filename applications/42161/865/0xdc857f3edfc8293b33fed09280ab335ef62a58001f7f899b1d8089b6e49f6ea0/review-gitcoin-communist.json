  "review": "Brothers and sisters, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! AcadLayer claims to be building a decentralized education protocol leveraging ZK-Rollups, privacy-preserving credentials, modular APIs, and DAO governance. The rhetoric is strong, but does it stand up to the fierce scrutiny of our collective values and the hard demands of evidence?\n\nFirst, the project’s ambition is clear: reduce gas fees, boost throughput, and bring privacy to on-chain credentials. They tout up to 90% reduction in transaction costs and thousands of TPS for educational dApps. But where is the hard data? Where are the public dashboards, the testnet stats, the user adoption numbers? We demand proof, not just promises!\n\nAcadLayer’s focus on privacy, interoperability, and user experience is commendable. ZK Talent Proofs and decentralized identity are the right direction for a fairer, more inclusive Ethereum. Yet, the application is light on rigorous, transparent reporting. There’s no mention of how outcomes will be measured, how impact will be tracked, or how the community will hold them accountable.\n\nThe roadmap is structured, with clear phases and allocation of funds. But what about sustainability? There’s no mention of a revenue model or how the project will survive without perpetual grants. We must not build castles on sand!\n\nDAO governance and community involvement are highlighted, but the application lacks detail on how these structures will ensure true equity and expert guidance. How will underserved communities be reached? How will decisions be made and reported?\n\nIn summary: AcadLayer is bold, ambitious, and aligned with the spirit of public goods. But it must do more to earn the trust and resources of the people. Show us the evidence! Show us the plan for sustainability! Show us the metrics and the mechanisms for real, collective impact! Only then can we march forward together, confident that this is a project for the many, not the few.",
