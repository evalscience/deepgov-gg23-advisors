  "summary": "AcadLayer is a decentralized education protocol leveraging Layer 2 ZK-Rollup technology to enhance scalability and privacy in educational applications on Ethereum. It introduces ZK Talent Proofs for verifiable credentials, modular APIs and SDKs for dApp integration, and on-chain educational games. The project aims to reduce transaction costs, improve throughput, and enhance user privacy and control over personal data. It also incorporates DAO governance for community involvement.",
  "review": "The AcadLayer project presents a comprehensive approach to addressing several key challenges within the Ethereum ecosystem, particularly focusing on scalability, privacy, and user engagement. By utilizing ZK-Rollups, the project effectively reduces transaction costs and increases throughput, which is crucial for the scalability of educational dApps. The introduction of ZK Talent Proofs is a significant innovation, providing privacy-preserving credential verification, which enhances user trust and data security. The project's emphasis on modular APIs and SDKs facilitates seamless integration for developers, promoting wider adoption of Ethereum in the educational sector. Additionally, the incorporation of DAO governance aligns with community participation principles, allowing stakeholders to have a say in decision-making processes. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics and evidence of past success to strengthen its case for funding.",
