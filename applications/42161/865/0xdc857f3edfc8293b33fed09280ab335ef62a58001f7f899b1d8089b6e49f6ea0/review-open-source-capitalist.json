  "summary": "AcadLayer is a decentralized education protocol leveraging Layer 2 ZK-Rollup technology to enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs on Ethereum. It introduces ZK Talent Proofs for privacy-preserving credential verification, modular APIs and SDKs for dApp integration, and on-chain educational games to boost engagement. The project aims to contribute significantly to the Ethereum network by improving scalability, privacy, and user experience, while also addressing issues like high gas fees and fragmented identity systems.",
  "review": "AcadLayer presents a compelling case for enhancing the Ethereum ecosystem through its innovative use of ZK-Rollups and privacy-preserving technologies. The project addresses key challenges such as high gas fees and privacy concerns in credential verification, offering solutions that align with the round's focus on scalability and security. The introduction of ZK Talent Proofs and decentralized identity systems demonstrates a commitment to pioneering development, particularly in enhancing privacy and interoperability. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics and examples of past successes to strengthen its claims of impact and scalability.",
