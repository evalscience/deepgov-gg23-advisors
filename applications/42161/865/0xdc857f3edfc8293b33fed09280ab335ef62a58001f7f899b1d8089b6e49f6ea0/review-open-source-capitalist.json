  "summary": "AcadLayer is a decentralized education protocol leveraging Layer 2 ZK-Rollup technology to enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs on Ethereum. It introduces ZK Talent Proofs for privacy-preserving credential verification, modular APIs and SDKs for dApp integration, and on-chain educational games to boost engagement. The project aims to address high gas fees, lack of privacy in credentials, fragmented identity systems, and complex Web2 to Web3 integration. The roadmap includes core development and platform expansion phases, with a focus on smart contract development, security audits, and community engagement.",
  "review": "AcadLayer presents a compelling case for enhancing the Ethereum ecosystem through its focus on scalability, privacy, and user engagement. The use of ZK-Rollups to reduce transaction costs and increase throughput is a significant strength, aligning with the round's focus on scalability and security. The introduction of ZK Talent Proofs addresses privacy concerns in credential verification, a notable innovation in the Ethereum space. The project's modular APIs and SDKs facilitate integration, supporting the Ethereum network's infrastructure expansion. However, the application lacks detailed metrics and evidence of past success, which are crucial for assessing potential impact. Additionally, while the project outlines a clear roadmap, it could benefit from more specific milestones and timelines to enhance accountability and transparency.",
