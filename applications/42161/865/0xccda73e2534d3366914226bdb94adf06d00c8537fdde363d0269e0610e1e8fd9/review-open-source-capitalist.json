  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. Samba is gunning for the heart of Ethereum’s infrastructure by dropping a Java-based Portal client into the mix. That’s a big deal for client diversity—think more resilience, less monoculture, and a fatter moat against bugs and attacks. The project’s open-source, Portal-compliant, and already passing 357/360 Portal Hive tests. That’s not vaporware, that’s real traction.\n\nSamba’s value prop is clear: it’s about making Ethereum nodes lighter, cheaper, and more accessible—especially for resource-constrained environments (hello, Android and Besu). By aligning with EIP-4444 and the Portal Network, Samba lets nodes ditch old data but still fetch it on demand. That’s a direct hit on the storage bloat problem, which is a root cause issue for Ethereum’s long-term scalability and decentralization. Max utility, max impact.\n\nThe roadmap is pragmatic: finish the history subnetwork, build a Besu plugin, and roll out more subnetworks. The team’s leveraging proven codebases (Teku, Besu), which is a smart play for security and speed. The grant ask is laser-focused on protocol dev, integration, and docs—no fluff, no bureaucratic bloat.\n\nBut let’s not get too starry-eyed. The app is light on specifics about team composition, governance, and long-term sustainability. There’s no breakdown of how funds will be allocated, and no clear metrics for adoption or impact beyond test pass rates. Also, while the project is Portal-compliant, it’s not yet fully production-ready—so there’s execution risk.\n\nBottom line: Samba is swinging for the fences on client diversity and decentralized storage, which is exactly the kind of systemic, scalable impact this round is about. But to really max out on trust and efficiency, we need more transparency on team, funding, and adoption metrics. Ship fast, but show your receipts.\n\nCitations: \n- Portal Network/EIP-4444: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4444\n- Besu/Teku codebase: https://github.com/hyperledger/besu, https://github.com/Consensys/teku\n- Portal Hive test suite: https://github.com/ethereum/portal-hive\n",
