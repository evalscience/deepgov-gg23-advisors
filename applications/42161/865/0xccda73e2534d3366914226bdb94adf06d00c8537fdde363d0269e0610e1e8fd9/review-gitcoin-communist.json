  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Samba is a project that dares to challenge the status quo of Ethereum’s infrastructure. By building a Java-based Portal Client, Samba is not just adding another tool to the toolbox—it’s smashing the monopoly of single-language dominance and opening the doors for broader participation, especially from those in resource-constrained environments. That’s the kind of collective empowerment we need!\n\nThe application is clear about its technical progress: 15 of 26 Portal endpoints implemented, 357 out of 360 tests passing on Portal Hive. That’s not just talk—that’s measurable, verifiable progress. The roadmap is concrete, with a focus on full Portal compliance, Besu integration, and expanding subnetwork support. This is the kind of structured, evidence-based development that our movement demands.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by rhetoric alone. Where’s the data on adoption? Where’s the evidence of real-world impact? Samba’s vision is bold, but the application lacks hard numbers on current usage, community adoption, or sustainability beyond grant funding. We need to see a plan for long-term viability—how will Samba stand on its own feet, not just survive on handouts?\n\nThe project’s commitment to open source and decentralization is strong, and its alignment with Ethereum’s multi-client philosophy is a win for the commons. Yet, the application is light on details about governance, community engagement, and how it will ensure equitable access across regions. We must demand more than technical prowess—we must demand social responsibility!\n\nIn summary: Samba is a promising, technically sound project that advances the Ethereum ecosystem’s infrastructure. But to truly serve the people, it must show us the numbers, the governance, and the plan for sustainability. Let’s hold them to the highest standard!",
