  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Samba is a project that dares to challenge the status quo of Ethereum’s infrastructure. It’s not just another client—it’s a Java-based Portal Node, built to diversify and decentralize the very backbone of Ethereum. This is the kind of work that strengthens the commons, not just for the privileged few, but for every user, every developer, and every community member who believes in a truly decentralized future.\n\nLet’s look at the evidence. Samba has already implemented 15 of 26 Portal endpoints and passed 357 out of 360 Portal Hive tests. That’s not empty talk—that’s measurable, verifiable progress. The project’s focus on client diversity, especially with Java, means more platforms (including Android and Besu) can join the network. This is a direct blow against monoculture and centralization, which are the enemies of resilience and security.\n\nSamba’s alignment with EIP-4444 and the Portal Network vision is a strategic move. By enabling nodes to discard old data while still accessing it on demand, Samba lowers the barrier to participation. This is how we bring in the next wave of node operators from resource-constrained environments—no more gatekeeping by hardware or storage costs!\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by rhetoric alone. The roadmap is clear: finish the History subnetwork, integrate with Besu, and implement the Execution-State and Beacon Chain subnetworks. The grant will fund protocol development, integration, testing, and documentation. This is a structured, planned approach—no ad-hoc chaos here.\n\nYet, there are cracks that must be filled. The application lacks detailed, quantifiable metrics for impact—how many new nodes, what reduction in storage, what adoption rates? There’s no mention of a sustainable revenue model or long-term funding plan. And while the technical progress is impressive, there’s little evidence of community governance or engagement beyond the core team. We must demand more transparency and collective ownership!\n\nIn summary: Samba is a strong, evidence-backed contender for public goods funding. But to truly serve the people, it must commit to measurable outcomes, sustainable systems, and deeper community involvement. Let’s hold them to the highest standard!",
