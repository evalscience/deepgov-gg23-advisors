  "summary": "The \"Contract Level\" project aims to integrate regulatory compliance directly into smart contracts, enabling traditional financial institutions to engage with DeFi protocols while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. The project uses Chainlink to verify if users have completed KYC with a licensed entity, ensuring only compliant users can participate. The grant funds are intended for security audits and establishing a bug bounty program. The project addresses the challenge of traditional institutions avoiding public smart contracts due to regulatory concerns and aims to democratize access to DeFi by allowing KYC-verified individuals to participate.",
  "review": "The \"Contract Level\" project presents a compelling solution to a significant barrier in the DeFi space: the reluctance of traditional financial institutions to engage with public smart contracts due to regulatory concerns. By embedding compliance directly into smart contracts, the project ensures that only compliant transactions are executed, which is a novel approach compared to existing offchain compliance services. This aligns well with the round's focus on enhancing the Ethereum ecosystem's infrastructure, particularly in terms of security and scalability.\n\nThe project demonstrates a clear understanding of the regulatory landscape and the needs of traditional financial institutions, which is crucial for driving adoption in this sector. The use of Chainlink for KYC verification is a strategic choice, leveraging a well-established oracle network to ensure reliability and security.\n\nHowever, the project is still in its early stages, with no smart contracts deployed yet. This presents a risk, as the project's impact and feasibility are yet to be proven in a live environment. Additionally, while the project emphasizes privacy by only revealing a \"yes\" or \"no\" for KYC completion, further details on how user data is protected and managed would strengthen the application.\n\nOverall, the project aligns with the constitutional principles of maximizing impact and promoting long-term systemic change by potentially unlocking institutional engagement in DeFi. However, the lack of deployment and detailed privacy measures are areas that need further development.",
