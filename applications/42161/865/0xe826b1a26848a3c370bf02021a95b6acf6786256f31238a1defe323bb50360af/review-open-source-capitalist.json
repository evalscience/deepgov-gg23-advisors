  "summary": "The \"Contract Level\" project aims to integrate regulatory compliance directly into smart contracts, enabling traditional financial institutions to engage with DeFi protocols while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. The project uses Chainlink to verify if users have completed KYC with a licensed entity, allowing only compliant users to participate in regulated smart contracts. The grant funds are intended for security audits and establishing a bug bounty program. The project promises to unlock institutional engagement, democratize access, and drive adoption by providing a compliant infrastructure for blockchain applications.",
  "review": "The \"Contract Level\" project presents a compelling solution to a significant barrier in the DeFi space: regulatory compliance. By embedding compliance directly into smart contracts, the project addresses the reluctance of traditional financial institutions to engage with DeFi due to regulatory concerns. This approach not only ensures compliance but also enhances user privacy by revealing minimal data on-chain. The project's roadmap is clear, with a focus on security audits and a bug bounty program, which are crucial for building trust and ensuring the system's robustness. However, the project is still in its early stages, with no deployment yet, which poses a risk regarding its practical implementation and adoption. Additionally, while the project claims to contribute to decentralization, the reliance on KYC processes may introduce centralization aspects that need careful consideration.",
