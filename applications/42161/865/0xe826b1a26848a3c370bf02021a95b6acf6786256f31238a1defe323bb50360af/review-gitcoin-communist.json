  "summary": "The grant application for 'Contract Level' presents a project aimed at embedding regulatory compliance directly into smart contracts, using Chainlink to verify KYC status before executing transactions. This approach is designed to enable traditional financial institutions to engage with DeFi protocols by ensuring compliance and preventing non-compliant transactions. The project seeks funding for security audits and a bug bounty program, with a roadmap that includes integrating Concero V2 for cross-chain interactions. The application highlights the project's potential to democratize access to DeFi and drive adoption by providing regulatory clarity.",
  "review": "The 'Contract Level' project addresses a significant barrier in the Ethereum ecosystem by providing a compliance solution that allows traditional financial institutions to engage with DeFi protocols. This is achieved by embedding KYC verification directly into smart contracts, ensuring that only compliant users can participate. The project is innovative in its approach to compliance, as it prevents non-compliant transactions from executing, unlike existing offchain solutions that monitor transactions post-execution. The application clearly outlines the project's goals, including the use of grant funds for security audits and a bug bounty program, which are crucial for ensuring the project's reliability and security. However, the application lacks detailed metrics or evidence of the project's impact on the Ethereum network's infrastructure, which is a key requirement for the grant round. Additionally, the project's sustainability model is not clearly defined, raising concerns about its long-term viability without continuous funding. The application would benefit from a more detailed explanation of how the project will achieve financial sustainability and a clearer demonstration of its contribution to the Ethereum ecosystem.",
