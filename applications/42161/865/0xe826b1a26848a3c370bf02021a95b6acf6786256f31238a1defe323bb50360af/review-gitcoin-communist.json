  "summary": "The \"Contract Level\" project aims to integrate regulatory compliance directly into smart contracts, enabling traditional financial institutions to engage with DeFi protocols by ensuring only compliant users can participate. The project uses Chainlink to verify KYC status without revealing user data, addressing privacy concerns. The grant funds are intended for security audits and establishing a bug bounty program. The project is not yet deployed but plans to integrate Concero V2 for cross-chain interactions.",
  "review": "The \"Contract Level\" project presents a compelling solution to a significant barrier in the DeFi space: the reluctance of traditional financial institutions to engage due to regulatory concerns. By embedding compliance directly into smart contracts, the project offers a proactive approach to ensuring only compliant transactions occur, which is a notable improvement over existing offchain compliance solutions. The use of Chainlink for KYC verification while maintaining user privacy is a strong point, aligning with the round's focus on enhancing privacy and security.\n\nHowever, the project is still in its early stages, with no deployment yet, which raises concerns about its current impact and the feasibility of its proposed solutions. The roadmap outlines a clear plan for using grant funds for security audits and a bug bounty program, which is essential for building trust and ensuring the system's robustness. Yet, the lack of a demonstrated sustainable revenue model or detailed evidence of measurable outcomes is a weakness, as it does not fully align with the model specification's emphasis on proven solutions and sustainable systems.\n\nOverall, while the project has potential and addresses a critical need in the Ethereum ecosystem, it requires further development and evidence of its effectiveness and sustainability to fully meet the grant's criteria.",
