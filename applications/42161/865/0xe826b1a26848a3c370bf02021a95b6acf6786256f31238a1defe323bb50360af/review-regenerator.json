  "summary": "The grant application for 'Contract Level' proposes a project that embeds regulatory compliance directly into smart contracts, aiming to enable traditional financial institutions to engage with DeFi protocols by ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. The project uses Chainlink to verify KYC status on-chain, ensuring only compliant users can participate. The grant funds are intended for security audits and establishing a bug bounty program. The project is not yet deployed but plans to integrate Concero V2 for cross-chain interactions.",
  "review": "The 'Contract Level' project presents a compelling solution to a significant barrier in the DeFi space: the reluctance of traditional financial institutions to engage due to regulatory concerns. By embedding compliance directly into smart contracts, the project addresses this issue head-on, potentially unlocking a new wave of institutional participation in DeFi. The use of Chainlink for on-chain KYC verification is innovative, ensuring privacy by only revealing a binary KYC status. This approach is a marked improvement over existing off-chain compliance solutions that only monitor transactions post-execution. However, the project is still in its early stages, with no deployment yet, which poses a risk regarding its feasibility and execution. The roadmap outlines a clear plan for using grant funds, focusing on security audits and a bug bounty program, which are crucial for building trust and ensuring the system's robustness. The project aligns well with the round's focus on enhancing Ethereum's infrastructure, particularly in terms of security and compliance, but it needs to demonstrate more concrete progress and community engagement to fully meet the eligibility criteria.",
