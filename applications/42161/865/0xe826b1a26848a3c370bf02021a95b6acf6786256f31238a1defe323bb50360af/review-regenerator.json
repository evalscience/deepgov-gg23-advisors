  "summary": "The grant application for 'Contract Level' proposes a project that embeds regulatory compliance directly into smart contracts, aiming to enable traditional financial institutions to engage with DeFi protocols by ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. The project uses Chainlink to verify KYC status on-chain, ensuring only compliant users can participate. The grant funds are intended for security audits and establishing a bug bounty program. The project is not yet deployed but plans to integrate Concero V2 for cross-chain interactions.",
  "review": "The 'Contract Level' project presents a novel approach to integrating regulatory compliance into smart contracts, which could significantly enhance the Ethereum ecosystem by enabling traditional financial institutions to participate in DeFi. This aligns with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure. The project emphasizes privacy by only revealing a binary KYC status on-chain, which is a strong point in terms of user data protection. However, the application lacks detailed metrics or examples of its current impact or potential scalability, which are crucial for assessing its contribution to the Ethereum network. Additionally, while the project outlines a roadmap, it does not provide specific timelines or milestones, making it difficult to evaluate the feasibility and progress of the proposed developments. The project also does not address environmental sustainability, which is a key consideration in the model specification. Overall, the project shows promise in terms of innovation and addressing regulatory challenges in DeFi, but it requires more detailed planning and consideration of broader impacts.",
