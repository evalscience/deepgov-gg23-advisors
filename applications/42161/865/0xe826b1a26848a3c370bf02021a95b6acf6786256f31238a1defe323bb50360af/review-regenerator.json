  "summary": "The grant application for 'Contract Level' proposes a project that embeds regulatory compliance directly into smart contracts, aiming to enable traditional financial institutions to engage with DeFi protocols by ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. The project uses Chainlink to verify KYC status on-chain, ensuring only compliant users can participate. The grant funds are intended for security audits and establishing a bug bounty program. The project is not yet deployed but plans to integrate Concero V2 for cross-chain interactions.",
  "review": "The 'Contract Level' project presents a compelling case for enhancing the Ethereum ecosystem by addressing regulatory compliance issues that hinder traditional financial institutions from participating in DeFi. By embedding compliance directly into smart contracts, the project offers a novel solution that could significantly broaden the adoption of blockchain technology among regulated entities. The use of Chainlink for on-chain KYC verification is innovative and aligns with the round's focus on enhancing privacy and security.\n\nHowever, the application lacks detailed metrics or examples of its current impact on the Ethereum network, which is a requirement for this grant round. Additionally, while the project outlines a clear roadmap for using the grant funds, it does not provide sufficient information on how it plans to engage with the community or ensure environmental sustainability, which are key aspects of the model specification.\n\nOverall, the project aligns well with the round's goals of strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure and demonstrates potential for significant impact, but it needs to address the gaps in community engagement and sustainability considerations.",
