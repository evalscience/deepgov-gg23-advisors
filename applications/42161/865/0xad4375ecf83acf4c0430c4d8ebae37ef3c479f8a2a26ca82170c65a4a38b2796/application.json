Everyday users and institutions require a certain level of privacy akin to a traditional bank account before they will feel comfortable adopting stable coins for everyday usage. Stablecoin transactions on public blockchains expose sensitive data, including amounts, senders, and recipients, leading to significant privacy concerns for both businesses and individuals.\n\nIn addition, existing privacy solutions either require the use of specific blockchains or do not adhere to regulatory or compliant standards.\n\nAxiompay enables private and secure stable coin transfers by decoupling privacy from the underlying blockchain in a regulatory compliant manner through the use of smart contract directly deployed on-chain. We believe that enabling private transfers will significantly drive the adoption of stable coin usage for both individuals and institutions.\n",

      "description": "AxiomPay is a privacy preserving protocol for Stablecoin payments \n\n\nThe stablecoin market is growing rapidly on Ethereum  but true adoption of stablecoins for payments is still limited by a lack of privacy on the blockchain. \n\nWith the constant improvement of on-chain tracking & analysis tools, we see three key problems with Stablecoin payments:\n\n(1) Account Balances Leaked \n(2) Transaction data details Leaked \n(3) Disclosure of payment execution relationship Graphs \n\n\nAxiomPay aims to expand existing stablecoin payments that can simultaneously support both real-world and virtual payments, while ensuring user privacy and meeting the criteria of portability, regulatory compliance, high performance, and user-friendliness\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nPitch Deck: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VnErJL-BDm5suPjYNfQGvQYbJ7-TFGfd/view?usp=drive_link\n\n\n",
