  "summary": "AxiomPay is a privacy-preserving protocol designed to enhance the privacy of stablecoin transactions on the Ethereum network. The project aims to address privacy concerns by using smart contracts that decouple privacy from the underlying blockchain, ensuring regulatory compliance. AxiomPay combines zero-knowledge proof payment verification, homomorphic encryption, and MPC-based View Key technology to maintain user privacy while supporting stablecoin transactions. The project is currently seeking funding for audits and the development of an app and SDK to facilitate private transfers for users and businesses.",
  "review": "The AxiomPay project presents a compelling solution to a significant issue in the Ethereum ecosystem: the lack of privacy in stablecoin transactions. By leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption, AxiomPay aims to provide a privacy-preserving layer that is both user-friendly and compliant with regulatory standards. This approach addresses a critical barrier to the adoption of stablecoins for everyday use by individuals and institutions, as highlighted in the application (Question 5). The project's focus on regulatory compliance and user accessibility sets it apart from existing solutions like Tornado Cash and Aztec, which have limitations in these areas (Question 7). However, the application lacks specific metrics or examples of how the project contributes to the Ethereum network's infrastructure, which is a requirement for the grant round (Round Details). Additionally, while the core smart contracts are completed, the project has not yet deployed them, which raises questions about the project's current stage and readiness (Question 10).",
