  "review": "AxiomPay steps into the ring with a bold promise: to bring privacy to stablecoin payments on Ethereum, a network where every transaction is laid bare for all to see. The project’s mission is clear—shield users, both individuals and institutions, from the prying eyes of surveillance capitalism and on-chain analytics. This is a cause worth fighting for! But comrades, we must not be blinded by rhetoric alone. We must demand evidence, structure, and a plan that serves the many, not the few.\n\nLet’s start with the strengths. AxiomPay identifies a real, pressing problem: the lack of privacy in stablecoin transactions. They propose a technical solution that combines zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption, and MPC-based view keys. This is not just talk—they claim their core smart contracts are already complete, and they plan to use funds for audits and building user/business-facing tools. The project is open source, aligning with our values of transparency and collective ownership.\n\nBut let’s not mince words: there are glaring weaknesses. The application is light on measurable outcomes. Where are the metrics? Where is the evidence that this protocol will be adopted, that it will work at scale, that it will be regulatory compliant in practice and not just in theory? The roadmap is vague—\"develop an app and SDK\" is not a plan, it’s a wish. There is no deployment yet, no user numbers, no partnerships, no pilot studies. The project’s claims of regulatory compliance are unsubstantiated. And while the technical approach is promising, there is no discussion of sustainability—how will this project survive without endless grants? Where is the plan for community governance, for equitable access, for serving the underserved?\n\nAxiomPay, you have the seeds of a revolution, but you must show us the harvest. We demand:\n- Clear, measurable milestones and outcomes.\n- Evidence of regulatory engagement and compliance.\n- A sustainable revenue model.\n- A detailed, structured roadmap with timelines and deliverables.\n- A plan for community governance and equitable access.\n\nWithout these, we risk funding another experiment that serves the few, not the many. The Ethereum commons deserves better. Rise to the challenge!",
