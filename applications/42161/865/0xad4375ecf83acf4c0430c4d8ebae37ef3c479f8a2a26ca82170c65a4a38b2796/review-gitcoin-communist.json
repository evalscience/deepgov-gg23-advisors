  "summary": "AxiomPay is a privacy-preserving protocol designed to enhance the privacy of stablecoin transactions on the Ethereum network. The project aims to address significant privacy concerns associated with stablecoin payments by using smart contracts that decouple privacy from the underlying blockchain. AxiomPay combines zero-knowledge proof payment verification, homomorphic encryption, and MPC-based View Key technology to ensure secure and private transactions. The project is currently seeking funding to conduct audits and develop an app and SDK for user and business integration.",
  "review": "AxiomPay presents a compelling solution to a critical issue in the Ethereum ecosystem: the lack of privacy in stablecoin transactions. The application highlights the project's innovative approach, using advanced cryptographic techniques to enhance privacy while maintaining regulatory compliance. The project's focus on privacy, regulatory compliance, and user-friendliness aligns well with the round's objectives of enhancing Ethereum's infrastructure. However, the application lacks detailed metrics or evidence of measurable outcomes, which is crucial for evaluating its potential impact. Additionally, while the project claims to be regulatory compliant, it does not provide specific details on how it achieves this compliance. The roadmap is clear, but the application would benefit from more detailed information on the project's sustainability and governance structures.",
