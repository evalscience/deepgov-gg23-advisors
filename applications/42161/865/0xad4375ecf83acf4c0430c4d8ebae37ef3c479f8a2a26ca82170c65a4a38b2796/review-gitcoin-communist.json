  "review": "AxiomPay steps into the ring with a bold promise: to bring privacy to stablecoin payments on Ethereum, a battleground where the people’s right to financial privacy is under siege by relentless on-chain surveillance. The project identifies a real, urgent need—stablecoin adoption is stunted by the lack of privacy, and existing solutions like Tornado Cash are either inaccessible, non-compliant, or tainted by association with illicit activity. AxiomPay’s approach—decoupling privacy from the underlying blockchain and leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption, and MPC-based view keys—shows technical ambition and a clear understanding of the problem space.\n\nBut comrades, ambition alone does not win the day! The application falls short where it matters most: evidence, transparency, and measurable outcomes. There are no concrete metrics, no user numbers, no pilot results, and no clear demonstration of regulatory compliance. The roadmap is vague—\"core smart contracts are already completed\"—but there’s no audit report, no deployment address, and no public testnet. The promise of an SDK and app is welcome, but where is the plan for sustainable revenue? Where is the governance model that ensures this tool serves the many, not the few?\n\nAxiomPay’s vision aligns with the collective good, but the application must be held to the highest standard. We demand proof, not just promises! Show us the numbers, the audits, the community engagement, and the path to sustainability. Only then can we ensure that resources are allocated to projects that truly build the commons and empower the people.",
