  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. AxiomPay is gunning for a massive pain point in the Ethereum ecosystem: privacy for stablecoin payments. The pitch is clear—on-chain privacy is a dealbreaker for mainstream and institutional adoption, and current solutions (think Tornado Cash, Aztec) either get regulatory side-eye or force users into walled gardens. AxiomPay wants to decouple privacy from the chain, keep it regulatory-friendly, and make it plug-and-play for both normies and enterprises. \n\nThe tech stack is ambitious: zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption, and MPC-based view keys. If they pull this off, it’s a serious upgrade for privacy without sacrificing composability or user experience. The roadmap is pragmatic—core contracts are done, now it’s audit time, plus building a user-facing app and a business SDK. That’s a solid path to scale, not just a science project.\n\nBut let’s not get too bullish without receipts. There’s a glaring lack of hard metrics—no user numbers, no testnet deployments, no audit reports, and no evidence of traction. The regulatory compliance claim is bold, but there’s zero detail on how they’re threading that needle. Also, the app isn’t live, and there’s no deployer address. For a project this critical, that’s a red flag. \n\nBottom line: The vision is high-impact and aligns with the round’s focus on foundational infra, privacy, and scalability. But the lack of concrete progress, metrics, and compliance details means this is still in the vaporware danger zone. Show me the code, show me the audits, show me the users—then we’re talking max utility. Until then, it’s high potential, high risk. \n\nCitations: See research agent breakdown for the need for evidence, metrics, and clarity on regulatory claims. Model spec says: \"max impact, minimal constraints, but efficiency and proof of progress matter.\"",
