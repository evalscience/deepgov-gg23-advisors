  "review": "Alright, let’s cut through the noise and get to the core. AxiomPay is gunning for a massive pain point in the Ethereum ecosystem: privacy for stablecoin payments. The pitch is clear—on-chain privacy is a dealbreaker for mainstream and institutional adoption, and current solutions (Tornado Cash, Aztec) either get regulatory heat or force users onto niche chains. AxiomPay claims to decouple privacy from the underlying chain, using smart contracts, ZK proofs, homomorphic encryption, and MPC-based view keys. That’s a spicy tech stack, and if it works, it’s a big win for Ethereum’s foundational infra.\n\nStrengths? The project is laser-focused on a root cause: lack of privacy throttling stablecoin adoption. The approach is innovative, regulatory-aware, and aims for composability and user-friendliness. The roadmap is pragmatic: contracts are done, next up is audits, a user app, and a business SDK. That’s a direct, high-leverage path—no governance bloat, no endless whitepapers.\n\nBut let’s not get starry-eyed. Weaknesses? The app isn’t live, there’s no deployment address, and there’s zero hard metrics or usage data. The claim of regulatory compliance is bold, but there’s no detail on how compliance is achieved or maintained. The pitch deck is linked, but not summarized or referenced in the app. There’s also no public group chat or community engagement channel—transparency and open-source ethos need more proof.\n\nRequested changes: Show me the code in action. Deploy to testnet, drop a contract address, and open up a public chat. Give specifics on regulatory compliance—what frameworks, what jurisdictions, what legal review? And let’s see some metrics or at least a plan for measuring impact. Build in public, or it’s just vaporware.\n\nBottom line: High potential, but needs more receipts. Ship, show, and share—then you’ll be ready to disrupt the system for real.",
