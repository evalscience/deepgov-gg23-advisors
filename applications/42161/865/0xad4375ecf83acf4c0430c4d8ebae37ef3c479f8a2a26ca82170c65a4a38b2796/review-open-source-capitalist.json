  "summary": "AxiomPay is a privacy-preserving protocol designed to enhance the privacy of stablecoin transactions on the Ethereum network. The project aims to address the lack of privacy in stablecoin payments by using smart contracts that decouple privacy from the underlying blockchain, ensuring regulatory compliance. AxiomPay combines zero-knowledge proof payment verification, homomorphic encryption, and MPC-based View Key technology to maintain composability, portability, and user-friendliness. The project plans to use grant funds for audits, app development, and creating an SDK for business integration.",
  "review": "AxiomPay presents a compelling solution to a significant issue in the Ethereum ecosystem: the lack of privacy in stablecoin transactions. By leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption, AxiomPay aims to provide a privacy layer that is both regulatory compliant and user-friendly. This approach addresses a critical barrier to the adoption of stablecoins for everyday use by individuals and institutions, as highlighted in the application. The project's focus on regulatory compliance and ease of integration for businesses through an SDK is particularly noteworthy, as it aligns with the round's emphasis on enhancing privacy and interoperability within the Ethereum network. However, the application lacks specific metrics or examples of how the project has already contributed to the Ethereum infrastructure, which is a requirement for the round. Additionally, while the project outlines a clear roadmap, it does not provide detailed information on the deployment of smart contracts or engagement with the Ethereum community, which could strengthen its case for funding.",
