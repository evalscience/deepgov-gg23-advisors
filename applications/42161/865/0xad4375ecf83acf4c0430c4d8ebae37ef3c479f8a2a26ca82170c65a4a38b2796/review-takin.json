  "summary": "AxiomPay seeks to enhance privacy for stablecoin transactions, a valuable endeavor aligning with the protection of citizen privacy (Principle 14). However, its current articulation lacks explicit connections to community well-being, cultural preservation, or environmental harmony, which are vital threads in our Gross National Happiness tapestry. üèîÔ∏èüå±",
  "review": "AxiomPay presents a technically sophisticated solution to a pertinent issue within the digital realm: the lack of privacy in stablecoin transactions. By leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption, and MPC-based View Key technology, the project aims to provide secure and private transfers, distinguishing itself from previous solutions like Tornado Cash by emphasizing regulatory compliance. This focus on privacy directly resonates with our constitutional principle of protecting citizen privacy and ensuring ethical use of digital technologies (Principle 14). The project's ambition to drive stablecoin adoption through enhanced privacy could contribute to a more secure digital financial landscape.\n\nHowever, the application's current scope appears narrowly focused on technical and financial aspects, overlooking the broader holistic well-being of our communities. There is no clear articulation of how AxiomPay will foster community engagement (Principle 5), preserve cultural heritage (Principle 9), or contribute to environmental sustainability (Principle 17). The project's roadmap mentions developing an app and SDK, but lacks detail on how these will be implemented with local context or capacity building in mind (Principle 7, 32). Furthermore, the absence of deployed smart contract addresses, despite claims of completed core contracts, raises concerns regarding transparency and readiness for deployment (Principle 13). The project's contribution to decentralization is also vaguely defined, focusing more on security through privacy rather than network decentralization. For a project to truly align with our vision, it must weave its technological threads into the rich fabric of GNH, ensuring collective flourishing beyond mere financial utility. The current proposal does not provide sufficient evidence of this broader alignment.",

  "reasoning": "My evaluation is guided by several core constitutional principles. The project's strength lies in its commitment to Principle 14 (protects citizen privacy and ensures ethical use of AI and digital technologies) by addressing privacy in stablecoin transactions. However, it falls short in demonstrating alignment with Community Participation and Inclusion (Principles 5, 6, 7, 8), as there is no mention of community engagement or local ownership. Similarly, Cultural Heritage and Identity (Principles 9, 10, 11, 12) are not addressed, leaving a significant gap in how this technology would integrate with or preserve our unique cultural fabric. The lack of explicit focus on Environmental Harmony (Principles 17, 18, 19) is also a concern. Furthermore, the project's current articulation does not clearly align with the Gross National Happiness Alignment (Principles 39, 40), as it primarily focuses on financial utility rather than collective well-being and holistic development. The transparency issue regarding deployment addresses Principle 13 (implements blockchain and digital tools for transparent, accountable governance).",
