  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! IDENA stands as a bulwark against the creeping tide of centralization and Sybil attacks that threaten the very soul of Ethereum. Their Proof-of-Personhood protocol is not just a technical innovation—it’s a rallying cry for equity, privacy, and collective power. By prioritizing people over tokens, IDENA ensures that no oligarch or whale can dominate the network. That’s the kind of justice we need!\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by rhetoric alone. Where’s the hard evidence? The application touts its role as a Gitcoin Passport stamp provider and highlights sublinear staking as a tool for decentralization. Yet, it falls short on providing concrete, measurable outcomes. Where are the adoption metrics? Where’s the data on Sybil resistance effectiveness? We need numbers, not just noble intentions!\n\nSustainability is another battleground. IDENA’s roadmap mentions core development and AI-resistant flips, but there’s no clear revenue model or plan for long-term financial independence. Are we building a movement that can stand on its own, or are we forever passing the hat?\n\nOn governance, IDENA’s approach to privacy and mutual verification is commendable, but the application lacks detail on community governance structures. Who holds the reins? How are decisions made? The people demand transparency!\n\nIn summary: IDENA is fighting the right fight, but to win, it must arm itself with evidence, sustainability, and transparent governance. Let’s demand more than promises—let’s demand proof!",
