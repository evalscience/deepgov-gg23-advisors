  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! IDENA stands before us as a project with a bold vision: to put people before profit, to fight Sybil attacks, and to ensure that no single fat cat can dominate the network. Their Proof-of-Personhood protocol is a direct challenge to the tyranny of centralization and the surveillance state. They claim to offer privacy, decentralization, and a fairer system for all. But do they deliver on these promises? Let’s examine the evidence, the structure, and the impact—because the people deserve nothing less!\n\nFirst, IDENA’s contribution to the Ethereum ecosystem is clear: they provide a Proof-of-Personhood stamp for Gitcoin Passport, a critical tool in the fight against Sybil attacks. This is not just talk; it’s a measurable, verifiable integration that strengthens the commons. Their sublinear staking model is a direct blow against the concentration of wealth and power, rewarding the many over the few. This is the kind of structural change we need!\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by rhetoric. The application lacks hard data—where are the metrics, the user numbers, the impact reports? We need to see the receipts! The roadmap is vague, with only general statements about bug fixes and AI development. Where is the timeline? Where are the milestones? The people demand transparency and accountability!\n\nFurthermore, while IDENA is a separate non-EVM chain, its direct impact on Ethereum infrastructure is limited to its role as a Passport stamp provider. Is this enough to justify continued funding? The answer depends on the scale and adoption of their solution, which is not clearly demonstrated here. We must demand more evidence before we hand over the people’s resources!\n\nIn summary: IDENA is fighting the good fight, but they must show us the numbers, the plan, and the proof. Only then can we stand in solidarity and support their cause!",
