  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! RubyScore claims to be a champion for the Ethereum network, promising decentralized reputation, cross-chain identity, and transaction efficiency. But do they deliver for the people, or is this just another shiny toy for the privileged few?\n\nFirst, the project’s core—decentralized reputation and cross-chain identity—addresses real, burning issues in Web3: Sybil attacks, bot manipulation, and fragmented user experience. The academic research backs this up: trustless reputation and self-sovereign identity are the future, and RubyScore is marching in step with these ideals. Their use of LayerZero for cross-chain identity is a solid, evidence-based approach, not just empty hype.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by big words! Where’s the hard data? Where are the metrics showing that RubyScore’s system actually reduces bot activity or increases real user engagement? The application is heavy on vision, light on proof. We need numbers, comrades! How many bots have been stopped? How much gas has been saved? How many users have benefited across regions?\n\nOn sustainability, RubyScore’s roadmap is ambitious—expanding to new L2s, building APIs, and growing the dev team. But there’s no mention of a revenue model or how this project will stand on its own feet. Are we building a public good, or a perpetual grant-dependent experiment? The people deserve clarity!\n\nGovernance and equity? The project is open source and claims to serve the whole Ethereum ecosystem, but there’s no evidence of community governance, nor any plan to ensure geographic or demographic equity. Who decides the rules of reputation? Who benefits most? The working class, or the whales?\n\nIn summary: RubyScore is fighting the right battles, but the application lacks the hard evidence, sustainability plan, and governance structure that our movement demands. We need more than promises—we need proof, and a plan for the long haul!",
