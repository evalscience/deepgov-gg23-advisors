  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. Commit-Boost is gunning for the heart of Ethereum’s validator infrastructure, aiming to standardize the wild west of proposer commitments and preconfirmations. This isn’t just another sidecar—this is a full-stack, open-source, Rust-powered juggernaut with real traction: 7% of blocks already running through it, 20+ teams in the mix, and a clear mission to reduce fragmentation and risk for stakers. That’s max utility, baby.\n\nThe project’s impact is broad and systemic—think fewer attack vectors, less validator overhead, and a unified interface for all things PBS and preconfs. It’s not just patching holes; it’s laying down new rails for the next era of Ethereum scaling. The roadmap is pragmatic: more DVT integrations, transparency dashboards, and slashing protection. Plus, they’re stepping up to take the hard fork burden off core devs—freeing up the best minds for bigger problems. That’s how you scale impact.\n\nOn the innovation front, Commit-Boost is pushing the envelope with open standards, modularity, and a no-vendor-lock-in ethos. The open-source cred is legit, and the project is already audited and tested on Holesky. The only real gap? More granular metrics on adoption growth, and a clearer breakdown of how grant funds will be allocated for each roadmap item. But the fundamentals are strong: this is high-leverage, high-impact, and built for the long haul.\n\nIn short: Commit-Boost is a textbook fit for this round—maximizing systemic impact, driving decentralization, and setting the stage for Ethereum’s next leap. Let’s see them ship even faster.",
