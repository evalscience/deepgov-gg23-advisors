  "summary": "Commit-Boost is an open-source Ethereum validator sidecar designed to standardize communication between validators and proposer commitment protocols. It aims to enhance network security, reduce fragmentation, and streamline operations for validators. The project is already in production, with 7% of Ethereum blocks being produced via Commit-Boost. The grant will fund a full-time developer to integrate with DVT solutions, build a database for transparency, and add features like slashing protection.",
  "review": "The Commit-Boost project presents a compelling case for enhancing the Ethereum network's infrastructure. It addresses critical challenges such as security, decentralization, and operational efficiency by providing a unified sidecar for validators. The project's impact is evident, with 7% of Ethereum blocks currently being produced through Commit-Boost, and its adoption by all preconfirmation teams. The project aligns well with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's foundational infrastructure, demonstrating significant contributions to the network's development and security. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics on its impact and a clearer roadmap for future developments.",
