  "summary": "Commit-Boost is an open-source Ethereum validator sidecar designed to standardize communication between validators and proposer commitment protocols. It aims to enhance network security, reduce fragmentation, and streamline operations for validators. The project is supported by over 20 teams across Ethereum and is already in production, with 7% of Ethereum blocks being produced via Commit-Boost. The grant will fund a full-time developer to integrate with DVT solutions, build a database for transparency, and add features like slashing protection.",
  "review": "The application for Commit-Boost presents a compelling case for its contribution to the Ethereum network's infrastructure. The project addresses significant challenges such as security, decentralization, and operational efficiency by providing a unified sidecar for validators. This aligns well with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's foundational infrastructure. The project's open-source nature and community-driven approach are commendable, meeting the eligibility criteria for Gitcoin Grants. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the project's environmental sustainability efforts and a clearer roadmap for future developments.",
