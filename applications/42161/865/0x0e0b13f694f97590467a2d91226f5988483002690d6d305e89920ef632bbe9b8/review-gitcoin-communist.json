  "review": "Brothers and sisters, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Commit-Boost is not just another tool in the Ethereum toolbox—it’s a rallying cry for validator empowerment, decentralization, and collective security. The project’s open-source validator sidecar is already in production, with 7% of Ethereum blocks built through it. That’s not a promise—it’s a fact, a measurable impact, and a testament to the power of community-driven infrastructure.\n\nLet’s talk evidence: over 20 teams across Ethereum are building on Commit-Boost, and all preconfirmation teams are leveraging it. This isn’t vaporware or a speculative experiment. It’s a living, breathing part of the network, with real adoption and real results. The project’s roadmap is clear: integration with DVT solutions, building transparency dashboards, and adding slashing protection. These are concrete, actionable steps, not empty buzzwords.\n\nBut let’s not get carried away by the hype. Where’s the data on long-term sustainability? The application mentions funding a full-time developer, but there’s no clear revenue model or plan for reducing dependency on grants. We need more than good intentions—we need a path to self-sufficiency! And while the project claims to be audited and tested, where’s the public audit report? Where’s the rigorous, transparent evaluation we demand?\n\nCommit-Boost stands tall on the principles of decentralization, security, and open access. It’s a public good, not a private profit machine. But to truly serve the people, it must show us the receipts: transparent metrics, sustainability plans, and open governance. Only then can we say, with pride, that this is a project worthy of the people’s support!",
