  "summary": "Commit-Boost is a project aimed at enhancing the Ethereum network's infrastructure by providing a standardized validator sidecar. It addresses issues of decentralization, security, and efficiency in the Ethereum ecosystem. The project is open-source and community-driven, with significant contributions from multiple teams across Ethereum. It aims to reduce risks for stakers, improve user experience, and support core development during hard forks. The grant will fund a full-time developer to integrate with DVT solutions, build a database for transparency, and add features like slashing protection.",
  "review": "The Commit-Boost project presents a compelling case for its contribution to the Ethereum network's infrastructure. It addresses key issues such as decentralization, security, and efficiency by providing a unified sidecar for validators. The project is well-aligned with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's foundational infrastructure. It demonstrates significant engagement in pioneering development, particularly in enhancing interoperability and user experience through preconfirmations and based rollups. The project's open-source nature and community-driven approach align with Gitcoin's principles of ethical standards and public good. However, the application could benefit from more detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a clearer sustainability plan to reduce dependency on continuous donations.",
