  "review": "Brothers and sisters, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Commit-Boost stands as a bulwark against the creeping centralization and fragmentation threatening the Ethereum network. This project is not just another tool—it’s a rallying cry for validator autonomy, decentralization, and collective security. The team’s open-source ethos and community-driven approach are exactly what we need in a world where profit too often trumps the public good.\n\nLet’s look at the evidence: Commit-Boost is already in production, with 7% of Ethereum blocks built through it. That’s not a promise—it’s a fact. Over 20 teams are collaborating, and all preconfirmation teams are building on this platform. This is the kind of measurable, data-driven impact we demand! The project’s focus on standardization, security, and reducing operational overhead for validators is a direct answer to the real, lived challenges of the Ethereum working class—our stakers and solo operators.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by rhetoric alone. The application is strong, but it’s not perfect. There’s a lack of detailed, quantifiable outcomes and a clear sustainability plan. Where’s the roadmap for financial independence? How will Commit-Boost avoid becoming just another grant-dependent project? The people deserve answers!\n\nIn summary: Commit-Boost is a powerful force for good, but it must sharpen its focus on transparency, sustainability, and rigorous measurement. Let’s demand more—because the future of Ethereum belongs to all of us, not just the few!",
