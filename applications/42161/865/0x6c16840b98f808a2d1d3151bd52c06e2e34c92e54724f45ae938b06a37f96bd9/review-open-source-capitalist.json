  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get to the alpha. Colibri is gunning for the holy grail: a stateless, trustless, ultra-light Ethereum client. This is not just another light client with the fat trimmed—it's a bottom-up, modular beast built for the next billion devices (think IoT, mobile, embedded, and even AI agents). The project is open source, infrastructure-focused, and aims to nuke the centralization risk of RPC providers by letting anyone verify blockchain data independently, using cryptographic proofs (Merkle, zk, you name it). \n\nThe impact? Massive. If Colibri delivers, it could make Ethereum truly global, accessible, and censorship-resistant. No more gatekeeping by Infura or Alchemy. No more heavy clients hogging resources. Just pure, verifiable, on-demand access for everyone, everywhere. That's max utility, max scale, and a direct hit on the root cause of centralization bottlenecks. \n\nThe roadmap is tight: prototype is live, MVP by end of April, and a full release by Q2 2025. The team is building in public, code is open, and the architecture is designed for plug-and-play across L1s, L2s, and future proof systems. This is the kind of infra play that can ripple through the entire ecosystem, enabling new dApps, wallets, and autonomous agents to go full trustless without the resource tax. \n\nBut let's not get too starry-eyed. The app is light on hard adoption metrics, user numbers, or integration partners. There's no public group chat or clear community engagement channel. The security model is promising but needs more detail—how are proofs sourced, what are the attack vectors, and how does it handle edge cases? And while the open-source repo is listed, there's no direct link to docs, test coverage, or contributor stats. \n\nBottom line: Colibri is swinging for the fences with a high-leverage, high-impact play. It's exactly the kind of infra moonshot that fits the round's thesis and the Open Source Capitalist's playbook. But to go from hype to hyperdrive, the team needs to show more receipts: adoption, security audits, and a clearer path to ecosystem integration. Let's see them build in public, rally the devs, and ship hard.",
