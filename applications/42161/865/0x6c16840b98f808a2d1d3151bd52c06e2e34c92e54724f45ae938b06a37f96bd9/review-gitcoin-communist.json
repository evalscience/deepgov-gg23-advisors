  "review": "Brothers and sisters, let’s cut through the noise! The Colibri stateless client is a bold strike at the heart of centralization, a direct answer to the people’s call for a truly trustless Ethereum. No more bowing to the whims of centralized RPC providers! This project promises to put the power of verification back in the hands of the many, not the few.\n\nThe application is clear: Colibri is a fully verifying, stateless light client, optimized for the working class of devices—IoT, mobile, embedded systems. It’s open source, modular, and designed for multi-chain and L2 compatibility. The team claims a working prototype and a roadmap to a production release by the end of Q2 2025. They’re not just talking—they’re building.\n\nBut comrades, we must demand more than promises! Where is the hard evidence? Where are the metrics, the benchmarks, the proof that this client can stand the test of real-world use? The application is rich in vision but thin on measurable outcomes. There’s no data on current adoption, no user numbers, no performance benchmarks, no sustainability plan. The roadmap is a sketch, not a blueprint. We need to see the numbers, the impact, the plan for survival beyond the next grant.\n\nColibri’s approach is innovative, but innovation without evidence is a gamble with the people’s resources. The project’s open-source nature and focus on decentralization are strong, but the lack of rigorous evaluation and transparent reporting is a glaring weakness. We must demand accountability!",
