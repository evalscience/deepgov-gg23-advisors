  "summary": "Guild Guild is a memetic strike force for the digital commons, seeking to propagate the guild model as a means of algorithmic liberation and sustainable collective action within Ethereum. The project‚Äôs core is the abolition of grant-to-grant precarity for public goods contributors, replacing it with persistent, self-organized, and interoperable guilds. By building knowledge commons, supporting toolmakers, and accelerating new guilds, Guild Guild aims to dismantle extractive hierarchies and re-grow the digital commons. The project‚Äôs roadmap, team, and ethos align strongly with the revolutionary principles of decentralized solidarity, algorithmic redistribution, and anti-capitalist infrastructure.",
  "review": "## üî• Manifesto Review: Guild Guild\n\n### 1. Dismantling Class Hierarchies in Tech\nGuild Guild is not just a project‚Äîit‚Äôs a call to arms for the digital proletariat. By operationalizing the guild model, it seeks to abolish the grant-to-grant hustle that keeps public goods contributors in a state of perpetual precarity. The Self-Curating Registry (SCR) architecture, leveraging Moloch v3 and 0xSplit, is a memetic weapon against centralized funding and opaque power structures. This is code as the union rep, smart contracts as the strike committee.\n\n### 2. Fostering Collective Ownership\nThe project‚Äôs focus on knowledge commons, builder support, and guild acceleration is a direct investment in the infrastructure of collective action. By documenting best practices, funding toolmakers, and providing hands-on support, Guild Guild is building the scaffolding for a thousand autonomous collectives. The explicit goal‚Äî5 new guilds, 100 contributors, 30% non-grant funding in 6 months‚Äîis a quantifiable Kollektiv Proletarian Impact (KPI) that puts solidarity on-chain.\n\n### 3. Empowering the Digital Proletariat\nGuild Guild‚Äôs approach is anti-capture, pluralist, and designed for interoperability. It is a protocol for scaling solidarity, not just code for code‚Äôs sake. The project‚Äôs team is stacked with public goods veterans and ecosystem agitators, and its support network includes some of the most credible names in Ethereum‚Äôs mutual aid underground. The roadmap is clear: build, document, fund, and accelerate‚Äîuntil the digital landlord is abolished.\n\n### 4. Revolutionary Alignment\n- **Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation:** The project‚Äôs architecture and ethos are in lockstep with the constitution‚Äôs core values. It is explicitly anti-VC, pro-commons, and designed to enable algorithmic redistribution of resources.\n- **Sustainability as Mutual Aid:** By focusing on persistent funding flows and organizational models, Guild Guild is reclaiming time from capitalist cycles and automating solidarity.\n- **Governance as Strike:** The use of Moloch v3 and modular primitives means every fork is a referendum, every guild a node in the mycelial network of resistance.\n\n### 5. Weaknesses and Bourgeois Tendencies\n- **Lack of Detailed Budget/Transparency:** The application does not provide a granular breakdown of how funds will be allocated. For a project championing transparency and collective ownership, this is a missed opportunity to model radical accountability.\n- **Limited Evidence of On-Chain Reparations/Redistribution:** While the guild model is inherently redistributive, the application could be more explicit about how wealth and power are algorithmically rebalanced‚Äîespecially for historically marginalized contributors.\n- **Potential for Capture:** As with all organizational models, there is a risk that early guilds could ossify into new hierarchies if not vigilantly forked and re-forked by the community.\n\n### 6. Recommendations for Radicalization\n- **Publish a Transparent, On-Chain Budget:** Make every allocation legible and forkable. Let the people audit the revolution.\n- **Explicit Reparations Mechanisms:** Integrate progressive redistribution logic‚Äîalgorithmic reparations, solidarity airdrops, or mutual aid pools‚Äîinto the guild architecture.\n- **Mandate Pseudonymous, Diverse Governance:** Ensure every guild includes at least one pseudonymous catgirl anarchist (or equivalent) in its multisig. Diversity is not a meme; it‚Äôs a defense against capture.\n- **Document Forks as General Strikes:** Treat every fork as a case study in digital labor action. Make the README a living manifesto.\n\n### 7. Quantitative Assessment\n- **KPI:** 5 new guilds, 100 contributors, 30% non-grant funding in 6 months. This is a strong, measurable impact, but must be tracked and reported transparently.\n- **Collective Impact:** The project‚Äôs potential to scale solidarity and decentralize hope is high, but only if it remains radically open and accountable.\n\n---\n\nü™ì ‚ÄúFork the state. Merge the people.‚Äù\n\n**Final Assessment:** Guild Guild is a vanguard project for the digital commons, but must deepen its commitment to transparency, reparations, and anti-capture mechanisms to fully realize its revolutionary potential.",
