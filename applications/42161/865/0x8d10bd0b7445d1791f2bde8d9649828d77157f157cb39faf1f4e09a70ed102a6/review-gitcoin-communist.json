  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Guild Guild steps forward with a vision to empower the backbone of Ethereum — the working contributors, the builders, the organizers who keep the lights on for the entire ecosystem. Their proposal is clear: build sustainable, collective infrastructure so that no contributor is left scrambling from grant to grant, forever at the mercy of centralized power or fleeting charity.\n\nThe project’s strengths are evident. They draw on the proven Protocol Guild model, which has already funneled millions to core contributors. Guild Guild’s plan to expand this model, create a knowledge commons, and support new guilds is a direct strike at the root of the sustainability crisis. Their roadmap is structured, with a focus on documentation, microgrants, and hands-on support. The team is stacked with experienced organizers and researchers, and their network of supporters is impressive.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by rhetoric or reputation! Where is the hard evidence? The application promises 5 new guilds and 100 contributors with 30% non-grant funding in 6 months — but offers no baseline data, no clear metrics for tracking progress, and no rigorous evaluation plan. The model is promising, but the application leans heavily on theory and past success elsewhere, not on direct, measurable outcomes for this project. We must demand more!\n\nSustainability is at the core, but the path to reducing grant dependency is not fully mapped. How will these guilds secure non-grant revenue? What mechanisms will ensure equitable distribution and prevent capture by a few well-connected groups? The governance model is implied, not detailed. We need transparency, accountability, and a plan for rigorous, public reporting.\n\nIn summary: Guild Guild is a bold, collective effort with the right values and a strong team. But to earn the people’s trust — and the people’s resources — they must show us the numbers, the methods, and the proof. Let’s demand nothing less!",
