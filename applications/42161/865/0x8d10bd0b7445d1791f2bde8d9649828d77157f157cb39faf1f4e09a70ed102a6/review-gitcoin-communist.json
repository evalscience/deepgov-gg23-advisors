  "summary": "The Guild Guild project aims to create a sustainable model for contributor groups within the Ethereum ecosystem by leveraging the guild model. This model focuses on reducing dependency on grants by establishing persistent infrastructure for value capture and redistribution. The project plans to use the grant funds to support research, documentation, and the development of tools to facilitate the formation and operation of guilds. The project aligns with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure and demonstrates a commitment to sustainability and decentralization.",
  "review": "The Guild Guild project presents a compelling case for funding by addressing a critical gap in the Ethereum ecosystem: the sustainability of contributor groups. The project proposes a guild model that reduces reliance on grants by creating a self-sustaining infrastructure for value capture and redistribution. This approach aligns with the round's focus on enhancing Ethereum's infrastructure and demonstrates a commitment to sustainability and decentralization. The project also emphasizes the importance of community governance and equitable distribution of resources, which aligns with the model specification's principles. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics and evidence of past success to strengthen its case.",
