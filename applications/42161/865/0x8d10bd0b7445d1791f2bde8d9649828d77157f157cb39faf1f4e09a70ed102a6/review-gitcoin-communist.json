  "summary": "The Guild Guild project aims to create a sustainable model for contributor groups within the Ethereum ecosystem by leveraging the guild model. This model focuses on reducing dependency on grants by establishing persistent infrastructure for value capture and redistribution. The project plans to use the grant funds to document successful guild patterns, develop a knowledge commons, distribute microgrants, and support emerging guilds. The project aligns with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure, particularly through its emphasis on sustainability and decentralized coordination.",
  "review": "The Guild Guild project presents a compelling case for funding by addressing a critical gap in the Ethereum ecosystem: the sustainability of contributor groups. The project proposes a guild model that reduces reliance on grants by creating a self-sustaining infrastructure for value capture and redistribution. This approach aligns well with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure, particularly through its emphasis on sustainability and decentralized coordination. The project also demonstrates a commitment to open-source principles and ethical standards, as required by the round's eligibility criteria. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics and evidence of past successes to strengthen its case further.",
