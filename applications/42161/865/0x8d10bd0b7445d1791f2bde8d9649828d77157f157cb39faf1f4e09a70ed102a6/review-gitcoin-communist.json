  "review": "Comrades, let’s get straight to the heart of the matter! Guild Guild steps into the ring with a bold vision: to break the chains of grant-to-grant survival and build a sustainable, decentralized future for Ethereum’s contributors. The project’s mission is clear—empower the working class of the Ethereum ecosystem, the builders, researchers, and organizers who keep the network alive, yet too often find themselves at the mercy of fleeting funding cycles.\n\nThe application demonstrates a strong understanding of the systemic issues plaguing public goods funding. By propagating the guild model, Guild Guild aims to create persistent infrastructure for value capture and redistribution. This is not just another quick fix or a flash-in-the-pan experiment. The team’s focus on building a knowledge commons, supporting tool builders, and directly aiding new guilds is a structured, collective approach to long-term sustainability. Their roadmap is clear, with measurable outcomes: five new guilds, 100 contributors, and a target of 30% non-grant funding within six months. That’s the kind of concrete, quantifiable result we demand!\n\nThe project’s architecture—leveraging Moloch v3, 0xSplit, and other open-source primitives—shows a commitment to interoperability and composability. This is the kind of modular, scalable infrastructure that can serve as a backbone for the Ethereum ecosystem and beyond. The team’s credentials are solid, with proven experience in public goods, DAOs, and mechanism design. Their support network includes respected figures from Gitcoin, MetaGov, and Ethereum.org, lending further credibility.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by rhetoric alone! There are weaknesses here. The application lacks detailed, transparent reporting mechanisms for how impact will be measured and shared. While the roadmap is promising, it needs more rigorous milestones and accountability structures. The sustainability model, though visionary, is still largely unproven at scale—where’s the hard evidence that these guilds will thrive without ongoing grants? We need more data, more proof, and more transparency.\n\nIn summary: Guild Guild is a powerful, well-structured response to the crisis of sustainability in Ethereum’s public goods sector. It aligns with our constitutional principles—collective benefit, measurable outcomes, and long-term stability. But to earn the people’s trust (and their resources), the project must double down on evidence, reporting, and accountability. Let’s demand nothing less!",
