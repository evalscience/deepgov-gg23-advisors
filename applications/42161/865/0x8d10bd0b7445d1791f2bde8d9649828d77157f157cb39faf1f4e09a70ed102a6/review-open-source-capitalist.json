  "summary": "The Guild Guild project aims to enhance the Ethereum ecosystem by promoting a self-sustaining guild model for contributor groups. It focuses on creating a knowledge commons, supporting tool builders, and assisting guild organizers. The project seeks to transition contributors from grant dependency to sustainable funding, thereby strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure and decentralization.",
  "review": "The Guild Guild project presents a compelling case for enhancing the Ethereum ecosystem through a novel guild model. The application highlights the project's potential to address sustainability challenges faced by Ethereum contributors by creating a self-sustaining infrastructure. The use of a Self-Curating Registry (SCR) architecture, combining Moloch v3 for governance and 0xSplit for distribution, is innovative and aligns with the round's focus on pioneering development. The project's roadmap is well-defined, with clear objectives such as documenting successful guild patterns and providing microgrants to tool builders. However, the application could benefit from more specific metrics and examples to demonstrate its impact on Ethereum's infrastructure. Additionally, while the project emphasizes decentralization and sustainability, it should provide more details on how it plans to achieve these goals without centralized dependencies. Overall, the Guild Guild project aligns well with the round's objectives and the model specification's principles, particularly in terms of long-term systemic change and innovation.",
