  "summary": "Guild Guild is an innovative project aimed at enhancing the sustainability of contributor groups within the Ethereum ecosystem by implementing a guild model. This model focuses on reducing dependency on grants by creating persistent infrastructure for value capture and redistribution. The project plans to use the grant funds to support research, develop a knowledge commons, distribute microgrants, and provide direct support to forming guilds. The project aligns with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure and demonstrates potential for significant impact through its pioneering approach to self-organization and funding sustainability.",
  "review": "The Guild Guild project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's objectives of enhancing Ethereum's infrastructure. The project addresses a critical issue in the ecosystem: the sustainability of contributor groups that often rely on grant-to-grant survival. By implementing a guild model, the project aims to create a more sustainable funding flow, reducing dependency on temporary funding mechanisms. The use of a Self-Curating Registry (SCR) architecture, combining Moloch v3 for governance and 0xSplit for distribution, showcases a pioneering approach to interoperability and governance within the Ethereum ecosystem. The project's roadmap is well-defined, focusing on research, knowledge sharing, and direct support to emerging guilds, which could significantly strengthen the ecosystem's resilience and security. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics and examples of past successes to better demonstrate its potential impact and scalability.",
