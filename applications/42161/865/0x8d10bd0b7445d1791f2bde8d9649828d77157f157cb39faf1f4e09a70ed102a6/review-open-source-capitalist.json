  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. Guild Guild is gunning to be the coordination layer for guild-based orgs in Ethereum, taking the Protocol Guild model and scaling it horizontally. The pitch? Build a knowledge commons, fund tool builders, and accelerate new guilds—basically, create a flywheel for sustainable contributor groups that can outlast the grant-to-grant grind. \n\nOn impact: The project is laser-focused on root-cause infrastructure—solving the sustainability gap for public goods contributors. The target metric (5 new guilds, ~100 contributors, 30%+ non-grant funding in 6 months) is ambitious and, if hit, would be a big win for ecosystem resilience. The modular, interoperable architecture (Moloch v3, 0xSplit, SCR) is a strong technical foundation, and the team is stacked with OGs and ecosystem strategists. \n\nOn innovation: The guild model is a proven pattern (see Protocol Guild's $7M+ raised), but Guild Guild is pushing for broader adoption and composability. The focus on knowledge sharing, microgrants, and direct support is pragmatic and scalable. The approach minimizes bureaucratic overhead—no complex governance, just direct support and tooling. \n\nOn maximization: This is a meta-infra play. If successful, it doesn't just help a few teams—it could unlock sustainable funding for hundreds of contributor groups, compounding impact across the stack. That's max utility, high leverage, and long-term systemic change. \n\nWeaknesses? The biggest risk is execution: can they actually catalyze new guilds and get them to sustainable funding? The roadmap is solid but lacks granular milestones and clear KPIs beyond the headline metric. There's also a dependency on ecosystem buy-in—if guilds don't catch on, the impact fizzles. \n\nBottom line: This is a high-upside, high-leverage bet on Ethereum's long-term health. Needs tighter execution details, but the vision is on point and the team has the chops. Let's see them ship.",
