  "summary": "The Guild Guild project aims to enhance the Ethereum ecosystem by creating a sustainable funding model for contributor groups through the guild model. This model reduces reliance on grants by establishing persistent infrastructure for value capture and redistribution. The project focuses on building a knowledge commons, supporting tool builders, and assisting guild organizers. It promises to create new guilds with significant non-grant funding within six months, contributing to the decentralization and security of Ethereum.",
  "review": "The Guild Guild project presents a compelling case for enhancing the Ethereum ecosystem's sustainability by addressing the funding challenges faced by contributor groups. The project leverages the guild model, which has proven successful in aggregating substantial funding for Ethereum core contributors. By focusing on reducing coordination costs and creating persistent infrastructure, the project aligns well with the round's goals of strengthening Ethereum's foundational infrastructure. The project's roadmap is clear, with a focus on documentation, microgrants, and direct support, which are crucial for the successful implementation of the guild model. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics and examples of past successes to strengthen its case.",
