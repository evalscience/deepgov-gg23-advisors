  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. Guild Guild is gunning to be the mycelial network for Ethereum contributor sustainability—think Protocol Guild, but modular, extensible, and aiming for mass adoption. The project’s core thesis is that by lowering coordination costs and making the guild model plug-and-play, you unlock a multiplier effect for public goods funding and contributor retention. That’s a big swing, and it’s the kind of systemic play that fits the round’s focus on foundational infrastructure.\n\nStrengths? The team’s got serious cred—builders and researchers with deep roots in the Ethereum ecosystem. The model is proven in the wild (Protocol Guild’s $7M+ haul is no joke), and Guild Guild’s roadmap is all about scaling that success: knowledge commons, builder microgrants, and a guild accelerator. The target metric—5 new guilds, 100 contributors, 30% non-grant funding in 6 months—is ambitious but not vaporware. The modular architecture (Moloch v3, 0xSplit, SCR) is interoperable and composable, which is exactly what you want for infra that needs to scale.\n\nBut let’s not get lost in the hype. There are some weak spots. The application is heavy on vision, light on hard implementation details. There’s no granular breakdown of how funds will be allocated across research, microgrants, and direct support. The impact metrics are solid, but there’s no clear plan for how progress will be measured or reported. Also, while the guild model is promising, the application doesn’t address potential risks—like governance capture, fragmentation, or the challenge of onboarding less technical contributor groups. Finally, the project’s reliance on ecosystem support is strong, but there’s no contingency plan if that support wavers.\n\nRequested changes: I want to see a detailed budget and fund allocation plan. Give me a concrete impact measurement framework—how will you track and report on those 5 guilds and 100 contributors? Address the risks: what’s the plan if guilds fragment or fail to reach sustainability? And finally, outline how you’ll onboard non-technical or underrepresented groups—max utility means max inclusion, even if it’s not the main focus.\n\nBottom line: This is a high-potential, high-leverage play for Ethereum’s contributor infrastructure. The vision is big, the team is legit, but the execution plan needs more meat. Tighten up the details, and you’re looking at a serious contender for max impact funding.",
