  "summary": "Guild Guild is a project aimed at enhancing the sustainability of contributor groups within the Ethereum ecosystem by promoting a guild model of self-organization. This model seeks to reduce reliance on grant funding by creating persistent infrastructure for value capture and redistribution. The project focuses on building a knowledge commons, supporting tool builders, and assisting guild organizers. It aims to foster decentralized coordination, thereby strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure and security.",
  "review": "The Guild Guild project presents a compelling case for enhancing the sustainability of contributor groups within the Ethereum ecosystem. By adopting a guild model, the project aims to reduce the dependency on grant funding, which aligns with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's foundational infrastructure. The project demonstrates significant potential in contributing to the Ethereum network's infrastructure by proposing a self-curating registry and splitter model that enhances interoperability and user experience. The project's roadmap is well-defined, focusing on documentation, microgrants, and direct support to emerging guilds, which could lead to a more resilient and decentralized Ethereum ecosystem. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics and examples of past successes to substantiate its claims. Additionally, while the project outlines a broad impact beyond Ethereum, it should provide clearer strategies for achieving these goals. Overall, the Guild Guild project aligns well with the round's objectives and the model specification's principles, particularly in fostering innovation, community participation, and systemic change.",
