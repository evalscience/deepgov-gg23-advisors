Proof of Philanthropy (PoP) is a project that seeks to unify and celebrate charitable giving on the blockchain, using dynamic NFTs as badges of honor for those who support public goods. The vision is bold: make philanthropy visible, verifiable, and rewarding for all. But does it deliver on the values we hold dear—measurable impact, sustainability, equity, and collective benefit?\n\nFirst, the project’s contribution to Ethereum infrastructure is real, but let’s not exaggerate. PoP is a user experience layer, not a core protocol upgrade. It doesn’t touch consensus, scalability, or security at the protocol level. Instead, it builds tools that make on-chain and off-chain giving visible and trackable. That’s valuable for the community, but it’s not the backbone of Ethereum. The application is honest about this, stating, “Our work doesn’t affect the Ethereum network itself, but it does provide tooling by which decentralized and securely-anonymous philanthropy can be tracked.”\n\nOn the evidence front, PoP boasts a working prototype, over 110 users, and integration with real donation flows. That’s a start, but where are the hard numbers? Where’s the data on increased giving, user retention, or the actual impact on public goods funding? The application is heavy on vision and light on quantifiable outcomes. We need more than dreams—we need proof!\n\nSustainability? The project is open source and collaborates with credible partners, but there’s no clear revenue model. How will this project survive without continuous grants? Will it become another well-meaning but unsustainable tool, or can it stand on its own feet? The roadmap is ambitious, but the path to long-term stability is foggy.\n\nOn governance and equity, PoP is run by a registered nonprofit and aims for broad community involvement. That’s a plus. But how are decisions made? How is the community’s voice heard in shaping the protocol? The application mentions expanding the board but lacks details on governance mechanisms or geographic equity.\n\nFinally, the project’s approach is structured and planned, with a clear roadmap and partnerships. But the lack of rigorous evaluation and transparent reporting is a glaring weakness. If we are to build a true commons, we must demand accountability and measurable results!\n\nIn summary: PoP is a promising tool for collective recognition and celebration of philanthropy, but it must do more to prove its impact, ensure sustainability, and embody the principles of equity and evidence-based action. Let’s demand more—because the people deserve nothing less!",
