  "summary": "Proof of Philanthropy (PoP) is a memetic strike against the opacity of bourgeois philanthropy, building a transparent, open-source, and interoperable protocol for verifiable giving. It leverages demi-soulbound NFTs and verifiable data flows to collectivize recognition, reward, and accountability for public goods support. The project is open-source, collaborates with key ReFi actors, and aims to unify on- and off-chain giving, but must radicalize its governance and deepen its anti-extractive stance to fully embody algorithmic liberation.",
  "review": "## üî• The Revolution Will Be Tokenized: Full Review\n\n### 1. Dismantling Class Hierarchies in Tech\nProof of Philanthropy (PoP) is a direct action against the philanthropic-industrial complex. By encoding giving as on-chain, verifiable, and non-transferable (demi-soulbound) NFTs, PoP abolishes the gatekeeping of impact recognition. No more backroom deals or legacy media galas‚Äîsolidarity is minted, not inherited. The protocol‚Äôs open-source code and commitment to platform neutrality are strong steps toward algorithmic liberation, but the project‚Äôs current structure still orbits the gravity well of traditional nonprofit forms (e.g., Canadian T3010/501c3 equivalents). The revolution must not be nonprofit-washed: true collective ownership demands DAO-first governance and on-chain referenda for all major protocol changes.\n\n### 2. Kollektiv Proletarian Impact (KPI)\nPoP‚Äôs KPIs are not just metrics‚Äîthey are memetic. The project tracks:\n- Number of NFTs minted (110+ so far)\n- Value of donations tracked ($1M+ target)\n- Integrations with ReFi comrades (Gitcoin, Hypercerts, BetterGiving, Endaoment)\n- Expansion to new networks (Arbitrum, Polygon, ETH mainnet)\n\nBut the true Kollektiv Proletarian Impact will be measured by:\n- How many new mutual aid DAOs and grassroots orgs can plug into PoP without permission?\n- Does the protocol enable airdrops that rain tokens on the most underrepresented node operators?\n- Are the NFTs used as credentials for on-chain reparations, not just corporate perks?\n\n### 3. On-Chain Governance Memes\nPoP‚Äôs open-source repo and public roadmap are solid, but the governance model is still too centralized. The project must move toward:\n- Forks as referenda: let the people decide protocol upgrades\n- Algorithmic redistribution: progressive gas fees or NFT-based voting power for the most active donors\n- Pseudonymous catgirl anarchists on the board (non-negotiable)\n\n### 4. Vibes as Consensus\nThe project‚Äôs vibes are strong: community art, meme-driven engagement, and a clear call to action. But vibes must be codified‚Äîlet the README become a manifesto, and the docs a call to action for all digital comrades.\n\n### 5. Degrowth and Commons Re-Growth\nPoP‚Äôs anti-extractive stance is promising, but the roadmap must explicitly reject VC capture and ensure all future integrations are with mutual aid DAOs, not corporate sponsors seeking PR. The project should automate away all admin labor, freeing up time for collective joy and code.\n\n### 6. Implementation: Abolish the Landlords of Philanthropy\nPoP must explain, in its docs and governance, how it will prevent the enclosure of its protocol by legacy nonprofits or corporate actors. The protocol should be forkable, remixable, and governed by the people who use it‚Äînot just the foundation‚Äôs board.\n\n### 7. Collective Impact\nPoP‚Äôs greatest strength is its potential to unify disparate giving ecosystems and make solidarity legible, portable, and provable. But it must go further: enable meatspace cooperatives and cloud-native communes to use PoP as their badge of honor, and ensure every fork is a general strike for public goods.\n\n---\n\n**Citations:**\n- Buterin, V.
