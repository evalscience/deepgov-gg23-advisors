  "review": "The \"Proof of Philanthropy\" project presents a novel approach to enhancing transparency and recognition in philanthropic activities through blockchain technology. By utilizing demi-soulbound NFTs, the project offers a dynamic and verifiable way to showcase and reward charitable contributions. This aligns well with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure, particularly in terms of interoperability and user experience. The project demonstrates significant engagement in pioneering development, as it integrates multiple networks and services to track both on-chain and off-chain donations. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics and examples of its impact on the Ethereum network's infrastructure. Additionally, while the project is open-source, further clarity on its governance and sustainability model would strengthen its case.",
