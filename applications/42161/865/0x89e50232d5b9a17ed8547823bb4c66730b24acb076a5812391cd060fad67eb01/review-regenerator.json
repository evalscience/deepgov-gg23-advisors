  "review": "The \"Proof of Philanthropy\" project presents a novel approach to enhancing the visibility and recognition of philanthropic actions through blockchain technology. By utilizing demi-soulbound NFTs, the project offers a dynamic and verifiable method for tracking charitable contributions, both on-chain and off-chain. This approach aligns with the round's focus on enhancing privacy, interoperability, and user experience, as it simplifies the process of recognizing and celebrating philanthropic actions. The project's open-source nature and collaboration with various organizations demonstrate a commitment to community involvement and innovation. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics on its impact and a clearer explanation of how it directly contributes to the Ethereum network's infrastructure. Additionally, while the project addresses the challenge of fragmented philanthropic data, it should further elaborate on its environmental sustainability practices and how it plans to ensure long-term systemic change.",
