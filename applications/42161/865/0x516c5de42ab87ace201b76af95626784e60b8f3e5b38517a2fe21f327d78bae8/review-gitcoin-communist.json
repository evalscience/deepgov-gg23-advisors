  "review": "Comrades, let’s get straight to the heart of the matter! Monas claims to be building a protocol for true user data sovereignty—an ambitious goal that, if realized, could shift the balance of power in the Ethereum ecosystem. The project’s vision is clear: empower users, protect privacy, and bridge the gap between on-chain transparency and off-chain privacy. But does Monas deliver on the promises that our movement demands? Let’s break it down, brick by brick.\n\nFirst, Monas addresses a real, pressing need: Ethereum’s transparency is a double-edged sword, making it unfit for sensitive data. Monas proposes a solution—separating content from state, using a decentralized state management network (with CRDTs) and an encrypted data structure for access control. This is not just technical jargon; it’s a direct response to the community’s call for privacy and control. The project’s open-source ethos and commitment to decentralization are in line with our core values.\n\nHowever, the application falls short where it matters most: evidence and measurement. Where are the metrics? Where is the proof that Monas works at scale, or that it’s more than a prototype? The roadmap is detailed, but the outcomes are not quantified. There’s mention of a prototype and hackathon participation, but no hard data on adoption, performance, or impact. The project is still in early development, with the first SDK release only just planned. This is not enough for a movement that demands results, not just promises.\n\nOn sustainability, Monas is silent. There’s no mention of a revenue model, long-term funding plan, or how the project will avoid the endless cycle of grant dependency. This is a red flag! We cannot build a people’s infrastructure on hope alone—we need sustainable systems that can stand the test of time.\n\nGovernance and equity? The project is open-source and peer-to-peer, but there’s no detail on community governance, decision-making, or how Monas will ensure equitable access and benefit. Who holds the keys? Who sets the rules? The people must know!\n\nIn summary: Monas is bold, visionary, and technically promising. But it must do more to earn the people’s trust. Show us the numbers. Show us the plan for sustainability. Show us how the community will govern and benefit. Only then can we say this project truly serves the commons!",
