  "summary": "Monas is a protocol designed to enhance user data sovereignty by integrating privacy, interoperability, and user control within the Ethereum ecosystem. It introduces innovative components like a state management network and an encrypted data structure for access control, aiming to bridge off-chain and on-chain environments while maintaining data authenticity and privacy. The project is in active development, with a roadmap leading to a first release in June 2025.",
  "review": "The Monas project presents a compelling vision for enhancing user data sovereignty within the Ethereum ecosystem. It addresses significant challenges related to privacy and data management by introducing a decentralized state management network and an encrypted data structure for access control. These innovations are aligned with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure, particularly in terms of privacy and interoperability. The project's roadmap is well-structured, with clear phases leading to a first release in June 2025. However, the application lacks specific metrics or examples of current impact, which would strengthen its case for funding. Additionally, the absence of deployer addresses for smart contracts is a notable omission, as it limits the ability to verify the project's current deployment status.",
