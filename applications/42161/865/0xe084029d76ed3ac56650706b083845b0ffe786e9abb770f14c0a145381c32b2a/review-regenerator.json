  "summary": "The Opti.Domains project aims to scale Ethereum Name Service (ENS) to the Optimism network, enhancing interoperability and user experience by simplifying the management of ENS domains across Layer 2 (L2) solutions. The project introduces a CCIP Gateway that adapts to changes in the L2OutputOracle migration without downtime, supporting multiple Superchain registrations with a single deployment. The grant will be used for maintaining the gateway and outreach efforts.",
  "review": "The Opti.Domains project presents a compelling case for enhancing the Ethereum network's infrastructure by addressing the challenge of managing ENS domains on Layer 2 solutions. The project introduces an innovative CCIP Gateway that ensures seamless migration and management of ENS domains across the Optimism network, which is a significant contribution to the Ethereum ecosystem. The project's focus on interoperability and user experience aligns well with the round's objectives of supporting foundational infrastructure and pioneering development. However, the application lacks detailed metrics or evidence of current impact, which would strengthen its case. Additionally, the roadmap for the use of grant funds is vague, focusing primarily on maintenance and outreach without specific milestones or deliverables. The project could benefit from a more detailed plan outlining how the grant will directly contribute to its development goals and impact on the Ethereum network.",
