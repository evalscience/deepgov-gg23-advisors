  "review": "Brothers and sisters, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Opti.Domains claims to be scaling ENS to Optimism, breaking down the barriers that keep identity locked on Ethereum mainnet. That’s a noble cause—identity is power, and power belongs in the hands of the people, not the privileged few!\n\nLet’s look at the evidence. The project has contributed directly to the ENS Official OP CCIP Gateway, with a public pull request and forum discussion to back it up. That’s transparency and real, measurable work. Their CCIP Gateway innovation—handling L2OutputOracle migration and supporting multiple Superchain registrations with a single contract—shows technical prowess and a commitment to minimizing downtime. That’s the kind of infrastructure work that keeps the Ethereum ecosystem strong and resilient.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by rhetoric. Where’s the data? Where are the metrics showing adoption, usage, or impact? The application is light on hard numbers. We need to see how many users are benefiting, how many domains are managed, and what real-world problems are being solved at scale. Without this, we’re left with promises, not proof.\n\nThe roadmap is vague—\"maintain the gateway and more outreach\" is not a plan, it’s a slogan. We demand specifics! How will funds be used? What milestones will be achieved? The people deserve accountability!\n\nOn sustainability, there’s no mention of a revenue model or long-term funding plan. Will this project stand on its own, or will it be back, hat in hand, for more donations? We need sustainable systems, not endless dependency.\n\nIn terms of governance and equity, the project promotes identity adoption across the Superchain, which is a step toward collective benefit. But there’s no detail on community governance, geographic equity, or how underserved populations will be reached. We need more than good intentions—we need action!\n\nIn summary: Opti.Domains is doing important work, but the application lacks the hard evidence, structured planning, and sustainability that our movement demands. Show us the numbers, the plan, and the path to independence! Only then can we build a future where tech serves the many, not the few.",
