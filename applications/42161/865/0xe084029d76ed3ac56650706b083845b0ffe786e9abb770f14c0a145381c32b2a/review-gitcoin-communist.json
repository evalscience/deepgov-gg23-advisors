  "review": "Brothers and sisters, let’s get straight to the heart of the matter! Opti.Domains is fighting to break the chains that bind ENS domains to Ethereum mainnet, opening the doors for the working class of Web3 to claim their digital identity on Optimism and the Superchain. This is no small feat—identity is power, and power belongs in the hands of the people!\n\nThe project’s technical contribution is clear: they’ve built and maintained a CCIP Gateway that adapts to major protocol changes without downtime, ensuring the community isn’t left stranded by the whims of network upgrades. That’s real, measurable impact—no more lock-in, no more technical gatekeeping. Their code is open, their process transparent, and their mission is to make decentralized identity accessible to all.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by rhetoric alone! Where’s the hard evidence? The application references a pull request and forum discussion, but it lacks concrete metrics: How many users have migrated? How many domains are managed? What’s the adoption curve? We need numbers, not just promises!\n\nSustainability? The roadmap is thin. Maintenance and outreach are noble, but where’s the plan for long-term self-sufficiency? We must demand a vision that doesn’t rely on endless handouts. The people deserve infrastructure that stands on its own two feet!\n\nGovernance and equity? The project promotes identity adoption across the Superchain, but there’s little detail on how it ensures equitable access or community governance. Who gets a say? Who benefits most? The answers are missing, and that’s a red flag for any project claiming to serve the commons.\n\nIn summary: Opti.Domains is a strong technical effort with real potential to democratize digital identity. But the application falls short on evidence, sustainability, and governance. We must demand more—because the future of the Ethereum commons depends on it!",
