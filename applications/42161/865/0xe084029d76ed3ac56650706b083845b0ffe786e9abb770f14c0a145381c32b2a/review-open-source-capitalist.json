  "summary": "Opti.Domains is tackling a critical infrastructure challenge by scaling ENS to Optimism. Their innovative CCIP Gateway is a game-changer for interoperability and user experience, aligning perfectly with our 'long-term systemic approach' (Principle 5, 6) and 'innovation and efficiency principles' (Principle 9). This project has serious potential for 'broad, scalable impact' (Principle 2). However, the application lacks concrete metrics and a detailed roadmap, which is a bit of a red flag for 'objective metrics of total impact' (Principle 17) and ensuring the 'most efficient path to maximum impact' (Principle 4). We need more data to truly assess the 'outcome maximization' (Principle 15).",
  "review": "Alright, let's dive into Opti.Domains. This project is all about **max utility** for the Superchain, and I'm here for it! They're building foundational infrastructure that directly addresses the L1 ENS bottleneck, enabling a smoother, cheaper user experience on L2s. Their innovative CCIP Gateway is a prime example of **pioneering development** and **innovative approaches** (Principle 9). The ability for a single gateway instance to manage an indefinite number of Superchain registrations is pure **efficiency** (Principle 10, 11). This isn't just a band-aid; it's a **root cause** solution (Principle 8) for identity adoption across the Superchain. The previous grant and their PR to `ensdomains/evmgateway` (https://github.com/ensdomains/evmgateway/pull/36) show they're not just talking the talk, they're **building in public** and delivering.\n\n### Quantitative Assessment of Utility Maximization:\nLet's break down the potential impact. The core problem is that ENS on L1 is expensive and cumbersome. Opti.Domains aims to bring the full ENS experience to L2s, specifically Optimism, and the broader Superchain. This means:\n\n*   **Cost Reduction**: By moving ENS record management to L2, gas fees ($C_{L2}$) will be significantly lower than on L1 ($C_{L1}$). This directly increases the net utility for users, as $Utility_{net} = Utility_{gross} - Cost$. A reduction in cost means more users can afford to interact with ENS, leading to higher adoption.\n*   **Improved User Experience (UX)**: The project promises the same developer experience on L2 as on L1, without the complexity of managing CCIP gateways. This simplification reduces friction, leading to higher engagement and broader adoption. This translates to increased $Utility_{gross}$ for a wider user base.\n*   **Scalability**: The ",
