  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. Opti.Domains is gunning to scale ENS (Ethereum Name Service) to Optimism and the broader Superchain. That's a big play in the Web3 infrastructure game, especially post-fault proof merge, where a lot of legacy implementations got rekt. Their CCIP Gateway is designed to be future-proof, handling L2OutputOracle migrations and DisputeGame changes with zero downtime—no need to redeploy contracts every time the ground shifts. That's a serious boost to uptime and developer sanity.\n\nOn the impact front, they're not just patching holes—they're building a bridge for ENS to thrive on L2s, which is a major unlock for user experience and dev onboarding. The ability to manage ENS records on Optimism and other Superchain chains without wrestling with CCIP gateways is a big win for composability and scaling. This is the kind of infra that quietly powers the next wave of dapps and user adoption.\n\nBut let's not get too starry-eyed. The application is light on hard metrics—no user numbers, adoption stats, or concrete KPIs. The roadmap is vague: \"maintain the gateway and more outreach\" is not a plan, it's a tweet. For a project with this much potential, I want to see a clear, measurable path to impact. Also, while the tech is innovative, there's not much detail on privacy enhancements or how this specifically boosts decentralization and security beyond \"promoting identity adoption.\"\n\nBottom line: killer potential, but needs more meat on the bones. Show me the numbers, the milestones, and the real-world traction. Then we're talking max utility, not just max hype.",
