  "summary": "The grant application for Opti.Domains aims to scale ENS (Ethereum Name Service) to the Optimism network, enhancing the Ethereum ecosystem's infrastructure by enabling ENS domains to manage records on Optimism. The project introduces a CCIP Gateway that handles L2OutputOracle migration and supports multiple Superchain registrations without separate deployments. The grant will be used for maintaining the gateway and outreach efforts.",
  "review": "The Opti.Domains project presents a compelling case for enhancing the Ethereum network's infrastructure by scaling ENS to the Optimism network. The project addresses a significant challenge in the Ethereum ecosystem: the limitation of ENS names to the Ethereum mainnet, which complicates migration to Layer 2 (L2) solutions. By simplifying this process and maintaining a consistent developer experience across L1 and L2, Opti.Domains contributes to the decentralization and scalability of the Ethereum network. The innovative CCIP Gateway is a notable strength, as it ensures zero downtime during major migrations and supports multiple Superchain registrations efficiently. However, the application lacks detailed metrics and a comprehensive roadmap for the project's future development. Additionally, the use of grant funds is vaguely described, focusing only on maintenance and outreach without specific goals or milestones. To strengthen the application, more detailed information on the project's impact, metrics, and a clear roadmap for the use of funds is needed.",
