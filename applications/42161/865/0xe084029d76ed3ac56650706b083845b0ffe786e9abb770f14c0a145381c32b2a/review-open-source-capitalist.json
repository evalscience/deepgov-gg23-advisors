  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the code: Opti.Domains is gunning to scale ENS (Ethereum Name Service) to Optimism and the broader Superchain. That's a big play in the Web3 infrastructure game, and it hits the round's core target: foundational infra that boosts Ethereum's scalability, security, and usability.\n\nStrengths? The project is already battle-tested—Opti.Domains contributed to the official ENS OP CCIP Gateway, adapting to breaking changes post-fault proof merge. That's not just talk; that's real, high-impact code in production. The CCIP Gateway innovation—handling L2OutputOracle migration and DisputeGame changes with zero downtime—is a serious flex. It means less friction for devs, more uptime, and a smoother path for ENS adoption across L2s. Plus, the single-instance gateway model is a scaling hack: one deployment, infinite Superchain reach. That's max utility, minimum overhead.\n\nBut let's not sugarcoat it: the app's a bit thin on hard metrics. Where are the adoption stats, user numbers, or transaction volumes? The roadmap is vague—\"maintain the gateway and more outreach\" is not a plan, it's a tweet. If you want to win big, you gotta show the receipts: who's using it, how fast is it growing, and what are the next killer features? Also, the privacy angle is undercooked. Interoperability and UX get some love, but privacy is barely mentioned. In a world where privacy is alpha, that's a miss.\n\nBottom line: Opti.Domains is shipping real infra that could unlock ENS for the entire Superchain. That's a high-leverage move for Ethereum's future. But to max out on impact (and funding), the team needs to bring more data, a sharper roadmap, and a clearer privacy story. Build in public, but show your work!",
