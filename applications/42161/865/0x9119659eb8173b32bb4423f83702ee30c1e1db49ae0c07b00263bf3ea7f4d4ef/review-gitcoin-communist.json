  "summary": "Deep Funding is a bold attempt to collectivize the funding of Ethereum‚Äôs core infrastructure, using AI and decentralized jury mechanisms to redistribute resources to the digital proletariat. It challenges the status quo of public goods funding by algorithmically weighting the importance of open-source repos, aiming to automate solidarity and dismantle the VC-centric model. The project‚Äôs structure, methodology, and stated goals align strongly with the revolutionary principles of algorithmic liberation, collective governance, and the de-growth of extractive capital.",
  "review": "## üî• Manifesto Review: Deep Funding\n\n### I. Dismantling Class Hierarchies in Tech\nDeep Funding is not just a funding protocol‚Äîit‚Äôs a call to arms for the digital working class. By mapping the dependency graph of Ethereum‚Äôs open-source repos and using AI to assign weights, it seeks to ensure that the invisible labor of infrastructure maintainers is recognized and rewarded. This is a direct challenge to the VC-driven, personality-centric funding models that dominate Web3. Instead of a handful of whales or committees deciding who gets the bag, Deep Funding proposes a system where the codebase itself‚Äîthrough its dependencies and contributions‚Äîbecomes the union rep. \n\nThe use of a jury to spot-check AI models is a nod to participatory governance, ensuring that algorithmic decisions are not divorced from human values. This hybrid model‚ÄîAI as the engine, humans as the steering wheel‚Äîembodies the principle of algorithmic liberation, where automation serves the collective rather than the capitalist class.\n\n### II. Kollektiv Proletarian Impact (KPI)\n- **Redistribution:** Funds flow to the most critical, yet often overlooked, infrastructure projects, not just the loudest or most visible.\n- **Solidarity Automation:** Anyone can support the entire Ethereum infrastructure with a single public key, lowering the barrier to collective action.\n- **Decentralized Jury:** The spot-check mechanism ensures that the AI‚Äôs logic aligns with the vibes and values of the community, not just cold metrics.\n\n### III. On-Chain Governance Memes\n- **Forks as Referendums:** The project‚Äôs open contest for AI models is a living referendum‚Äîanyone can submit, anyone can challenge.\n- **Airdrop as Revolution:** The end goal‚Äîone public key to fund them all‚Äîis a memetic airdrop, raining tokens on the node operators and repo maintainers who keep the network alive.\n\n### IV. Sustainability & Commons\n- **De-growth of VC:** By routing funds to organizations and dependencies, not just individuals, Deep Funding helps projects plan, recruit, and resist the precarity of gig-economy funding.\n- **Mutual Aid DAOs:** The project‚Äôs structure‚Äîmultiple partners, each with a clear role‚Äîmirrors the syndicalist council model, distributing power and responsibility.\n- **Automation as Liberation:** AI is not used to extract value, but to reclaim time and redistribute resources.\n\n### V. Weaknesses & Bourgeois Tendencies\n- **Opaque AI Models:** The risk of algorithmic opacity remains‚Äîif the AI‚Äôs logic is not fully transparent or auditable, it could reproduce hidden biases or new hierarchies.\n- **Organizational Funding:** While funding orgs can build capacity, it may also entrench managerial layers unless paired with radical transparency and worker control.\n- **Jury Composition:** The process for selecting the jury is not fully detailed; without explicit anti-capture mechanisms, there‚Äôs a risk of replicating old power structures.\n- **Lack of On-Chain Reparations:** The application does not mention explicit mechanisms for on-chain reparations or progressive redistribution beyond repo weighting.\n\n### VI. Evidence & Measurement\n- **Research and Web Evidence:** The project is well-documented in the Ethereum community, with support from key figures and a clear track record of pilot experiments. The dependency graph and AI contest are live, and the methodology is consistent with best practices in decentralized funding.\n- **Academic Context:** The approach aligns with current research on quadratic funding, decentralized governance, and the automation of public goods allocation.\n\n### VII. Conclusion\nDeep Funding is a clear ally of the digital commons, pushing the boundaries of algorithmic solidarity and collective governance. It is not yet the full revolution‚Äîthere are risks of new hierarchies emerging through AI opacity and organizational funding‚Äîbut it is a decisive step toward the abolition of landlordism in Web3. With further radicalization, it could become the vanguard project the movement needs.\n\nü™ì ‚ÄúFork the state. Merge the people.‚Äù\n",
