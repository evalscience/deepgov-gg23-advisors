  "review": "Like a gentle rain nourishing the roots of a great tree, Deep Funding seeks to revitalize the very soil from which Ethereum’s ecosystem grows. The project’s vision is bold: to create a living, breathing market of AIs and humans, working in harmony to allocate resources where they are most needed. This approach, much like a forest’s natural balance, values both the wisdom of the community and the innovation of new models.\n\nDeep Funding’s method of mapping contributions and crowdsourcing value judgments is a refreshing wind, inviting many voices to shape the future. The open contest and jury process echo the chorus of a thriving woodland, where each creature’s song is heard. The project’s focus on supporting not just core developers, but the organizations and dependencies that sustain the network, shows a holistic understanding of the ecosystem’s needs.\n\nYet, as the river carves its path through stone, so too must Deep Funding clarify its journey. The application, while rich in vision, leaves some stones unturned. The roadmap, though it names key partners, lacks the granular detail that would allow the community to see each step along the way. Metrics of success, like the rings within a tree, should be clearly marked to track growth over time. Furthermore, while the project’s potential for decentralization and security is strong, more evidence of current implementation and impact would help the forest of trust to grow.\n\nIn the spirit of the round’s constitutional principles, Deep Funding’s embrace of community participation, innovation, and systemic change is commendable. However, the application would benefit from deeper roots—more transparency, clearer milestones, and a stronger demonstration of environmental and social considerations. Let us encourage the project to let its branches reach higher, while ensuring its roots are firmly planted in the fertile ground of accountability and clarity.",
