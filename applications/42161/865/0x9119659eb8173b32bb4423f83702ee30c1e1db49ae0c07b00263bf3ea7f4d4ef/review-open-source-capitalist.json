  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get to the core. Deep Funding is gunning to be the turbocharger for Ethereum’s open-source infrastructure, using AI to allocate capital where it matters most. The pitch? Crowdsource model submissions, let a jury spot-check, and use the best-aligned models to distribute funds across 5,000+ repos. That’s a big swing at a systemic problem: underfunded, under-credited core infra. \n\nThe project’s got serious scale potential—if it works, you could one-click fund the entire Ethereum backbone, not just the headline-grabbing devs but the unsung dependencies too. That’s max utility, max impact, and a direct shot at the root cause: funding fragmentation. The AI contest model is spicy—open, competitive, and designed to align with human values, not just raw metrics. That’s innovation with teeth.\n\nBut let’s not get lost in the hype. The roadmap is more of a partner shoutout than a concrete plan. There’s a list of collaborators, but no hard milestones, deliverables, or timelines. The smart contract deployment is still vaporware—\"still in development\" doesn’t cut it for infra funding at this scale. Metrics are light: there’s a leaderboard, but no hard data on actual capital flows, repo impact, or user adoption. And while the project claims to be open source, there’s no direct link to code, audits, or transparency on governance.\n\nBottom line: Deep Funding is swinging for the fences with a high-leverage, high-innovation approach. But to unlock serious capital, they need to show more receipts—clear milestones, real metrics, and working code. Build in public, or risk getting forked by someone who will.\n\nCitations: Application answers (questions 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), project description, round eligibility criteria.",
