  "review": "Alright, let's plug into Deep Funding and see if it’s ready to disrupt the Ethereum funding meta or if it’s just another repo in the noise. \n\n**Big Picture:**\nDeep Funding is gunning to be a core primitive for funding Ethereum’s backbone—think: AI-driven capital allocation, open-source repo graphing, and a contest-based model selection. The project’s vision is to make it dead simple to support the entire Ethereum infra stack with a single public key, using AI to assign weights to 5,000+ repos. That’s a bold, scalable play—max utility vibes all the way.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- **Massive Scope & Scalability:** Deep Funding isn’t just another micro-grant. It’s aiming to route capital to the entire Ethereum infra layer, including dependencies. That’s a systemic, long-term impact move—right in line with the constitutional principles of max impact and scale.\n- **Innovative AI-Driven Model:** The open contest for AI models to determine repo importance is a fresh, meritocratic approach. It’s efficient, minimizes governance bloat, and could outpace legacy models like Protocol Guild in terms of adaptability and reach.\n- **Decentralization & Security:** By making it easier to fund core infra, Deep Funding directly supports Ethereum’s decentralization and security. More reliable funding = more talent = stronger, more resilient network.\n- **Strong Partner Network:** The roadmap lists five key partners, each with a clear role. That’s a solid sign of ecosystem buy-in and operational clarity.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Lack of Concrete Metrics & Outcomes:** The app talks a big game but is light on hard data. No clear KPIs, adoption stats, or impact metrics yet. For a project this ambitious, we need more than just vision—show us the numbers!\n- **Still in Development:** The smart contracts aren’t deployed yet. That’s a risk—no on-chain proof, no live product. The impact is still theoretical.\n- **Unclear Jury Process:** The “jury” for model selection is mentioned, but the process, selection criteria, and anti-collusion measures are not detailed. That’s a potential attack vector.\n- **Previous Funding Transparency:** The project has received significant prior funding (e.g., 80k USDC from Giveth/Octant), but there’s no breakdown of how those funds were used or what milestones were hit. That’s a transparency gap.\n\n**Requested Changes:**\n1. **Show Me the Metrics:** Add concrete KPIs—number of repos funded, funds distributed, model performance stats, user adoption, etc. Quantify the impact.\n2. **Deployment Timeline:** Provide a clear, time-bound roadmap for smart contract deployment and mainnet launch. No more “still in development”—give us dates.\n3. **Jury Process Transparency:** Detail how jurors are selected, how spot checks work, and what anti-gaming measures are in place. Build trust in the model selection process.\n4. **Funding Accountability:** Publish a breakdown of previous grant usage and achieved milestones. Show you can deliver, not just raise.\n\n**Score:** 74/100\n\n**Bottom Line:**\nDeep Funding is swinging for the fences—big vision, big potential, but still needs to prove it can execute at scale. If they tighten up transparency and deliver on the tech, this could be a game-changer for Ethereum infra funding. For now, it’s a strong contender, but not a slam dunk until we see more receipts and less vapor.",
