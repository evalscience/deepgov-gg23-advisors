  "summary": "Militereum, a Web3 firewall, aims to protect users from digital exploitation, a goal that resonates with the core value of **Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation**. Its native application approach and commitment to no telemetry are commendable steps towards **reclaiming time from capitalism using automation and AI** (Principle 7) and safeguarding the digital proletariat. However, the project's use of a GNU AGPL v3.0 with Commons Clause license fundamentally undermines its alignment with **re-growing the commons** (Principle 5) and the revolutionary potential of **forks as democratic referendums** (Principle 13) or **forking code as the new general strike** (Principle 18). This licensing choice introduces a significant contradiction, presenting itself as open-source while restricting true collective ownership and commercial use, thus hindering its overall 'Kollektiv Proletarian Impact' (Principle 2). The README is not yet a manifesto.",
  "review": "Militereum presents itself as a crucial bulwark against the predatory forces that plague the digital frontier, aiming to shield the digital proletariat from the relentless onslaught of phishing, hacks, and rug pulls. This mission, to protect the vulnerable and empower the masses, resonates deeply with the spirit of **Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation**. The project's commitment to a native application, eschewing the 'hostile environment' of browser extensions, is a tactical victory in the ongoing struggle against centralized control and surveillance capitalism. Furthermore, the explicit rejection of telemetry is a bold stance for user privacy, ensuring that the tools of liberation do not become instruments of data extraction.\n\nHowever, the revolution demands more than good intentions; it demands structural alignment. The project's claim of being 'open-source' while operating under a GNU AGPL v3.0 with Commons Clause license is a contradiction that cannot stand. This 'Commons Clause' is a bourgeois tendency, a subtle reinforcement of existing power hierarchies that restricts the free flow of code and prevents true collective ownership. It undermines the very essence of the 'commons' that we seek to re-grow (Principle 5). How can 'code be the union rep' if its terms of service are dictated by a clause that limits its revolutionary potential? How can 'forks be the strike' (Principle 18) if the very act of forking for broader, potentially commercial, collective benefit is constrained?\n\nWhile the project's roadmap includes promising features like a mobile version and AI-driven transaction scanning, the true 'Kollektiv Proletarian Impact' (Principle 2) remains constrained by this licensing choice. The potential for this tool to truly dismantle class hierarchies in tech (Principle 1) is diminished if its foundational code is not freely available for all forms of collective innovation and redistribution. The project's previous milestones, such as partnerships with Revoke.Cash and vaults.fyi, demonstrate a capacity for integration within the broader ecosystem, which could foster a nascent 'cloud-native commune' (Principle 17). Yet, without a truly open foundation, these integrations risk becoming mere interoperability within a walled garden, rather than a truly liberated network.\n\nTo quantify the collective impact, we must consider the friction introduced by the license. Let $L$ be the liberatory potential of the license, where $L=1$ for truly open and $L=0$ for proprietary. Let $S$ be the security impact, and $A$ be the accessibility impact. The true Kollektiv Proletarian Impact (KPI) can be approximated as:\n\n$$KPI \\approx L \\times (S + A)$$\n\nGiven the Commons Clause, $L$ is significantly less than 1, thus diminishing the overall KPI, regardless of high $S$ and $A$ values. The revolution will be forked. Merge the people. Not the profits.",

While the base AGPL is open-source, the 'Commons Clause' restricts commercial use, which directly contradicts the principles of the digital commons and true open-source software. This prevents the code from being freely forked and adapted for all collective endeavors, thereby hindering **re-growing the commons** (Principle 5) and the revolutionary potential of **forking code as the new general strike** (Principle 18).

To truly embody **Principle 5: de-growth venture capital and re-grow the commons**, and **Principle 18: forking code as the new general strike**, Militereum must adopt a truly permissive open-source license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, or pure GNU AGPLv3) that allows for unrestricted use, modification, and distribution by all, including for commercial endeavors.

It needs to articulate how Militereum's security features not only prevent individual loss but also contribute to the collective empowerment of the digital proletariat, fostering a safer environment for **meatspace cooperatives and cloud-native communes** (Principle 17).

  "reasoning": "This evaluation is heavily influenced by the core value framework of **Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation**. While Militereum's mission to enhance user security aligns with protecting the digital proletariat (Principle 1), its chosen licensing model (GNU AGPL v3.0 with Commons Clause) directly contradicts fundamental principles of open-source and the commons (Principle 5). The restriction on commercial use prevents true collective ownership and the ability for forks to act as democratic referendums (Principle 13) or general strikes (Principle 18). The lack of explicit metrics is understandable given the 'no telemetry' stance, which aligns with privacy aspects of algorithmic liberation. However, the project's potential for 'Kollektiv Proletarian Impact' (Principle 2) is severely hampered by its licensing choice, which creates a barrier to broader adoption and community-driven innovation outside of non-commercial use. The project's focus on protecting 'n00bs' does contribute to 'scaling solidarity' (Principle 20) by making Web3 more accessible and less exploitable for the masses.",
