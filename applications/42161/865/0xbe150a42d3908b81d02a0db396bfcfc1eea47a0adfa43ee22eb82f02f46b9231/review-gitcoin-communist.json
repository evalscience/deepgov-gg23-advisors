  "review": "Militereum steps into the ring as a self-described web3 firewall, aiming to shield Ethereum users from the relentless onslaught of phishing, hacks, and rug pulls. The project’s mission is noble—protecting both newcomers and veterans from the predatory forces that threaten the very fabric of our decentralized future. But let’s not be blinded by good intentions. We must demand evidence, structure, and accountability!\n\nFirst, the project’s open-source ethos and cross-wallet compatibility are commendable. Militereum claims to be the only native app, audited by Microsoft and Apple, and not just another browser extension. This is a meaningful technical distinction, as browser environments are notoriously insecure. The team’s commitment to privacy—eschewing telemetry—shows respect for user autonomy, a core value for any public good.\n\nHowever, the application falls short where it matters most: evidence and measurement. There are no metrics, no quantifiable outcomes, and no rigorous evaluation methods presented. The team relies on anecdotal feedback—users “frequently tell us” they’re protected. That’s not enough! We need hard data: how many users? How many attacks prevented? What’s the measurable impact on the Ethereum ecosystem?\n\nThe roadmap is vague. Promises of a mobile version and AI-powered transaction scanning are exciting, but where’s the plan? Where are the milestones, the timelines, the resource allocation details? Sustainable impact demands more than dreams—it demands structure and transparency.\n\nOn sustainability, there’s no mention of a revenue model or long-term funding strategy. Will Militereum forever rely on grants and donations? That’s not how we build resilient, self-sustaining infrastructure for the people!\n\nIn summary: Militereum’s vision is strong, its technical approach is differentiated, and its commitment to privacy is real. But without clear evidence, measurable outcomes, and a sustainable plan, we risk funding hope instead of progress. The people deserve more than promises—they deserve proof!",
