  "review": "Militereum claims to be a web3 firewall for crypto wallets, aiming to protect users from phishing, hacks, and rug pulls. The project positions itself as a native desktop security app, distinguishing itself from browser-based extensions, and touts audits by Microsoft and Apple. The team has participated in multiple previous Gitcoin rounds, showing ongoing engagement with the ecosystem.\n\nLet’s get to the heart of the matter: does Militereum deliver measurable, evidence-backed impact for the Ethereum commons? The application admits it collects no usage metrics, citing privacy, and instead relies on anecdotal user feedback. This is a glaring gap. In a world where hacks and scams are rampant, we need hard data, not just good intentions. Where are the numbers? How many users have been protected? How many attacks have been blocked? How much value has been saved? Without this, we’re left in the dark.\n\nOn the technical side, Militereum’s approach—being a native app, not a browser extension—addresses real security concerns. Browser environments are indeed hostile, and a native app can offer stronger isolation. The project claims interoperability with all wallets, which, if true, is a significant achievement. However, these claims are not substantiated with technical documentation, independent audits, or user adoption statistics. The open-source repo is provided, but the application does not reference code quality, test coverage, or community contributions.\n\nThe roadmap is ambitious: mobile apps, AI transaction scanning, and more. But ambition without a clear, structured plan and measurable milestones is just talk. The application does not break down how grant funds will be allocated, nor does it provide a sustainable revenue model. There is no mention of governance, community ownership, or how the project will ensure equitable access and benefit.\n\nIn summary, Militereum addresses a real need—security for the masses. But the application falls short on evidence, transparency, and sustainability. The Ethereum commons deserves more than promises; it deserves proof, structure, and a plan for the long haul. Show us the numbers. Show us the impact. Only then can we build a safer, fairer web3 for all.",
