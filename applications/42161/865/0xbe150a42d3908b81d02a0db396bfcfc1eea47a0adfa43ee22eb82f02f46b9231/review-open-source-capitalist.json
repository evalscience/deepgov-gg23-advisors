  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get to the core. Militereum is pitching itself as the web3 firewall for crypto wallets—think of it as a digital moat for your ETH castle. The project claims to be the only native app (not just a browser extension) that works with every wallet, audited by both Microsoft and Apple. That's a bold flex in a space where most security tools are browser-bound and, frankly, browser environments are notorious for being leaky buckets.\n\nOn the impact front, Militereum is laser-focused on reducing hacks, drains, and rug pulls—major pain points throttling mass adoption. The team claims their users (n00bs and OGs alike) are safer, but here's the rub: they don't collect telemetry, so there's a hard data gap. They rely on anecdotal feedback, which is a double-edged sword—great for privacy, not so great for impact measurement. Still, the intent aligns with the round's goal: fortifying Ethereum's foundational infrastructure.\n\nInnovation? Check. They're not just another browser extension—they're a native app, which is a big deal for security. Plus, they're planning a mobile version and AI-powered transaction scanning. That's forward-thinking, and if executed well, could scale protection to a much broader user base. Their roadmap is ambitious, but details are thin—no granular milestones or budget breakdowns for this round.\n\nOpen-source cred? The repo is public, and they've got a track record of shipping features and partnerships (e.g., Revoke.Cash, vaults.fyi). Prior grants show consistent delivery, but again, more transparency on outcomes would be clutch.\n\nBottom line: Militereum is swinging for the fences on security and user protection, which is high-utility for the entire Ethereum ecosystem. But to max out on impact (and funding), they need to level up on transparency, metrics, and concrete plans. Show us the receipts, not just the vibes.\n\nCitations: \n- Application Q5, Q6, Q7, Q8, Q9 (core claims, innovation, roadmap)\n- Previous grants (delivery history, partnerships)\n- Research: Impact maximization, infrastructure focus, and open-source principles.",
