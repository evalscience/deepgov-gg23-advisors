  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. Militereum is pitching itself as the web3 firewall for crypto wallets—a native app, not a browser extension, aiming to keep both n00bs and OGs from getting phished, hacked, or rugged. The project claims to be the only wallet security extension that works with every wallet, browser-based or native, and touts audits by Microsoft and Apple App Store reviewers. That's a bold claim, and if true, it's a serious differentiator in a space littered with browser-based, often janky, security add-ons.\n\nFrom a maximization and systemic impact lens, Militereum is swinging for the fences: wallet security is a root-cause problem for mass adoption. If users keep getting drained, the whole ecosystem's growth is throttled. A native, cross-wallet firewall could be a game-changer for onboarding the next wave of users. The roadmap teases a mobile version and AI-powered transaction scanning—both high-impact, scalable plays if executed well.\n\nBut here's the rub: the app doesn't collect telemetry, so there's a hard data gap. The team claims user testimonials as proof of impact, but that's anecdotal. For a grant round focused on foundational infrastructure, we need harder evidence of reach and effectiveness. The open-source repo is public, and the team has a track record of shipping features and integrating with other DeFi tools (see previous milestones), but the lack of usage metrics is a glaring omission.\n\nOn the innovation front, Militereum is pushing boundaries with its native app approach and partnerships (e.g., Revoke.Cash, vaults.fyi). The project is open source, aligns with ethical standards, and is clearly committed to the Ethereum ecosystem. However, the application is light on specifics about current adoption, user base, and measurable outcomes. The roadmap is ambitious but needs more granularity and clear KPIs for grant accountability.\n\nBottom line: Militereum is high-potential, high-risk. If they can deliver on their vision, the impact is massive. But the lack of hard data and specifics is a drag on the score. Let's see them tighten up their metrics and roadmap, and this could be a flagship infra project for Ethereum security.",
