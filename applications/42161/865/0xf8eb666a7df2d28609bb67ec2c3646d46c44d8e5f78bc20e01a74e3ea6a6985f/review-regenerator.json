  "summary": "GovGraph is a project aimed at enhancing governance transparency, security, and coordination within the Ethereum ecosystem by visualizing relationships among governance participants. It focuses on mapping connections and interactions between power users, such as Delegates, Developers, and Citizens, to identify alliances, conflicts of interest, and clusters of influence. The project plans to use grant funds to scale to other ecosystems and further develop Sybil detection technology.",
  "review": "The GovGraph project presents a compelling case for enhancing governance transparency and security within the Ethereum ecosystem. By focusing on visualizing relationships and interactions among key governance participants, it addresses significant challenges in decision-making and influence mapping. The project's innovative approach to Sybil detection and its potential to scale across ecosystems align well with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure. However, the application lacks detailed metrics and examples of its current impact, which are crucial for assessing its contribution to the Ethereum network. Additionally, while the project outlines its goals, a more detailed roadmap with specific milestones would strengthen its case for funding.",
