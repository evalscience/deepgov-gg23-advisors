  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. GovGraph is gunning for the heart of Ethereum governance—visualizing the power plays, mapping influence, and sniffing out Sybil attacks. That’s a big deal for scaling trust and transparency, which are the backbone of any decentralized system worth its salt. The project’s focus on the OP Citizen House is a solid wedge, and the intent to scale cross-ecosystem is exactly the kind of high-leverage, high-impact move we want to see. \n\nThe team’s got receipts: previous rounds, working MVPs, and a history of iterating in public. Their Sybil detection work is bleeding-edge, and the open-source ethos is strong. But, let’s not sugarcoat it—there are some gaps. The application is light on hard metrics (where’s the user growth, adoption stats, or concrete impact numbers?). The roadmap is more of a sketch than a blueprint—no granular milestones, timelines, or KPIs. And while the vision is big, the execution plan for scaling and sustainability is fuzzy. \n\nBottom line: GovGraph is swinging for systemic change, not just patching up symptoms. That’s max utility, max scale. But to unlock serious capital, we need more than vibes—we need data, a clear path to scale, and a sharper focus on measurable outcomes. Bring the receipts, tighten the plan, and this could be a governance game-changer.",
