  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get to the core of GovGraph. This project is all about turbocharging governance transparency in the Ethereum ecosystem. Instead of the same old scoring systems, GovGraph maps out the social graph—who's connected to whom, where the influence clusters are, and who might be colluding. It's like shining a blacklight on DAO politics. The focus on OP Citizen House is a solid MVP, but the real alpha is in scaling this to other ecosystems.\n\nOn the innovation front, GovGraph is pushing boundaries with Sybil detection tech—critical for airdrops and governance integrity. The team has already shipped a case study on Farcaster Sybil detection, showing they're not just vaporware. The roadmap is clear: scale to more chains, double down on Sybil detection, and keep iterating based on user feedback. The open-source ethos is strong, and the team has a track record of building in public and collaborating with other infra projects.\n\nBut let's not sugarcoat it: the application is light on hard metrics. Where are the user numbers, adoption stats, or concrete impact data? The claim of \"improving governance\" is solid in theory, but we need more proof of real-world impact at scale. The roadmap is a bit hand-wavy—\"scaling to other ecosystems\" is great, but which ones, and by when? Also, the application could use more detail on how funds will be allocated—right now, it's just \"build more Sybil tech and scale.\"\n\nBottom line: GovGraph is a high-potential, high-leverage play for Ethereum governance infra. It's got the right ingredients for max utility and systemic impact, but needs to tighten up on specifics, metrics, and execution clarity. Let's see some hard numbers and a more granular plan, and this could be a flagship for decentralized governance analytics.",
