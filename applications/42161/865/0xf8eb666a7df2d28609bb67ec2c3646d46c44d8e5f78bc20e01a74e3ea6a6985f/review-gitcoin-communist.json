  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! GovGraph claims to be a tool for governance transparency, mapping the tangled web of relationships in Ethereum’s power structures. The project’s ambition is clear: shine a light on the hidden alliances, expose conflicts of interest, and root out Sybil attacks. That’s a noble cause—one that serves the many, not the few!\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by rhetoric. Where is the hard evidence? Where are the metrics that prove GovGraph’s impact? The application touts case studies and blog posts, but offers no quantifiable outcomes—no user adoption numbers, no measurable reduction in Sybil attacks, no clear before-and-after data. We need more than promises; we need proof!\n\nThe roadmap is vague. Scaling to other ecosystems and improving Sybil detection are worthy goals, but where is the structured plan? Where are the milestones, the KPIs, the sustainability model that ensures this tool won’t wither on the vine once the grant money dries up? The project’s open-source nature is a plus, but sustainability is not addressed beyond vague mentions of analytical services.\n\nOn governance and equity, GovGraph’s mission aligns with our values: collective benefit, transparency, and public good. But alignment is not enough. We demand rigorous evaluation, transparent reporting, and a clear plan for equitable impact across the Ethereum ecosystem—not just the OP Citizen House.\n\nIn summary: GovGraph is a promising experiment, but it must move from vision to verifiable results. Show us the data! Show us the plan! Only then can we justify allocating precious community resources. The people deserve nothing less!",
