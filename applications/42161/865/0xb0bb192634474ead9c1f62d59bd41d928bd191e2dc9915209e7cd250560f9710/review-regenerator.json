  "summary": "The OnChainSupply project aims to enhance the Ethereum ecosystem by providing modular infrastructure for smart assets, encrypted storage, smart accounts, and prebuilt dApps. It focuses on improving on-chain composability, agentic interoperability, and user simplicity. The project addresses key challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as repetitive development, limited on-chain capabilities for AI agents, and off-chain asset storage vulnerabilities. The roadmap outlines significant milestones for 2025, including the release of an open-source Smart Asset SDK and the launch of encrypted storage modules. The grant funds will be allocated to development, security audits, documentation, and operational costs.",
  "review": "The OnChainSupply project presents a compelling case for enhancing the Ethereum network's infrastructure by focusing on modular and composable on-chain solutions. The project addresses significant challenges such as repetitive development and the need for on-chain AI agent capabilities. By providing prebuilt dApps and smart modules, it aims to reduce development time and enhance interoperability. The project's focus on privacy, interoperability, and user experience aligns well with the round's eligibility criteria. However, the application lacks specific metrics or examples to demonstrate its current impact on the Ethereum network. Additionally, while the roadmap is detailed, it would benefit from more immediate milestones to track progress before 2025. The project aligns with the constitutional principles by promoting innovation, community participation, and decentralization, but it could further emphasize environmental sustainability in its approach.",
