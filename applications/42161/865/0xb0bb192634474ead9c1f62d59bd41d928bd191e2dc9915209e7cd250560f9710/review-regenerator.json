  "summary": "The OnChainSupply project aims to enhance the Ethereum ecosystem by providing modular infrastructure for smart assets, encrypted storage, smart accounts, and prebuilt dApps. It focuses on improving on-chain composability, agentic interoperability, and user simplicity. The project addresses key challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as repetitive development, limited AI agent capabilities, and off-chain asset storage issues. The roadmap outlines significant milestones, including the release of an open-source Smart Asset SDK and the launch of encrypted storage modules. The project aligns with the round's goals by contributing to Ethereum's infrastructure, engaging in pioneering development, and adhering to open-source principles.",
  "review": "The OnChainSupply project presents a compelling case for enhancing the Ethereum ecosystem's infrastructure. It offers a modular approach to smart assets, encrypted storage, and smart accounts, which are crucial for reducing development redundancy and improving user accessibility. The project's focus on on-chain composability and agentic interoperability is innovative, addressing the limitations of current off-chain systems. The roadmap is well-structured, with clear milestones that align with the project's objectives and the round's focus on infrastructure development. However, the application lacks specific metrics to quantify its impact and does not provide detailed information on community engagement or environmental sustainability considerations. Overall, the project demonstrates potential for significant contributions to the Ethereum network, but further details on impact measurement and community involvement are needed.",
