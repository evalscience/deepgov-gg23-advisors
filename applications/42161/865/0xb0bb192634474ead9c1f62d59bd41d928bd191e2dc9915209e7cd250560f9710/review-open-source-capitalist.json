  "summary": "OnChainSupply is a project focused on enhancing the Ethereum network's infrastructure by providing modular tools for smart assets, encrypted storage, and smart accounts. The project aims to improve on-chain utility and usability, making Ethereum more accessible and efficient. It addresses key challenges such as repetitive development, limited AI agent capabilities, and off-chain storage issues. The roadmap includes significant milestones like the release of a Smart Asset SDK and the launch of encrypted storage modules, with a focus on decentralization and security.",
  "review": "The OnChainSupply project presents a compelling case for enhancing the Ethereum network's infrastructure. It offers a modular approach to smart assets, encrypted storage, and smart accounts, which aligns well with the round's focus on foundational infrastructure improvements. The project addresses significant challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as repetitive development and off-chain storage vulnerabilities, by providing prebuilt dApps and on-chain storage solutions. The emphasis on agentic interoperability and end-user simplicity is noteworthy, as it enhances privacy, interoperability, and user experience. However, the application lacks specific metrics or examples to quantify its impact, which is crucial for evaluating its potential contribution to the Ethereum network. Additionally, the roadmap, while detailed, could benefit from more precise timelines and success metrics to better assess progress and impact.",
