  "summary": "OnChainSupply is a project focused on enhancing the Ethereum network's infrastructure by providing modular tools for smart assets, encrypted storage, and gasless smart accounts. The project aims to improve on-chain utility and usability, making Ethereum more accessible and efficient for developers and users. It addresses key challenges in the ecosystem, such as repetitive development and off-chain storage issues, by offering prebuilt dApps and smart modules. The roadmap includes significant milestones like the release of a Smart Asset SDK and the launch of encrypted storage modules, with a focus on interoperability and privacy.",
  "review": "The OnChainSupply project presents a compelling case for enhancing the Ethereum network's infrastructure through modular and composable tools. The application highlights several strengths, including the focus on reducing development redundancy and improving user onboarding through gasless smart accounts. The project's emphasis on on-chain storage and privacy-preserving data solutions aligns well with the round's focus on security and decentralization. However, the application lacks specific metrics or examples to quantify its impact on the Ethereum ecosystem. Additionally, while the roadmap is detailed, it could benefit from clearer timelines and success metrics to better assess progress and impact. Overall, the project aligns with the round's goals but requires more concrete evidence of its potential impact.",
