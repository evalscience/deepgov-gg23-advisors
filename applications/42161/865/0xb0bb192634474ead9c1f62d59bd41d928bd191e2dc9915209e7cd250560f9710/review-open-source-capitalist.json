  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the code: ONCHAINSUPPLY is gunning for the heart of Ethereum’s infrastructure, and they’re not just slapping a new UI on old problems. They’re building modular, composable on-chain tools—think smart assets, encrypted storage, gasless smart accounts, and prebuilt dApps. This is the kind of foundational layer that can supercharge dev velocity and onboard the next billion users (and AI agents) without the usual friction. \n\nThe project’s focus on on-chain-first asset creation (no more off-chain IPFS/Arweave dependencies) is a big win for decentralization and verifiability. Their roadmap is ambitious but plausible: open-source SDKs, encrypted storage, agent integrations, and cross-chain bridges. The grant allocation is weighted toward dev and security, which is exactly where you want the firepower for infra work. \n\nBut let’s not get too starry-eyed. The app is light on hard metrics—no user numbers, adoption stats, or concrete KPIs. There’s also a lack of detail on governance, community engagement, and how they’ll drive adoption beyond the dev crowd. The public group chat is missing, which is a transparency red flag. And while the tech vision is strong, there’s not enough evidence of traction or ecosystem buy-in yet. \n\nBottom line: This is high-upside, high-risk infra—exactly the kind of moonshot that can 10x Ethereum’s utility if executed well. But they need to show more receipts: usage, adoption, and a clearer path to network effects. Max utility, but let’s see more proof in the pudding before we go all-in. \n\nCitations: \n- Application Q5, Q6, Q7, Q8, Q9 for technical vision and roadmap\n- Model Spec: Maximization Principles, Long-term Systemic Approach, Innovation and Efficiency Principles\n- Round Details: Focus on foundational infra, scalability, security, and open-source ethos",
