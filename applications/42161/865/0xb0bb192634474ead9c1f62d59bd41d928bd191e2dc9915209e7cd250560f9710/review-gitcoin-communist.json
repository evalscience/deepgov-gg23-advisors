  "summary": "OnChainSupply is a project focused on enhancing the Ethereum network's infrastructure by providing modular tools for smart assets, encrypted storage, and smart accounts. The project aims to reduce development redundancy and improve user onboarding by abstracting technical complexities. It emphasizes on-chain composability, agentic interoperability, and user simplicity, with a roadmap extending to 2025. The project aligns with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's foundational infrastructure, particularly in privacy, interoperability, and user experience.",
  "review": "The OnChainSupply project presents a compelling case for enhancing the Ethereum network's infrastructure through modular and composable tools. The application highlights significant contributions to the Ethereum ecosystem by addressing key challenges such as repetitive development, limited on-chain capabilities for AI agents, and off-chain asset storage vulnerabilities. The project's focus on on-chain composability and agentic interoperability is innovative, offering solutions like gasless smart accounts and encrypted storage modules. However, the application lacks specific metrics or evidence of past success, which is crucial for evaluating its potential impact. The roadmap is ambitious, with clear milestones, but the absence of detailed sustainability plans raises concerns about long-term viability. The project aligns with the round's goals, but more emphasis on measurable outcomes and sustainability is needed to fully meet the model specification's principles.",
