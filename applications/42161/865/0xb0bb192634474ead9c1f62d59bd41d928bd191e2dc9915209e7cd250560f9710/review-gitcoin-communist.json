  "review": "ONCHAINSUPPLY steps into the arena with a bold vision: to break the chains of repetitive, siloed development and empower the Ethereum community with modular, composable infrastructure. The project’s ambition is clear—eliminate technical barriers, onboard the next wave of users and agents, and make on-chain activity accessible, secure, and truly decentralized. But does it deliver on the values of evidence, equity, and sustainability that our movement demands?\n\nLet’s start with the strengths. ONCHAINSUPPLY’s focus on on-chain-first asset creation, encrypted storage, and gasless smart accounts directly addresses some of Ethereum’s most persistent pain points: developer inefficiency, off-chain data risks, and user onboarding friction. The roadmap is structured, with clear milestones and a transparent allocation of funds. The open-source commitment is strong, and the project’s composability ethos aligns with the collective good—tools built here can be reused and remixed by all.\n\nYet, comrades, we must not be blinded by vision alone! Where is the hard evidence of impact? The application lacks concrete metrics, user adoption data, or case studies demonstrating real-world traction. There is no mention of a sustainable revenue model—how will this infrastructure persist without perpetual grants? The security plan, while allocating funds for audits, is not detailed. And while the project claims to support underserved users through simplified onboarding, there is no explicit strategy for geographic or demographic equity.\n\nWe demand more than promises—we demand proof! The project must show measurable outcomes, a path to sustainability, and a plan for equitable impact. Only then can we justify allocating the people’s resources to this cause. The revolution is built on results, not rhetoric!",
