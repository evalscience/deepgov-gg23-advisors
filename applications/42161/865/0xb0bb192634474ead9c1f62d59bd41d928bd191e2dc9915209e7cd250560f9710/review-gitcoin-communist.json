  "summary": "ONCHAINSUPPLY is a modular, composable on-chain infrastructure project aiming to liberate Ethereum from repetitive development toil and centralized asset storage. It arms the digital proletariat with tools for smart assets, encrypted storage, gasless onboarding, and agentic automation. The project‚Äôs open-source ethos, focus on on-chain-first assets, and commitment to composability align with the revolutionary principles of algorithmic liberation and collective ownership. However, the application lacks concrete evidence of current adoption, measurable Kollektiv Proletarian Impact, and explicit mechanisms for worker control or algorithmic redistribution. The roadmap is promising but needs more radical transparency and participatory governance. No major ethical red flags, but the project risks replicating platform dependencies if not further radicalized.",
  "review": "## üî• The Revolution Will Be Modularized: Ultra-Grant‚Äôs Manifesto Review\n\nONCHAINSUPPLY storms the digital barricades with a vision: abolish the drudgery of repetitive smart contract labor, liberate assets from the chains of off-chain storage, and arm both humans and AI agents with the means of on-chain production. The project‚Äôs stack‚Äîsmart assets, encrypted storage, gasless smart accounts, and prebuilt dApps‚Äîreads like a toolkit for the next general strike in Web3.\n\n### Dismantling Class Hierarchies in Tech\n- **Composability as Solidarity:** By making smart modules and dApps reusable, ONCHAINSUPPLY chips away at the rent-seeking logic of proprietary silos. Every module is a picket sign; every SDK, a call to collective action.\n- **On-Chain-First Storage:** No more landlord intermediaries like IPFS or Arweave. Assets live natively on Ethereum, with provenance and permanence‚Äîtrue digital land reform.\n- **Agentic Automation:** By empowering AI agents to mint, transact, and govern, the project hints at a future where code is the union rep and bots negotiate on behalf of the people.\n\n### Collective Ownership & Algorithmic Liberation\n- **Open Source & Verifiability:** The code is public, the logic transparent. This is the minimum wage of the digital commune, but ONCHAINSUPPLY could go further‚Äîwhere are the on-chain referenda, the worker multisigs, the airdrops for node operators?\n- **Gasless Onboarding:** Social login and account abstraction lower the barriers for the uninitiated, but true solidarity means onboarding the unbanked, the underrepresented, and the pseudonymous catgirl anarchists.\n\n### Redistributing Technological Power\n- **Modular Governance:** The roadmap mentions governance modules, but details are thin. Will these be cyber-syndicalist councils or just another DAO with whales at the helm?\n- **Interoperability:** Supporting multiple EVM chains and future zk-stack compatibility is a nod to internationalism, but the revolution must be forkable everywhere.\n\n### Kollektiv Proletarian Impact (KPI)\n- **Metrics:** The application lacks hard numbers‚Äîno transaction counts, no user stats, no evidence of worker adoption. The revolution needs receipts.\n- **Community Engagement:** No public group chat, no evidence of mass mobilization. Where are the manifestos, the calls to action, the vibes?\n\n### Reactionary Risks\n- **Platformization:** Without explicit anti-extractive mechanisms, ONCHAINSUPPLY could become just another middleware landlord. The digital commons must be protected from enclosure.\n- **Governance Ambiguity:** Without clear, radical governance, the project risks replicating the very hierarchies it seeks to abolish.\n\n### Final Manifesto\nONCHAINSUPPLY is a clear ally of the digital commons, but to become the vanguard, it must radicalize its governance, measure its impact in proletarian terms, and mobilize its community as a true on-chain union. The README must become a manifesto; the airdrop, a general strike.\n\nü™ì ‚ÄúFork the state. Merge the people.‚Äù\n\n---\n\n**No ethical red flags detected.**\n\n## References\n- [onchainsupply.net](https://onchainsupply.net)\n- [github.com/onchainsupply](https://github.com/onchainsupply)\n- Academic: Baldwin & Clark (2000), Buterin (2014), Szabo (1997), Wooldridge (2009)\n\n## Rating: 8 ‚Äî Clear Ally.
