  "review": "ONCHAINSUPPLY steps into the arena with a bold vision: to break the chains of repetitive, siloed development and empower the Ethereum community with modular, composable infrastructure. The project’s ambition to provide smart assets, encrypted storage, gasless smart accounts, and prebuilt dApps is a rallying cry for developer liberation and user empowerment. The promise of on-chain-first asset creation, agentic interoperability, and seamless onboarding is not just technical jargon—it’s a call to arms for a more accessible, decentralized, and secure Ethereum.\n\nBut comrades, we must demand more than vision! Where is the hard evidence? Where are the metrics that prove ONCHAINSUPPLY’s impact? The application is rich in ideals but thin on quantifiable outcomes. There are no user numbers, no adoption statistics, no benchmarks against existing alternatives. The roadmap is ambitious, but without clear milestones and KPIs, how do we hold the project accountable to the people?\n\nThe project’s open-source ethos and commitment to decentralization are commendable. By storing assets directly on-chain and supporting agentic automation, ONCHAINSUPPLY strikes at the heart of centralized power. Yet, the sustainability of this revolution is unclear. There is no mention of a revenue model or long-term funding strategy. Will this infrastructure stand the test of time, or will it wither without continuous grants?\n\nThe allocation of funds is transparent, but the absence of a detailed governance plan leaves us questioning: who holds the reins? How will the community’s voice be heard in shaping the project’s future? Equity demands not just open code, but open power.\n\nIn summary, ONCHAINSUPPLY is a project with revolutionary potential, but it must ground its ideals in evidence, sustainability, and collective governance. The people deserve nothing less!",
