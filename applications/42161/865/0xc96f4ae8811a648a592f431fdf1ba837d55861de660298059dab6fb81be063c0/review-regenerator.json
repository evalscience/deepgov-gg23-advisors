  "summary": "The grant application for dWeb.host proposes a free IPFS pinning service for all ENS domains, aiming to ensure the permanence of websites hosted on ENS. The project addresses the issue of websites being lost due to reliance on commercial pinning services that require subscriptions. By offering a free service, it contributes to the decentralization and security of the Ethereum network. The project has already pinned over 12,000 websites, contributing more than 65 GB of storage. However, the application lacks detailed information on the project's roadmap, funding allocation, and community engagement strategies.",
  "review": "The dWeb.host project presents a compelling case for enhancing the Ethereum network's infrastructure by providing a free IPFS pinning service for ENS domains. This initiative addresses a significant problem in the ecosystem: the loss of websites due to the discontinuation of commercial pinning services. By ensuring the permanence of these websites, the project contributes to the decentralization and security of the Ethereum network, aligning with the round's focus on strengthening foundational infrastructure. The project's impact is evidenced by the pinning of over 12,000 websites, totaling more than 65 GB of storage. However, the application could be strengthened by providing a more detailed roadmap, including specific milestones and timelines, as well as a clear plan for the allocation of grant funds. Additionally, the application would benefit from outlining strategies for community engagement and collaboration, which are crucial for fostering innovation and transformation in line with the model specification's principles.",
