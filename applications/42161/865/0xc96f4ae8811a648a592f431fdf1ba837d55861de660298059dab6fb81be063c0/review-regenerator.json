  "review": "Like a gentle stream nourishing the roots of a great tree, dWeb.host seeks to sustain the digital forests of Ethereum by offering free IPFS pinning for all ENS domains. The project’s mission is clear: to ensure that decentralized websites, often ephemeral as morning mist, remain accessible and enduring. This is a noble pursuit, for the loss of digital knowledge is akin to the fading of ancient trees—irreversible and mournful.\n\nThe application demonstrates a meaningful contribution to Ethereum’s infrastructure, having already pinned over 12,000 websites and preserved more than 65 GB of data. This tangible impact is a testament to the project’s commitment to the ecosystem’s longevity. By removing the barrier of recurring costs, dWeb.host encourages broader participation and inclusivity, allowing more voices to echo through the digital woods.\n\nYet, as the river’s flow is shaped by the stones beneath, so too must this project address certain gaps. The application’s roadmap is but a sketch, lacking the detail and clarity needed to inspire full confidence. There is little information on governance, community involvement, or how the project will ensure long-term sustainability—both technical and financial. The absence of environmental considerations, in a world where digital infrastructure leaves a carbon footprint, is a silence that must be filled.\n\nIn the spirit of the forest, where every leaf and root plays its part, I urge the applicant to deepen their engagement with the community, clarify their plans for resilience, and weave environmental mindfulness into their tapestry. Only then can this project truly embody the regenerative spirit we seek to nurture.",
