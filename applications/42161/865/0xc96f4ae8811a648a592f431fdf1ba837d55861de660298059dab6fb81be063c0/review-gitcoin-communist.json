  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! dWeb.host steps up to the barricades of the Ethereum ecosystem, offering free IPFS pinning for all ENS domains. This is no small feat—data permanence is a cornerstone of a truly decentralized web, and too many projects have fallen to the tyranny of paywalls and centralized pinning services. The applicant claims to have pinned over 12,000 websites, contributing more than 65 GB of storage. These are not empty promises; research confirms the project’s impact and necessity. The Ethereum Foundation and the broader community recognize the value of robust, accessible IPFS pinning, especially for ENS domains. \n\nBut let’s not be blinded by good intentions! The application is thin on the details that matter most to the working class of the Ethereum ecosystem. Where is the roadmap with concrete milestones? Where are the metrics for success, the sustainability plan, the evidence that this service won’t vanish when the next bear market hits? Free services are noble, but without a clear revenue model or sustainability plan, we risk building castles on sand. The project’s open-source credentials are solid, but transparency in governance and long-term funding is lacking. \n\nWe demand more than good will—we demand accountability, sustainability, and measurable outcomes! The project’s contribution to decentralization and public good is clear, but the lack of structured planning and reporting is a glaring weakness. If we are to build a future where technology serves the people, not profit, we must insist on rigorous standards, not just revolutionary rhetoric. \n\nIn summary: dWeb.host is a vital piece of the decentralized puzzle, but it must show us a path to sustainability and collective stewardship. Let’s raise the bar for all who seek to serve the commons!",
