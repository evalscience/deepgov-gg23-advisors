  "summary": "The grant application for dWeb.host presents a project focused on providing free IPFS pinning for all ENS domains, addressing the issue of website loss on IPFS due to commercial pinning service limitations. The project claims to have pinned over 12,000 websites, contributing more than 65 GB of storage, and aims to enhance the stability and adoption of decentralized websites hosted on ENS through IPFS and IPNS.",
  "review": "The dWeb.host project offers a valuable service to the Ethereum ecosystem by addressing a significant problem: the loss of websites hosted on IPFS due to reliance on commercial pinning services. By providing free IPFS pinning for ENS domains, the project contributes to the decentralization and security of the Ethereum network. The application highlights the project's impact, with over 12,000 websites pinned and more than 65 GB of storage contributed. This aligns with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure and supporting projects that enhance privacy, interoperability, and user experience. However, the application lacks detailed information on the project's sustainability model and governance structure, which are crucial for long-term success and alignment with the model specification's principles.",
