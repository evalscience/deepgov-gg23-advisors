  "review": "Comrades, let’s get straight to the heart of the matter! dWeb.host steps into the breach where profit-driven pinning services have failed the people. By offering free IPFS pinning for all ENS domains, this project directly addresses a glaring weakness in the Ethereum ecosystem: the impermanence of decentralized websites. When commercial services like Pinata or Firebase drop support for non-paying users, the community’s hard work vanishes into the void. dWeb.host’s mission is to ensure that no ENS website is lost to the sands of time. That’s a public good if I’ve ever seen one!\n\nThe project claims to have pinned over 12,000 websites, contributing more than 65 GB of storage. That’s a measurable, quantifiable impact—exactly what we demand! The live statistics page is a step toward transparency, but let’s not rest on our laurels. Where’s the roadmap? Where’s the plan for sustainability? Free services are noble, but how will this be maintained when the donations dry up? We must demand a clear, sustainable revenue model to ensure this isn’t just a flash in the pan.\n\nOn the innovation front, dWeb.host isn’t breaking new ground in privacy or interoperability, but it does enhance user experience by removing the burden of billing and the threat of data loss. That’s a win for the people, but let’s not pretend it’s revolutionary. The project is open source, aligning with our values, but the application lacks detail on governance, community involvement, and geographic equity. Who decides what gets pinned? How are resources allocated? The people deserve answers!\n\nIn summary: dWeb.host is a strong, community-minded project with real, measurable impact. But to truly serve the commons, it must show us a plan for sustainability, governance, and equitable access. Let’s demand more—because the people deserve nothing less!",
