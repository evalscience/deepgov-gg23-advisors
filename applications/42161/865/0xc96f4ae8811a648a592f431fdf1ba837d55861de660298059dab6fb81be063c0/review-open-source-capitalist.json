  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. dWeb.host is gunning for a core pain point in the Ethereum ecosystem: data permanence for decentralized websites. The project’s mission—free IPFS pinning for all ENS domains—directly addresses the risk of content loss due to paywalled or unreliable pinning services. That’s a big deal for the long-term viability of decentralized web infrastructure. \n\nThe numbers check out: 12,000+ websites pinned, 65GB+ of storage, and live stats to back it up. That’s not just vaporware; it’s real, measurable impact. The research confirms that IPFS pinning is a critical backbone for ENS and Ethereum dApps, and dWeb.host is filling a gap left by commercial services that can rug-pull users if they stop paying. This is a textbook case of maximizing utility for the greatest number—no paywalls, no gatekeeping, just pure infrastructure play.\n\nOn the innovation front, the project’s approach is pragmatic: make ENS a forever-home for websites, no billing headaches, no risk of content vanishing. That’s a UX win and a decentralization boost. The roadmap is a bit thin—\"make IPFS pinning more stable and expand operators\" is more of a vision than a concrete plan. I want to see milestones, scaling strategies, and sustainability models. How will this stay free and reliable as usage explodes? Where’s the plan for redundancy, operator incentives, or decentralized governance?\n\nNo smart contracts deployed, so attack surface is low, but also means less composability with other on-chain infra. Still, the impact is clear: more robust, censorship-resistant web infra for Ethereum. That’s a long-term systemic win.\n\nBottom line: dWeb.host is shipping real value, but needs to level up its roadmap and sustainability game to hit max scale. Show me how you’ll keep the lights on and the pins live when the next 100,000 sites roll in. Build in public, but plan for the moonshot.\n\nReferences: Research confirms the critical role of IPFS pinning for ENS and Ethereum dApps (see Ethereum Foundation docs, user testimonials, and academic research on decentralized storage).",
