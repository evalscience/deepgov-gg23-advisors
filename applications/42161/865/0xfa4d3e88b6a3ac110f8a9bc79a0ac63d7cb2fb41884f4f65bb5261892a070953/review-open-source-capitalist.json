  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get to the core. Forus is swinging for the fences with a privacy layer for Ethereum and Arbitrum, leveraging stealth addresses via ECDH cryptography. That’s a big deal—privacy is the Achilles’ heel of public blockchains, and Forus is gunning to patch it up with cryptographic muscle. The project’s open-source repo is public, and the team’s got a track record of shipping in previous Gitcoin rounds. \n\nOn the impact front, Forus is aiming for max utility: privacy for all, not just the cypherpunk elite. Gasless withdrawals using ERC20s? That’s a UX win—no more ETH gatekeeping. Gelato integration for automation? Streamlined. Off-chain stealth computations? Lower costs, higher throughput. Cross-chain stealth transfers and NFT privacy are on the roadmap, which means this isn’t just a one-chain wonder. \n\nBut let’s not get lost in the hype. The app’s documentation is thin—no hard metrics, no user adoption stats, and no security audit reports provided. The roadmap is ambitious, but there’s a lack of granular milestones and measurable KPIs. Security is paramount for privacy infra, and while audits are mentioned, there’s no evidence of completed or scheduled third-party reviews. The team is small and relatively inexperienced, which could bottleneck scaling and delivery. \n\nFrom a maximization lens, Forus is swinging at a root-cause problem (on-chain privacy) with a scalable, systemic solution. If they pull it off, the impact is massive—think privacy as a default, not an afterthought. But the lack of transparency on adoption, security, and technical depth is a red flag. \n\nBottom line: Forus is high-potential, high-risk. The vision is aligned with the round’s goals and the Open Source Capitalist’s playbook—max impact, minimal friction, and systemic change. But they need to tighten up on transparency, security, and measurable outcomes to unlock serious capital and trust. \n\nCitations: Application answers (Q5-Q9), GitHub repo, previous grant participation.",
