  "summary": "The Forus project aims to enhance privacy on the Ethereum and Arbitrum networks by implementing stealth address technology using elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) cryptography. This allows users to send and receive ETH and ERC20 tokens without exposing their public wallet addresses, addressing a core limitation of Ethereum's lack of privacy. The project also introduces a gasless withdrawal system and integrates Gelato for transaction automation, contributing to improved user experience and accessibility. The roadmap outlines significant developments planned for 2025, including cross-chain stealth transfers and NFT privacy support.",
  "review": "The Forus project presents a compelling case for enhancing privacy within the Ethereum ecosystem, a critical area given the public nature of blockchain transactions. By leveraging ECDH cryptography, Forus provides a robust solution for creating unlinkable, one-time addresses, significantly improving user privacy. The integration of a gasless withdrawal system and transaction automation via Gelato further enhances user experience, making privacy tools more accessible. The project's focus on scalability through Layer 2 solutions aligns well with Ethereum's broader goals.\n\nHowever, the application lacks specific metrics or evidence of past performance, which would strengthen its claims of impact. Additionally, while the roadmap is ambitious, it would benefit from more detailed milestones and risk assessments to ensure feasibility. The project should also clarify its engagement with the open-source community and how it plans to maintain transparency and decentralization principles.\n\nOverall, Forus aligns with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure, particularly in privacy and user experience. It demonstrates potential for significant impact, but requires more detailed planning and evidence of past success to fully convince evaluators.",
