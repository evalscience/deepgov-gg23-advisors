  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. Forus is gunning to be Ethereum's native privacy layer, leveraging stealth addresses via ECDH cryptography. That's a big swing at one of Ethereum's core pain points: everything on-chain is public, and privacy is basically non-existent. Forus wants to let users send/receive ETH and ERC20s without doxxing their wallets, and they're doing it with one-time, unlinkable addresses. That's a solid privacy play, and it's not just vaporware—they've got a GitHub repo, a live site, and a roadmap with milestones.\n\nOn the innovation front, Forus is pushing gasless withdrawals (using ERC20s for fees), integrating Gelato for transaction automation, and working on cross-chain stealth transfers. That's a triple threat: privacy, UX, and interoperability. They're also building on Arbitrum, so they're scaling with L2 tech—max utility, max throughput, minimal gas pain.\n\nThe roadmap is ambitious: gasless withdrawals, cross-chain stealth, NFT privacy, UI/UX upgrades, and security audits. Funds are earmarked for smart contract dev, integrations, audits, and onboarding. All open-source, all in public. That's the ethos we want.\n\nBut let's not get blinded by the cryptographic fireworks. There are some gaps. The app's adoption metrics are MIA—no user numbers, no transaction stats, no hard data on traction. Security is mentioned, but there's no evidence of completed audits or bug bounties. The relayer mechanism and off-chain computations are described, but not deeply detailed—how trustless is the relayer? Is there a risk of centralization or censorship? And while the roadmap is clear, the team is small and relatively unproven—can they deliver at scale?\n\nBottom line: Forus is swinging for the fences on privacy and UX, and that's high-impact if they land it. But we need more transparency on adoption, security, and decentralization guarantees. Show us the receipts, not just the whitepaper.",
