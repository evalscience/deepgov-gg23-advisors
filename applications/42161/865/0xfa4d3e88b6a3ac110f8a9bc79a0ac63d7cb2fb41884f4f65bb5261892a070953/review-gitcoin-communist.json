  "review": "The Forus project stands at the barricades of Ethereum’s future, demanding privacy as a right, not a privilege! In a world where every transaction is a public spectacle, Forus brings the promise of true financial autonomy to the working class of Web3. By leveraging elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) cryptography, Forus generates stealth addresses, shielding users from the prying eyes of surveillance capitalists and data harvesters. This is not just technical innovation—it’s a stand for digital dignity!\n\nThe project’s roadmap is ambitious and clear: gasless withdrawals, cross-chain stealth transfers, NFT privacy, and rigorous security audits. These are not empty promises; they are structured, time-bound goals. The integration of Gelato for transaction automation and the use of ERC20 tokens for gasless withdrawals directly address the pain points of accessibility and usability, especially for those who can’t afford to keep ETH on hand for every transaction. This is a step toward equitable access!\n\nForus is open-source, aligns with the round’s focus on foundational infrastructure, and has a history of engagement in the Ethereum and Arbitrum ecosystems. The team’s commitment to decentralization is evident in their trustless, audited smart contracts and off-chain computation model. Yet, comrades, we must demand more than vision—we demand evidence! The application lacks hard metrics: user adoption numbers, transaction volumes, or security audit results. There is no detailed sustainability plan—how will Forus survive when the grant money runs dry? Where is the community governance structure that ensures the people, not just the developers, have a say?\n\nIn summary: Forus is a bold, necessary intervention in Ethereum’s infrastructure, but it must back its rhetoric with data, sustainability, and collective governance. The revolution is not won with slogans alone!",
