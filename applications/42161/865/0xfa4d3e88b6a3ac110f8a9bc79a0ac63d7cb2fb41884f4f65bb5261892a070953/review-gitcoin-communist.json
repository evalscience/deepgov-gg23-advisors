  "summary": "The Forus project aims to enhance privacy on the Ethereum and Arbitrum networks by implementing stealth address technology using elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) cryptography. This allows users to send and receive ETH and ERC20 tokens without exposing public wallet addresses, addressing a core limitation of Ethereum's lack of privacy. The project also introduces a gasless withdrawal system and integrates Gelato for transaction automation, contributing to improved user experience and accessibility. The roadmap outlines significant developments planned for 2025, including cross-chain stealth transfers and NFT privacy support.",
  "review": "The Forus project presents a compelling case for enhancing privacy within the Ethereum ecosystem, aligning with the round's focus on strengthening foundational infrastructure. By leveraging ECDH cryptography, Forus addresses the critical issue of transaction traceability on Ethereum, offering a solution that enhances user privacy without compromising network transparency. The integration of a gasless withdrawal system and Gelato for transaction automation further improves user experience, making privacy tools more accessible.\n\nThe project's roadmap is ambitious, with plans to implement cross-chain stealth transfers and NFT privacy support by 2025. However, the application lacks detailed metrics or evidence of current impact, which is crucial for evaluating its contribution to the Ethereum network's infrastructure. Additionally, while the project outlines a clear use of grant funds, it does not provide a sustainable revenue model, raising concerns about long-term viability.\n\nOverall, Forus demonstrates potential in pioneering privacy solutions for Ethereum, but it requires more concrete evidence of impact and sustainability to fully align with the model specification's emphasis on measurable outcomes and sustainable systems.",
