  "summary": "The Forus project aims to enhance privacy on the Ethereum network by implementing stealth address technology using elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) cryptography. It addresses the lack of privacy in Ethereum transactions by enabling users to send and receive ETH and ERC20 tokens without exposing public wallet addresses. The project also introduces a gasless withdrawal system and integrates Gelato for transaction automation, contributing to Ethereum's scalability and user experience. The roadmap outlines significant milestones for 2025, including cross-chain stealth transfers and NFT privacy support.",
  "review": "The Forus project presents a compelling case for enhancing privacy within the Ethereum ecosystem, addressing a critical limitation of public traceability in blockchain transactions. By leveraging elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) cryptography, Forus provides a robust solution for creating unlinkable, one-time addresses, thus ensuring user privacy. The integration of a gasless withdrawal system and Gelato for transaction automation further enhances user experience and accessibility, aligning with the round's focus on infrastructure development and scalability. However, the application lacks detailed metrics or evidence of current impact, which is crucial for evaluating its effectiveness and sustainability. Additionally, while the roadmap is ambitious, it requires clearer timelines and resource allocation details to ensure feasibility and accountability.",
