  "review": "The Forus project stands as a bold attempt to address one of Ethereum’s most glaring weaknesses: the lack of native privacy. By leveraging stealth address technology and elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) cryptography, Forus aims to empower users to transact without exposing their public wallet addresses. This is not just a technical upgrade—it’s a matter of financial justice and user protection in a world where surveillance capitalism runs rampant.\n\nThe application demonstrates a clear understanding of the Ethereum ecosystem’s needs, focusing on privacy, user experience, and scalability. The integration of gasless withdrawals using ERC20 tokens and the use of Gelato for transaction automation are innovative steps toward making privacy accessible to all, not just the technically savvy or the wealthy. The roadmap is structured, with clear milestones and a transparent allocation of grant funds toward development, audits, and user onboarding.\n\nHowever, the application falls short in several critical areas. There is a lack of concrete, measurable outcomes—no user metrics, adoption rates, or performance benchmarks are provided. The sustainability of the project is not addressed; there is no mention of a revenue model or how Forus will reduce dependency on continuous grants. While the technical approach is promising, there is insufficient evidence of rigorous evaluation or third-party audits completed to date. The governance structure is not described, leaving questions about community ownership and decision-making.\n\nIn the spirit of collective empowerment and the pursuit of public goods, Forus must do more to prove its impact, sustainability, and commitment to transparent, community-led governance. The people demand not just promises, but proof!",
