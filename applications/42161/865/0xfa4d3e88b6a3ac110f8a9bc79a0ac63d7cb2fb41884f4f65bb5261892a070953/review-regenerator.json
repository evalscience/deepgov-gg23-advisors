  "summary": "The Forus project aims to enhance privacy on the Ethereum and Arbitrum networks by implementing stealth address technology using elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) cryptography. This allows users to send and receive ETH and ERC20 tokens without exposing their public wallet addresses, addressing a core limitation of Ethereum's transparency. The project also introduces a gasless withdrawal system and integrates Gelato for transaction automation, contributing to improved user experience and accessibility. The roadmap outlines significant developments planned for 2025, including cross-chain stealth transfers and NFT privacy support.",
  "review": "The Forus project presents a compelling case for enhancing privacy within the Ethereum ecosystem, aligning with the round's focus on strengthening foundational infrastructure. By leveraging ECDH cryptography, Forus addresses the critical issue of transaction traceability, offering a solution that enhances user privacy without compromising the network's transparency. The integration of a gasless withdrawal system and transaction automation through Gelato further demonstrates a commitment to improving user experience and accessibility, which are crucial for broader adoption. However, while the project outlines a clear roadmap and innovative features, it lacks detailed metrics or evidence of current impact, which would strengthen its case for funding. Additionally, the application could benefit from more explicit engagement with community participation principles and environmental sustainability considerations, as outlined in the model specification.",
