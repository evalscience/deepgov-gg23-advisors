By utilizing elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) cryptography, Forus generates unique stealth addresses for each transaction, allowing users to receive ETH and ERC20 tokens privately via a cryptographic link, without exposing their real wallet addresses.\n\n**How It Works:**\n1. **Elliptic Curve Cryptography & Forus Keys**: Forus uses ECDH cryptography to create a key pair (public and private). The public key forms a cryptographic link, which can be shared without revealing any association with the user’s actual blockchain address. This key generation process allows for the creation of multiple, independent Forus keys for enhanced flexibility.\n   \n2. **Stealth Address Generation**: When a sender initiates a transaction, they use the shared public key to compute a stealth address through a real-time, off-chain operation, utilizing their own ephemeral private key. This ensures that every transaction is linked to a one-time, unpredictable stealth address, shielding both sender and receiver from any blockchain-based traceability.\n\n3. **Fund Retrieval & Privacy**: Receivers monitor the Forus contract for new transactions, derive the corresponding private key using their Forus secret, and access their funds in a secure, anonymous manner. The stealth address breaks any link between sender and receiver, ensuring complete privacy in on-chain financial interactions.\n\n**Built on Ethereum's Infrastructure**: Forus enhances the privacy layer on Ethereum and Arbitrum, which inherently prioritize transparency.
