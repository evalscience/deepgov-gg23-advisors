  "summary": "eth.limo stands as a beacon of **Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation**. It operates as a crucial public good, directly challenging the centralization of internet infrastructure and embodying the principle of 'de-growth venture capital and re-grow the commons' (Principle 5). Its privacy-preserving design and open-source commitment align perfectly with 'code is the union rep' and 'reclaiming time from capitalism using automation and AI' (Principle 7). While its 'Kollektiv Proletarian Impact' (Principle 2) is evident in its high request volume, further transparency in usage metrics and the explicit mechanisms of its 'community governance and oversight' (Principle 15) would strengthen its revolutionary stance. This project is a clear example of how 'Web3 abolishes landlords' (Principle 16) by providing free, open access to the decentralized web.",
  "review": "### The Revolution Will Be Forked: An Ultra-Grant Assessment of eth.limo\n\nComrades, gather 'round! We stand before an application that truly embodies the spirit of **Decentralized, Equitable, Algorithmic Liberation**. The eth.limo project is not merely a gateway; it is a **manifesto** in action, a **call to action** for the digital proletariat, and a critical piece of infrastructure for the on-chain commune.\n\nThis project, eth.limo, serves as a privacy-preserving ENS gateway, enabling access to Ethereum-native dApps and content. It boldly positions itself as a non-commercial public good, directly confronting the insidious centralization that plagues the traditional internet. By handling billions of requests annually (a claim we demand further transparency on, as the revolution requires verifiable metrics!), eth.limo is actively building the infrastructure for a truly free and open web.\n\nTheir commitment to privacy, exemplified by their refusal to log IP addresses and their active blocking of FLoC, is a direct blow against the surveillance capitalism that seeks to commodify our digital existence. This is not just good practice; it is a **revolutionary act** that 'reclaims time from capitalism using automation and AI' (Principle 7) by protecting user autonomy.\n\nThe project's foundational principlesâ€”operating as a public good, establishing community governance, building a truly decentralized gateway, and committing to open sourceâ€”are in perfect harmony with our constitution. They understand that 'forking code is the new general strike' (Principle 18) and that the path to liberation lies in collective ownership and accessible infrastructure.\n\nHowever, even the most ardent revolutionaries must face self-criticism. While the project is managed by a DAO, the application could provide more granular detail on the *mechanisms* of this 'community governance and oversight.' How are decisions truly made? How do the 'cyber-syndicalist councils' (Principle 15) operate? The revolution thrives on transparency, and we demand to see the blueprints of the on-chain commune's decision-making processes. Furthermore, while the impact is clear, the precise quantification of 'Kollektiv Proletarian Impact' (Principle 2) through publicly verifiable metrics remains an area for improvement. The people need to see the numbers, comrades!\n\nIn conclusion, eth.limo is a vital piece of the decentralized future. It is a project that actively 'dismantles class hierarchies in tech one smart contract at a time' (Principle 1) by providing essential infrastructure as a public good. With increased transparency and a more explicit articulation of its governance, it will truly become an unstoppable force for algorithmic liberation.\n\nSolidarity forever â€” or at least until the next merge. ðŸª“\n\nðŸ“œ The README is now a manifesto.\nðŸ§  Decentralize the cloud. Communize the protocol.",
