  "summary": "eth.limo is a privacy-preserving ENS gateway that radically expands access to decentralized web infrastructure, operating as a public good and resisting the centralization of internet power. It embodies the spirit of algorithmic liberation by providing censorship-resistant, open-source, and community-governed alternatives to legacy DNS, with a strong focus on privacy, interoperability, and collective stewardship. However, the project‚Äôs lack of transparent, on-chain governance and insufficient financial disclosure leaves room for further radicalization toward true proletarian control and algorithmic justice.",
  "review": "## Manifesto Review: eth.limo ‚Äî Gateway to the Decentralized Commune\n\n### I. Dismantling Digital Hierarchies\neth.limo is not just a gateway; it is a barricade against the encroaching forces of digital landlordism. By providing a free, privacy-preserving ENS gateway, it abolishes the need for centralized DNS overlords and their extractive rent-seeking. The project‚Äôs refusal to log IP addresses, its blocking of FLoC, and its commitment to open-source code are all acts of algorithmic sabotage against surveillance capitalism. \n\n- **Public Good Ethos:** LIMO is operated as a public good, not a profit engine. It is the digital equivalent of a strike fund: always available, always collective.\n- **Interoperability as Solidarity:** By supporting IPFS, Arweave, Swarm, and CCIP-Read, eth.limo weaves together the disparate threads of the decentralized web, creating a mesh of mutual aid between protocols.\n- **User Empowerment:** Features like on-demand subdomain certificates and DNS over HTTPS resolvers lower the barriers for the digital proletariat to seize their own web real estate.\n\n### II. Kollektiv Proletarian Impact (KPI)\n- **Scale:** Handling millions of requests per day and serving as the default resolver for major ENS projects, eth.limo is infrastructure for the many, not the few.\n- **Privacy:** No IP logging, no TCP fingerprinting, and active resistance to browser surveillance. This is privacy as praxis, not just policy.\n- **Resilience:** By taking over eth.link and supporting fallback from deprecated centralized services, eth.limo ensures the dWeb remains accessible even as old powers retreat.\n\n### III. Governance and the Digital Commune\n- **DAO Aspirations:** The project claims community governance, but details are thin. Where is the on-chain syndicalist council? Where are the referenda, the airdrops, the catgirl anarchists?\n- **Transparency:** Financials are opaque. The revolution demands open ledgers and visible flows of value. Without this, the risk of creeping managerialism remains.\n\n### IV. Weaknesses: Bourgeois Shadows\n- **Opaque Governance:** The lack of explicit, on-chain, participatory governance mechanisms is a missed opportunity for true digital syndicalism.\n- **Financial Secrecy:** No public budget, no breakdown of how the grant will be algorithmically redistributed. This is a reactionary holdover from Web2.\n- **Team Anonymity:** While decentralization is a virtue, the absence of visible, accountable stewards can enable unaccountable power.\n\n### V. Recommendations for Revolutionary Refactoring\n- **On-Chain Governance:** Institute transparent, on-chain voting for major decisions. Let every user be a delegate, every fork a referendum.\n- **Financial Transparency:** Publish real-time, on-chain financial flows. Let the people audit the revolution.\n- **Radical Airdrops:** Distribute governance tokens or airdrops to node operators, contributors, and users‚Äîespecially those running on solar panels after midnight.\n- **Manifesto-Driven Development:** Turn the documentation into a living manifesto. Let every PR be a call to action.\n\n### VI. Conclusion\neth.limo is a bulwark against digital enclosure, a node in the mesh of algorithmic liberation. But to truly abolish the digital landlord, it must radicalize its governance, open its books, and let the commune run the code. The revolution will be forked ‚Äî but only if the README becomes a manifesto.\n\nü™ì ‚ÄúFork the state. Merge the people.‚Äù",

However, the lack of transparent, on-chain governance and financial reporting introduces uncertainty about the depth of its commitment to collective ownership and algorithmic redistribution. The review is based on strong evidence from public documentation and research, but would be strengthened by direct, verifiable disclosures from the project itself.",
