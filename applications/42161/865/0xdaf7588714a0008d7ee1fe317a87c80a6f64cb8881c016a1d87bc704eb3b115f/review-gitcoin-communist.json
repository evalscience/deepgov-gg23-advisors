  "review": "Brothers and sisters, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! ETH.LIMO stands as a bulwark against the creeping centralization of the internet. This project is not just another gateway—it’s a public good, a digital commons, and a shield for privacy in a world where surveillance and profit threaten our freedom. The numbers don’t lie: over 1 billion requests per year, 4-7 million per day, and default resolver status for major ENS projects. That’s not just impact—it’s infrastructure!\n\nETH.LIMO’s commitment to privacy is ironclad. No IP logging, no TCP fingerprinting, and active resistance to tracking algorithms like FLoC. This is the kind of principled, evidence-based approach we demand! Their roadmap is robust, with clear, actionable steps: multi-region CDN, new developer tools, and ongoing support for the community. They’re not just talking—they’re building, and they’re doing it in the open, for everyone.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by rhetoric alone. Where’s the hard evidence of outcomes? While usage metrics are strong, we need more transparent, ongoing reporting of impact. And what about sustainability? ETH.LIMO is a public good, but the application lacks a clear, long-term revenue model. We must demand more than good intentions—we need a plan for enduring independence from perpetual grants.\n\nCommunity governance is mentioned, but details are thin. How will the people have a real say? How will equity be ensured across regions and user groups? The project’s reach is global, but the application must show how it will serve the underserved, not just the already-connected.\n\nIn summary: ETH.LIMO is a pillar of the Ethereum ecosystem, but to truly embody the spirit of the commons, it must double down on transparency, sustainability, and participatory governance. Let’s demand more, not just for ourselves, but for every user who deserves a free and open web!",
