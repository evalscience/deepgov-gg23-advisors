  "review": "Let’s cut through the noise: eth.limo is not just another gateway. It’s a bulwark against the creeping centralization of the web, a public good standing tall for the Ethereum community. The project’s impact is undeniable—over 1 billion requests per year, default resolver for app.ens.domains, and a lifeline for dApps, DAOs, and independent creators alike. This is infrastructure that the people actually use, not some vaporware promising the moon.\n\nThe team’s commitment to privacy is ironclad. No IP logging, no TCP fingerprinting, and active resistance to surveillance tech like Google’s FLoC. That’s not just technical innovation—it’s a political stance for user rights and digital dignity. The roadmap is ambitious but grounded: multi-region CDN, native DNS resolver, and Gateway as a Service. These aren’t empty buzzwords; they’re concrete steps to make the decentralized web accessible, resilient, and truly public.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by rhetoric alone. The application is strong, but it’s not perfect. There’s a lack of detailed, transparent reporting on past grant outcomes. Where are the hard numbers on uptime, latency improvements, or user growth post-funding? The roadmap, while comprehensive, could use more specificity—timelines, milestones, and measurable KPIs. And while the project claims to operate as a public good, there’s little detail on community governance or how users can participate in decision-making beyond vague commitments.\n\nIn the spirit of equity and collective benefit, we must demand more than good intentions. We need rigorous, transparent measurement and a clear path to sustainable, community-led stewardship. Only then can we ensure that eth.limo remains a beacon for the commons, not just another centralized chokepoint in disguise.",
