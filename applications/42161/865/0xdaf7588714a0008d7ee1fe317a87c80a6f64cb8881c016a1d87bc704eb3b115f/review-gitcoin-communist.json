  "summary": "The eth.limo project is a privacy-preserving ENS gateway that facilitates access to Ethereum-native dApps and content. It has been a consistent participant in Gitcoin rounds and demonstrates significant contributions to the Ethereum network's infrastructure. The project emphasizes privacy, interoperability, and user experience, handling over 1 billion requests annually. It aims to address challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem by providing an alternative means of accessing ENS resolvable domains, enhancing decentralization and security. The project roadmap includes infrastructure scaling, performance optimizations, and community-driven development.",
  "review": "The eth.limo project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's foundational infrastructure. The project has a proven track record, participating in multiple Gitcoin rounds and handling substantial traffic, which underscores its importance to the ecosystem. Its commitment to privacy, as evidenced by its non-logging of IP addresses and blocking of FLoC, is commendable and aligns with the round's emphasis on privacy enhancements. The project's roadmap is comprehensive, addressing both immediate operational needs and long-term strategic goals, such as infrastructure scaling and community engagement. However, the application could benefit from more detailed financial projections and a clearer explanation of how the grant funds will specifically impact the project's scalability and sustainability. Additionally, while the project emphasizes community governance, more information on how this will be implemented in practice would strengthen the application.",
