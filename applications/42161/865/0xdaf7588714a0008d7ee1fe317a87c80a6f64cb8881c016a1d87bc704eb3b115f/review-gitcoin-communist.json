  "summary": "The eth.limo project is a privacy-preserving ENS gateway that facilitates access to Ethereum-native dApps and content. It has been a consistent participant in Gitcoin rounds and plays a significant role in the Ethereum ecosystem by handling over 1 billion requests annually. The project emphasizes privacy by not logging IP addresses and aims to enhance the performance and reliability of its services. It addresses the need for decentralized web access and aims to improve the user experience by providing an alternative to centralized internet infrastructure. The grant funds are intended to support operational capabilities, personnel, infrastructure scaling, and continued development efforts.",
  "review": "The eth.limo project presents a compelling case for funding, demonstrating a significant contribution to the Ethereum network's infrastructure. It handles a substantial volume of requests, indicating its importance and utility within the ecosystem. The project's focus on privacy, interoperability, and user experience aligns well with the round's eligibility criteria. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on measurable outcomes and a clearer sustainability model. The roadmap is comprehensive, but the project should provide more specifics on how it plans to achieve its goals and measure success. Overall, eth.limo is a strong candidate for funding, but improvements in transparency and sustainability planning are recommended.",
