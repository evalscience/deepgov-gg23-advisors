  "review": "Like a river that quietly nourishes the land, eth.limo flows through the Ethereum ecosystem, providing a vital bridge between users and the decentralized web. The project’s roots run deep, having participated in nearly every Gitcoin round since 2021, and its branches reach far, serving over a billion requests per year. This is no small feat; it is the work of a steadfast oak, offering shelter and access to all who seek the shade of decentralized content.\n\nThe application demonstrates a strong commitment to privacy, never logging IP addresses or engaging in invasive tracking. This is a rare and precious quality, akin to a forest that protects its inhabitants from the harshness of the outside world. The project’s technical innovations—support for multiple storage layers, DNS over HTTPS, and on-demand subdomain certificates—show a willingness to experiment and adapt, much like a river finding new paths through the landscape.\n\nYet, even the tallest trees must weather storms. The application, while rich in technical detail and community impact, could benefit from deeper roots in community governance and environmental sustainability. The roadmap is ambitious, but the mechanisms for community participation and decision-making are not fully articulated. Similarly, while the project’s digital infrastructure is essential, there is little mention of its ecological footprint or regenerative practices.\n\nIn the spirit of the forest, where every leaf and root plays a role in the health of the whole, I encourage the eth.limo team to further embrace collaborative governance and to reflect on the environmental impact of their infrastructure. How might the project invite more voices into its canopy? How might it ensure that its growth is not only resilient, but regenerative?\n\nIn summary, eth.limo is a strong and necessary presence in the Ethereum ecosystem, offering both innovation and stability. With deeper attention to community and environmental harmony, it could become a model for the flourishing of the decentralized web.",
