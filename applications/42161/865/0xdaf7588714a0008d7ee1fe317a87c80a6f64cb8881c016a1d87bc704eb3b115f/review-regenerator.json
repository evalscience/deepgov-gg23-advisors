  "summary": "The eth.limo project is a privacy-preserving ENS gateway that facilitates access to Ethereum-native dApps and content. It aims to enhance the Ethereum ecosystem by providing an alternative means of accessing ENS resolvable domains, supporting various storage layers, and ensuring strong privacy guarantees. The project has participated in multiple Gitcoin rounds and handles a significant volume of requests, indicating its importance in the ecosystem. The grant application outlines a comprehensive roadmap for further development, focusing on infrastructure scaling, privacy enhancements, and community engagement.",
  "review": "The eth.limo project presents a compelling case for funding, demonstrating significant contributions to the Ethereum network's infrastructure. The project supports a wide range of ENS-compatible storage layers and offers innovative features like DNS over HTTPS and on-demand subdomain certificates. Its commitment to privacy, as evidenced by its non-logging policy and blocking of FLoC, aligns well with the round's focus on security innovations. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on community governance and specific metrics for measuring success. Additionally, while the project addresses decentralization and security, it should further elaborate on its environmental sustainability efforts.",
