  "summary": "The eth.limo project is a privacy-preserving ENS gateway that facilitates access to Ethereum-native dApps and content. It aims to enhance the Ethereum ecosystem by providing an alternative means of accessing ENS resolvable domains, supporting various storage layers, and ensuring strong privacy guarantees. The project has participated in multiple Gitcoin rounds and handles significant traffic, indicating its importance in the ecosystem. The grant application outlines a comprehensive roadmap for further development, focusing on infrastructure scaling, privacy enhancements, and community engagement.",
  "review": "The eth.limo project presents a compelling case for funding, demonstrating significant contributions to the Ethereum network's infrastructure. It supports a wide range of ENS-compatible storage layers and offers privacy-preserving features, such as not logging IP addresses. The project addresses key challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as the need for decentralized access to dWebsites and the lack of non-commercial infrastructure. The roadmap is detailed and aligns with the round's focus on enhancing privacy, interoperability, and user experience. However, the application could benefit from more specific metrics and examples of past achievements to strengthen its case.",
