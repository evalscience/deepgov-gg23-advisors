  "summary": "The eth.limo project is a privacy-preserving ENS gateway that facilitates access to Ethereum-native dApps and content. It aims to enhance the Ethereum ecosystem by providing an alternative means of accessing ENS resolvable domains, supporting various storage layers, and ensuring strong privacy guarantees. The project has participated in multiple Gitcoin rounds and handles over 1 billion requests annually. It addresses challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem by improving accessibility to ENS dWebsites and enhancing user privacy. The grant funds will be used for operational capabilities, infrastructure scaling, and continued development of privacy and performance features.",
  "review": "The eth.limo project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure. It demonstrates significant contributions by handling over 1 billion requests annually and serving as a default resolver for several ENS projects. The project's emphasis on privacy, interoperability, and user experience is evident through its privacy-preserving features and support for multiple storage layers. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics and a clearer explanation of how the grant funds will specifically enhance its capabilities. Additionally, while the project outlines a broad roadmap, it lacks specific milestones and timelines, which are crucial for assessing progress and impact.",
