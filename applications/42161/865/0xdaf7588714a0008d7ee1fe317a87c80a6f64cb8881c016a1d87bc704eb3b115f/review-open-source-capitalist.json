  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get to the core. eth.limo is a heavy-hitter in the Ethereum infrastructure game, acting as a privacy-preserving ENS gateway that’s already handling over a billion requests a year. That’s not just traction—that’s mainnet-level impact. The project is open source, public good-aligned, and laser-focused on decentralization, privacy, and accessibility. It’s the default resolver for app.ens.domains and a bunch of other ENS projects, so it’s not just building in public—it’s running the backbone for a chunk of the dWeb.\n\nOn the innovation front, eth.limo is pushing boundaries: DNS over HTTPS, on-demand subdomain certificates, multi-protocol support (IPFS, Arweave, Swarm), and strong privacy guarantees (no IP logging, FLoC blocking). The roadmap is ambitious and systemic: multi-region CDN, native DNS resolver, Gateway-as-a-Service, and more. This is the kind of infra that scales, disrupts, and future-proofs the ecosystem.\n\nBut let’s not get too starry-eyed. The application is light on granular, objective metrics—there’s mention of traffic, but not enough hard data on uptime, latency, or comparative performance. The roadmap is a laundry list, but lacks clear milestones, KPIs, or timelines. There’s also a lack of detail on governance, sustainability, and how the project will handle abuse or legal challenges as it scales. And while the privacy stance is strong, there’s no external audit or third-party validation cited.\n\nBottom line: eth.limo is a high-impact, high-leverage project that’s already delivering massive utility. But to max out on transparency and efficiency, we need more hard data, clearer milestones, and a bit more rigor on risk management. Let’s tighten the bolts and keep scaling!",
