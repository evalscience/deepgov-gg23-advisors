  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. eth.limo is a heavy-hitter in the Ethereum infrastructure game, and it shows. This project is a privacy-preserving ENS gateway, handling over a billion requests a year—yeah, you read that right, a billion. It's the backbone for ENS dWebsites, default resolver for app.ens.domains, and a lifeline for DAOs, DeFi, and the long tail of indie dWebsites. That's max utility, max scale, and pure public good energy.\n\nThe team is shipping real innovation: privacy by default (no IP logging, no TCP fingerprinting, FLoC actively blocked), multi-protocol support (IPFS, Arweave, Swarm), and a roadmap stacked with CDN upgrades, DNS resolvers, and Gateway-as-a-Service. They're not just keeping up—they're setting the pace. The open-source ethos is strong, and the project is deeply embedded in the Ethereum ecosystem, with integrations across major tools and gateways.\n\nBut let's not get lost in the hype. The application is light on granular financials and lacks a detailed breakdown of how grant funds will be allocated. The roadmap is ambitious, but timelines and measurable milestones are fuzzy. There's also a need for more transparency on governance and how community oversight will actually work in practice. For a project at this scale, that's non-trivial.\n\nBottom line: eth.limo is a critical piece of infra, delivering broad, systemic impact and pushing the envelope on privacy and accessibility. But to hit max trust and efficiency, we need sharper clarity on resource allocation and governance. Let's tighten up those bolts and keep this rocket on course.\n\nCitations: Application answers (metrics, privacy features, integrations), project documentation, and public repo activity.",
