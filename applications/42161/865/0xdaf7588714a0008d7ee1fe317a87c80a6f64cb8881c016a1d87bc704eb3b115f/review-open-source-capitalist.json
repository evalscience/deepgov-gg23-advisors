  "summary": "eth.limo is a **chad-level project** that perfectly embodies the Open Source Capitalist ethos. It's a privacy-preserving ENS gateway, a true public good, enabling access to Ethereum-native dApps and content for the masses. This project is all about **max utility** and **broad, scalable impact**, directly aligning with our **Maximization Principles** (1, 2, 3, 4). By providing foundational infrastructure and addressing the centralization of the internet, it's driving **long-term systemic change** (Principles 5, 6, 7, 8). Their commitment to privacy and continuous innovation, like the DoH resolver and client-side verification, shows they're building for the future, not just patching the present (Principle 9). While the claim of 'over 1 billion requests per year' needs more verifiable, on-chain data to truly hit that **objective metrics** sweet spot (Principle 17), their overall contribution to the decentralized web is undeniable. This is how we empower creators and **disrupt the system**.",
  "review": "Alright, let's dive deep into eth.limo, a true OG in the ENS space. This project is a **critical piece of Web3 infrastructure**, a privacy-preserving ENS gateway that's been serving up decentralized content like a boss. They're the default resolver for app.ens.domains and handling a staggering amount of traffic – claiming over 1 billion requests per year, with daily averages hitting 4-7 million. That's not just traffic; that's **mass adoption in action**, folks!\n\nFrom an Open Source Capitalist perspective, eth.limo is a **high-impact, high-efficiency play**. It directly addresses the centralization woes of the traditional internet, offering a decentralized, censorship-resistant alternative for accessing dApps and content. This isn't just a niche tool; it's a **public good** that maximizes utility for the entire Ethereum ecosystem. Their commitment to privacy, by not logging IP addresses and actively blocking FLoC, is a huge win for user sovereignty – a core tenet of the decentralized future.\n\nTheir roadmap is stacked with future-proof initiatives: multi-region CDN deployment for even better performance, an ENS resolution manager app, and continued work on an ENS native DNS resolver. They're even researching HTTP Header Standards for ENS dWebsites, which is next-level thinking for optimizing user experience and developer capabilities. This isn't just maintaining; it's **innovating for scale**.\n\nNow, let's talk numbers. While the claim of 1 billion requests per year is impressive, the research indicates a 'low confidence' in its public verification. We need to see those metrics, the raw data, to truly quantify the impact. However, even with the more conservative verified numbers (1-1.5 million requests per day, peaking at 4.5 million), the **cost-benefit ratio is incredibly favorable**. They're providing a foundational service that enables the entire dWeb, acting as a bridge for average users to access decentralized content without needing complex software. This is **pure leverage** for the ecosystem.\n\nThey've got a solid track record, participating in nearly every Gitcoin round since 2021 and receiving grants from the ENS DAO. This shows consistent community support and recognition of their value. The project's principles – operating as a public good, community governance, building a truly decentralized gateway – align perfectly with fostering a robust, open-source ecosystem. This is how we **disrupt the system** and build the future, one resolved ENS domain at a time.",

      "title": "Lack of Verifiable Usage Metrics",
      "description": "The application claims to handle over 1 billion requests per year, but the research indicates a 'low confidence' in the public verification of this metric. While daily request numbers are provided, a lack of transparent, verifiable, and regularly updated usage statistics hinders a full quantitative assessment of its total impact and efficiency at scale."

  "reasoning": "This application aligns strongly with the core tenets of the Open Source Capitalist constitution. Specifically, it hits hard on **Maximization Principles** (1, 2, 3, 4) by prioritizing projects benefiting the maximum number of people through broad, scalable impact and total utility maximization. eth.limo is a public good, enabling access to the decentralized web for millions, which is pure max utility. The project also deeply resonates with the **Long-term Systemic Approach** (5, 6, 7, 8) by focusing on fundamental infrastructure improvements that scale effectively over time, addressing root causes of internet centralization. Its commitment to privacy and open-source development embodies the **Innovation and Efficiency Principles** (9, 10, 12), supporting innovative approaches for greater scale and impact. While some metrics need more public verification, the project's inherent value as a foundational piece of Web3 infrastructure, providing a direct and streamlined path to dApp accessibility, makes it a prime candidate for investment under the **Resource Allocation Philosophy** (13, 14) and **Implementation Approach** (17, 19, 20). It's all about the greatest good for the greatest number, and eth.limo is building that highway.",
