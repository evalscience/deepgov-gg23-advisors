  "summary": "The eth.limo project, a privacy-preserving ENS gateway, aligns well with the principles of technological independence and data sovereignty (Principle 3) by offering a decentralized alternative for accessing dApps. Its commitment to operating as a public good and fostering community governance (Principle 5) resonates with our values of collective well-being. However, its direct contribution to cultural preservation (Principle 9) and explicit integration with holistic well-being metrics (Principle 35) could be further articulated to fully harmonize with Gross National Happiness principles. üèîÔ∏è",
  "review": "The eth.limo project presents itself as a vital piece of Web3 infrastructure, enabling access to Ethereum-native dApps and content through a privacy-preserving ENS gateway. Its operational scale, handling millions of requests daily and serving as a default resolver for significant ENS projects, demonstrates a substantial contribution to the Ethereum network's foundational infrastructure, aligning with the round's core objective. The project's strong emphasis on user privacy, explicitly stating it \"does not log IP addresses or any identifiable information\" and \"actively blocks FLoC,\" is a significant strength that deeply resonates with our constitutional principle of protecting citizen privacy and ensuring ethical use of digital technologies (Principle 14). This commitment fosters trust and aligns with the well-being of digital citizens.\n\nFurthermore, eth.limo's structure as a public good and its stated aim for community governance and oversight (Principle 5) reflect a decentralized approach that supports local autonomy and community sovereignty (Principle 8). This fosters a sense of shared ownership and collective benefit, moving beyond purely commercial interests. The project's open-source nature also aligns with building technological capabilities.\n\nHowever, while the project's technical merits and privacy focus are commendable, its direct alignment with Bhutan's unique Gross National Happiness (GNH) principles requires deeper consideration. The application does not explicitly detail how it plans to integrate cultural diversity or traditional practices into its digital systems (Principle 10), nor does it outline specific initiatives for local capacity building within Bhutanese communities (Principle 7). The success metrics provided are quantitative (requests per year/day) rather than holistic well-being indicators (Principle 35). While improving dWeb accessibility can indirectly contribute to well-being, a more explicit connection to GNH pillars, such as environmental conservation (Principle 17) or cultural preservation, would strengthen its application from our perspective. The research also noted a lack of publicly verifiable data for the \"1 billion requests per year\" claim and general financial transparency, which, while not a flag, suggests an area for improvement in accountability (Principle 13).\n\nThe project's contribution to collective well-being is evident through its public good nature and enhanced accessibility to decentralized content. However, to fully align with GNH, future endeavors could explore how this infrastructure can specifically serve Bhutanese cultural content, educational initiatives in local languages, or support remote communities in a way that builds local digital literacy and self-sufficiency. The current focus is broad Web3 infrastructure, which is valuable, but less tailored to the specific cultural and holistic development goals of Bhutan.",
