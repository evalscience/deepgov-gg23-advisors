  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Lakat steps forward with a vision: to break the chains of centralized academic publishing and anchor the iterative, collaborative process of science in the Ethereum ecosystem. This is not just another DeFi clone or a token pump — it’s a bold attempt to diversify Ethereum’s utility, bringing the power of open, permissionless collaboration to the world of research and knowledge production.\n\nThe project’s architecture is inspired by git, supporting multi-branched, edit-centric publishing. It leverages Ethereum for data anchoring, Ceramic for storage, and Starknet for proofs. The roadmap is clear: build a Rust client, integrate with MediaWiki, and test with real academics. The team is public, the code is open, and the whitepaper is available for all to scrutinize.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by ambition alone! Where is the hard evidence of impact? Where are the metrics showing adoption, usage, or measurable improvement in the Ethereum infrastructure? The application speaks of plans and pivots, but offers little in the way of quantifiable results. The social key recovery feature is promising, but still in development. The roadmap is ambitious, but timelines are slipping — Q3 2024 for the Rust client, yet we’re in Q2 2025 with no clear update.\n\nSustainability? The application does not address how Lakat will sustain itself beyond grants. There’s no mention of a revenue model, community governance structure, or long-term maintenance plan. This is a glaring omission for any project seeking to build public goods for the many, not the few.\n\nIn summary: Lakat is a project with vision and technical depth, but it must deliver evidence, sustainability, and transparency if it wants to earn the trust — and the resources — of the people. The revolution in publishing will not be funded on dreams alone!",
