  "review": "Comrades, let’s get straight to the heart of the matter! Lakat steps forward with a vision to break the chains of centralized academic publishing, anchoring its protocol in the Ethereum ecosystem. The project’s ambition is clear: to build a permissionless, collaborative, and pluralistic infrastructure for scientific publishing, leveraging Ethereum’s security and composability. This is the kind of bold, public-good infrastructure our movement needs!\n\nBut let’s not be swept away by rhetoric alone. The application demonstrates a strong alignment with the round’s goals: it’s open-source, it’s building core infrastructure, and it’s pushing for decentralization beyond DeFi. The technical roadmap is detailed, with a Rust client, a MediaWiki extension, and integration with Ceramic and Starknet. The team is transparent, with public repositories and a clear list of contributors. This is the transparency and collective ownership we demand!\n\nYet, comrades, we must be vigilant. The application lacks hard, measurable outcomes. Where are the metrics? Where is the evidence of adoption, usage, or impact? The roadmap is ambitious, but there’s little proof of delivery or sustainability. The project’s revenue model is not discussed, and there’s no clear plan for long-term maintenance beyond grant funding. We must demand more than dreams—we need data, sustainability, and proof!\n\nFurthermore, while the project claims to enhance privacy and interoperability, the details are vague. The social key recovery concept is promising, but it’s still in the ideation phase. We need rigorous evaluation, not just speculation. The application also does not address geographic equity or how it will serve underserved communities. If we are to build for the many, not the few, these gaps must be filled!\n\nIn summary: Lakat is a promising, community-driven project with a strong vision and technical foundation. But to earn the people’s trust—and our resources—it must provide clear, measurable outcomes, a sustainable model, and a plan for equitable impact. Let’s demand nothing less!",
