Lakat supports continuous integration of scientific research across multiple branches through a proof-of-review consensus mechanism. It integrates with the Ethereum ecosystem in several ways: Storage, tokens and proofs. The storage of content will be anchored in Ethereum through the ceramic protocol. Each branch has an option to interact with a branch token whose utility emerges from the usages within a branch. Proofs of data submission will be deployed as contracts on Starknet, a zk-rollup over Ethereum. Lakat's architecture allows for the necessary flexibility to grow and to allow for the integration of existing reputation systems and incentive structures or facilitate the development of new ones.\n\n## About \nPlease read more about the protocol on [the lakat.science page](https://lakat.science).
