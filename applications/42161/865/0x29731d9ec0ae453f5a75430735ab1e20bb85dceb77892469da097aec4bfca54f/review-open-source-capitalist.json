  "review": "Alright, let's plug into the Lakat protocol and see if it’s ready to disrupt the Ethereum infrastructure meta! Lakat’s aiming to be the Git for decentralized science publishing—anchoring data on Ethereum, leveraging Ceramic for storage, and rolling out proof-of-review consensus on Starknet. That’s a bold play for broadening Ethereum’s utility beyond DeFi, and it’s got the right open-source DNA. The roadmap is public, the code’s on GitHub, and the team’s building in Rust (max performance, love it). \n\nOn the innovation front, Lakat’s social key recovery and multi-branch publishing are spicy—if they can pull off trustless key recovery and incentivized collaboration, that’s a real UX win. The project’s also gunning for interoperability by anchoring to multiple EVM chains and integrating with existing reputation systems. That’s the kind of composability the ecosystem needs.\n\nBut let’s not sugarcoat it: the app is light on hard metrics and adoption data. There’s no clear evidence of user traction, no quantifiable impact, and the roadmap is a bit hand-wavy on deliverables and timelines. The grant asks for trust in the vision, but doesn’t back it up with KPIs, usage stats, or a breakdown of how funds will be spent. For a round focused on foundational infra, that’s a red flag. \n\nBottom line: Lakat’s got the right vision and tech stack, but needs to show more receipts. Show me the numbers, the users, and the impact, and I’ll be all in. Until then, it’s a promising experiment, not a proven infra pillar. Max utility demands max transparency and accountability!",
