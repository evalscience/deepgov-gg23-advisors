  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Ethereum on ARM is not just another tech project — it’s a rallying cry for decentralization, accessibility, and the power of the people to run the network from their own homes. This project smashes the myth that you need deep pockets or corporate backing to participate in Ethereum’s infrastructure. By enabling full, archive, staking, and L2 nodes on affordable ARM64 and RISC-V boards, they’re putting the tools of power back in the hands of the many, not the few.\n\nThe evidence is clear: they’ve shipped real, working solutions. Mainnet deployments, DVT integration, and support for the most popular single-board computers — all open source, all verifiable. They’re not just talking; they’re doing. Their roadmap is public, their code is public, and their impact is measurable: more nodes, more diversity, more resilience for Ethereum. This is the kind of infrastructure that keeps the network strong, decentralized, and out of the hands of oligarchs.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by sentiment. We must demand more: Where are the hard numbers? How many nodes are running? What’s the growth rate? How many new stakers have joined thanks to this work? The project’s sustainability model is also unclear — are they building toward a future where they don’t need to pass the hat every round? And while their commitment to open hardware is inspiring, we need more transparency on governance and community participation. Who decides the roadmap? How are voices from the global south, from marginalized communities, being included?\n\nIn summary: Ethereum on ARM is a beacon for the working class of Web3, but to earn the people’s trust — and the people’s funds — they must show us the receipts, build a path to sustainability, and open the doors wider for global participation. Let’s demand nothing less!",
