  "review": "Comrades, let’s get straight to the heart of the matter! Ethereum on ARM is a project that doesn’t just talk decentralization — it builds it, brick by brick, on the backs of affordable, accessible hardware. This is the kind of infrastructure work that keeps the Ethereum network in the hands of the many, not the few. The project’s open-source ethos, clear documentation, and history of participation in prior rounds show a commitment to the public good, not private profit.\n\nThe application demonstrates a strong, measurable impact: enabling full, archive, and staking nodes on $300 ARM64 boards, consuming just 10 watts of power. That’s not just technical progress — that’s a blow against the centralization of power and wealth! The roadmap is clear, with milestones like Lido Community Staking Module deployment, DVT integration, and RISC-V development. These are not empty promises; they’re backed by public repositories, documentation, and active community channels.\n\nBut let’s not get carried away by sentiment. Where’s the hard data? The application could do more to provide quantifiable metrics: How many nodes are running? What’s the geographic distribution? How many new stakers have joined thanks to this work? We need numbers, not just narratives, to measure true impact and ensure equitable benefit.\n\nSustainability is another concern. While the project lowers barriers and energy costs, there’s little mention of a revenue model or long-term financial independence. Are we building a movement that can stand on its own, or one that will always need a handout? The people deserve answers!\n\nFinally, while the project’s governance is rooted in open-source principles, there’s little detail on how decisions are made, how the community is empowered, or how equity across regions is ensured. We must demand transparency and collective ownership, not just technical prowess.\n\nIn summary: Ethereum on ARM is a powerful force for decentralization and equity in Ethereum infrastructure. But to truly serve the people, it must show us the numbers, build a path to sustainability, and open its governance to the many, not the few. Let’s demand more — for the network, for the community, for the future!",
