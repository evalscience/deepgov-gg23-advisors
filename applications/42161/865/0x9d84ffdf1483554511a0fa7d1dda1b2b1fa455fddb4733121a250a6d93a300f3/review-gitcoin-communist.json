  "summary": "The Ethereum on ARM project aims to democratize access to Ethereum node operation by enabling users to run full, archive, staking, and L2 nodes on affordable ARM64 boards. This initiative supports decentralization by lowering the barriers to entry for node operation, thus promoting a more inclusive Ethereum network. The project has a clear roadmap focusing on expanding hardware support, integrating Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), and maintaining infrastructure. It aligns with the round's goals by contributing significantly to Ethereum's infrastructure and demonstrating pioneering development in decentralization and accessibility.",
  "review": "The Ethereum on ARM project presents a compelling case for funding, aligning well with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure. The project addresses key challenges in decentralization by enabling node operation on low-cost, energy-efficient ARM64 boards, thus broadening participation beyond large institutional players. This approach supports the constitutional principles of equitable distribution and community benefit, as it empowers individual stakers and enhances network resilience.\n\nThe project demonstrates significant contributions to Ethereum's infrastructure by providing a cost-effective solution for running nodes, which is crucial for decentralization and security. The integration of DVT further enhances validator uptime and fault tolerance, addressing critical issues in the staking ecosystem. The roadmap is well-structured, with clear objectives and impacts outlined for each initiative, such as the Lido Community Staking Module and RISC-V development.\n\nHowever, the application could benefit from more detailed evidence of past achievements and measurable outcomes to strengthen its case. While the project outlines its pioneering work, providing specific metrics or case studies would enhance its credibility and align with the evidence and measurement principles. Additionally, a clearer explanation of the project's sustainability model would address concerns about long-term viability and reduce dependency on continuous donations.\n\nOverall, Ethereum on ARM is a strong candidate for funding, with its focus on decentralization, accessibility, and infrastructure development aligning well with the round's objectives and constitutional principles.",
