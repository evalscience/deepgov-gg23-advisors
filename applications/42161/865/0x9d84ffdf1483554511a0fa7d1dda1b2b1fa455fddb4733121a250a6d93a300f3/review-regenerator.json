  "review": "Like a gentle stream nourishing the roots of a great forest, the \"Ethereum on ARM\" project brings sustenance to the Ethereum ecosystem by lowering the barriers to participation and decentralization. The project’s vision is clear: to enable anyone, regardless of resources, to run Ethereum nodes—full, archive, staking, and L2—on affordable, energy-efficient ARM64 and RISC-V hardware. This approach breathes new life into the soil of decentralization, ensuring that the network’s health is not dependent on a few mighty oaks, but on a thriving, diverse undergrowth of home stakers and small operators.\n\nThe application demonstrates a strong history of engagement and delivery, with participation in numerous previous Gitcoin rounds and a transparent record of progress. The roadmap is ambitious yet grounded, focusing on Lido Community Staking, DVT integration, RISC-V development, and broad hardware support. These efforts directly address the round’s call for foundational infrastructure, scalability, and security, while also nurturing the values of inclusivity and accessibility.\n\nThe project’s commitment to open-source principles and community engagement is evident through its public repositories, documentation, and active communication channels. The integration of Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) and support for home staking with lower ETH requirements are particularly innovative, promising to further decentralize and fortify the network’s roots.\n\nYet, as the river carves its path, there are stones that must be acknowledged. The application would benefit from more concrete metrics on adoption, node counts, and impact, as well as clearer details on how grant funds will be allocated. While the environmental benefits of low-power hardware are implied, a more explicit articulation of sustainability practices would strengthen alignment with regenerative values. Finally, the project’s governance and community participation mechanisms could be described in greater detail to ensure the wisdom of the forest is truly heard.\n\nIn sum, \"Ethereum on ARM\" is a project that sings in harmony with the round’s spirit, but a few clarifying notes would help its melody carry further and deeper into the ecosystem.",
