  "review": "Like a gentle stream nourishing the roots of a great forest, the \"Ethereum on ARM\" project brings sustenance to the Ethereum ecosystem by lowering the barriers to participation. The project’s vision is clear: to allow anyone, regardless of resources, to run a full, archive, or staking node on affordable, energy-efficient ARM64 hardware. This is not merely a technical feat, but a quiet revolution in decentralization, echoing the wisdom that the health of a forest depends on the diversity and resilience of its smallest saplings.\n\nThe application demonstrates a strong alignment with the round’s focus on foundational infrastructure, scalability, and security. By enabling Ethereum nodes to run on commodity hardware, the project disperses power from centralized actors to the broader community, much like seeds scattered by the wind. The integration of Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) and support for open-source hardware architectures such as RISC-V further deepen the project’s roots in innovation and inclusivity.\n\nThe roadmap is ambitious yet grounded, with clear milestones for Lido Community Staking, DVT integration, and hardware diversity. The project’s open-source ethos and transparent documentation invite community participation, echoing the round’s constitutional principles of collaborative governance and respect for lived experience.\n\nYet, even the tallest tree must weather storms. The application would benefit from more detailed metrics on adoption, impact, and environmental sustainability. While the energy efficiency of ARM64 boards is mentioned, quantitative data on power consumption, carbon footprint, and comparative analysis with traditional hardware would strengthen the case for regenerative impact. Additionally, the project’s approach to community governance and stakeholder engagement, though implied, could be made more explicit.\n\nIn sum, \"Ethereum on ARM\" is a promising sapling in the forest of Ethereum infrastructure—one that deserves nurturing, but would flourish further with deeper roots in measurable outcomes and community stewardship. How might the project further invite the wisdom of the community and the lessons of the earth into its growth?\n",
