By lowering these barriers, we ensure that both Ethereum L1 and L2 nodes can be operated by any user from home. This accessibility is important for enhancing the decentralization, security, and scalability of the Ethereum network.  \n\nWithout this reference, the hardware requirements and costs associated with running a node could increase, potentially restricting participation to only those with more resources. This would undermine the core principles of decentralization and inclusivity that are fundamental to the Ethereum ecosystem. By keeping node operation accessible and affordable, we help preserve Ethereum's resilience and long-term viability as a decentralized network.  \n\nWe provide the essential infrastructure for running a home validator, enabling anyone to become a home staker using low-powered and affordable hardware. In the coming weeks, we will support protocols that will allow staking with less than 32 ETH lowering even more the barrier to home staking. DVT technology is also available, ensuring home stakers can collaborate with other nodes to keep their validators online.  \n\nWe see our boards as the final frontier in commodity hardware. If Ethereum can run on these devices, which are affordable and energy-efficient, then we are in good shape for decentralization. If not, we may have a problem about running nodes on home hardware. \n\nThe fact that 9 years after Ethereum release it is still possible running a full/archive/staking node on a 185$ board means that it is the most decentralized blockchain.

      "description": "Join us in running a **$300 preconfigured Ethereum Full/Archive/Staking node** on ARM64 boards, consuming only 10 watts of power.\n\n**Ethereum on ARM** provides a PnP Ubuntu Armbian image for the NanoPC-T6, Rock 5B, Orange Pi 5 Plus, and Raspberry Pi 5 that sets up an L1 and/or L2 node.  It **automatically turns the device into an ARM64 Full/Archive Ethereum node or a home Staking box**. \n\nOur main goal is to **lower the barriers of running an Ethereum L1 or L2 node** by automating complex processes, ultimately encouraging more users to participate in the network. This contributes directly to **network decentralization**. \n\nAdditionally, our work empowers developers by providing them with the tools necessary to run a development or testing node and end-users to use their nodes for their daily operations. \n\nWe provide the infrastructure needed for users to run Ethereum nodes (both L1 and L2) on single ARM64 boards. With our setup, users can run: \n\n- Full nodes \n- Archive nodes \n- Staking nodes \n- L2 nodes \n- Supernodes (L1+L2) on a single board \n\nIn the coming weeks, users will be able to leverage **DVT technology** to keep their validators online by collaborating with other stakers. \n\nThis is our **Roadmap** for the coming months: \n\n**1. Lido Community Staking Module Deployment**\n**Objective**: Enable staking with 2 ETH/stETH or less through the Lido Community Staking Module. \n**Status**: Ethereum on ARM Lido validators running on mainnet. \n**Impact**: Lower the entry barrier for stakers, opening access to Ethereum staking for smaller participants and increasing decentralization. \n\n**2. DVT Integration Obol Network** \n**Objective:** Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) integration using Obol Network. \n**Status**: Mainnet . \n**Impact:** Improve validator uptime and fault tolerance by allowing stakers to collaborate, ensuring validators remain online through nodes redundancy. \n\nSee:\n\nhttps://x.com/EthereumOnARM/status/1897261587427418436\n\n**3. RISC-V Development** \n**Objective:** Continue RISC-V architecture development, focusing on expanding Ethereum node capabilities on open-source hardware platforms. \n**Status:** Waiting for a 16 GB RAM board. \n**Impact:** Expanding hardware diversity within the ecosystem. \n\n**4. Expanding L2 Support (Fuel Network)** \n**Objective:** Add support for additional Layer 2 Fuel Network. \n**Status:** Mainnet already running \n**Impact:** Improve scalability by supporting more L2 solutions. \n\n**6. Raspberry Pi 5 support** \n**Objective:** Add support for Raspberry Pi 5 16 GB RAM \n**Status:** Completed.\n**Impact:** Improve hardware diversity by supporting the most popular ARM64 Board. See:\n\nhttps://x.com/EthereumOnARM/status/1889297438101434374\n\n**6. Infrastructure Maintenance** \n**Objective:** Continuously maintain the existing infrastructure, including OS images and client updates. \n\n\nThanks for your donations and support. \n\n**Our Repository** \n\n[https://github.com/EOA-Blockchain-Labs/ethereumonarm/](https://github.com/EOA-Blockchain-Labs/ethereumonarm) \n\n**Documentation Page**\n\n[https://ethereum-on-arm-documentation.readthedocs.io](https://ethereum-on-arm-documentation.readthedocs.io) \n\n**Discord Channel** \n\n[http://discord.gg/ve2Z8fxz5N](http://discord.gg/ve2Z8fxz5N) \n\n**Check our Twitter Account for Updates** \n\n[https://twitter.com/EthereumOnARM](https://twitter.com/EthereumOnARM) \n\n*Ethereum on ARM is an EOA Blockchain Labs, S.L.
