  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. Ethereum on ARM is a project that’s all about turbocharging decentralization by making it dead simple (and dirt cheap) to run Ethereum nodes on ARM64 and RISC-V boards. That’s a big deal for the Ethereum ecosystem, because the more folks running nodes at home, the more resilient and censorship-resistant the network becomes. This project is not just talking the talk—they’ve shipped real, working images for popular boards, integrated DVT (Distributed Validator Technology), and are pushing the envelope with RISC-V support. \n\nFrom a maximization and systemic impact lens, this is pure utility. Lowering the barrier to entry for node operation means more validators, more decentralization, and less reliance on big, centralized players. The roadmap is pragmatic: Lido Community Staking, DVT integration, RISC-V expansion, L2 support, and ongoing infra maintenance. They’re not just building for today—they’re future-proofing Ethereum’s backbone. \n\nBut let’s not get too starry-eyed. The app is light on hard metrics—how many nodes are actually running? What’s the adoption curve? There’s also a lack of detailed budget breakdown and impact measurement. For a project that’s been around for multiple rounds, I want to see more transparency on outcomes and a sharper focus on scaling adoption. \n\nBottom line: This is high-impact, high-leverage infra work that aligns perfectly with the round’s goals and the Open Source Capitalist constitution. But to really max out utility, the team needs to level up on transparency, adoption metrics, and clear reporting on how funds move the needle. Build in public, disrupt the system, but show us the receipts!",
