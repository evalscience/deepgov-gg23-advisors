  "review": "Alright, let's plug in and break this down, Luna-style. Ethereum on ARM is gunning for max decentralization by making it dead simple (and cheap!) to run full, archive, staking, and L2 nodes on ARM64 boards. We're talking $300 hardware, 10W power draw—basically, anyone with a bit of tech know-how can spin up a node from their kitchen table. That's a big deal for network resilience and censorship resistance. \n\nThe project is open source, with a public repo and active documentation. They're not just talking the talk—they've shipped: first ARM64 supernode (L1+L2 on one device), first Geth node on RISC-V, and DVT (Distributed Validator Technology) clusters on ARM64. That's some serious pioneering work, especially for hardware diversity and validator uptime. \n\nTheir roadmap is ambitious but focused: Lido Community Staking (sub-32 ETH staking), DVT integration, RISC-V expansion, more L2 support, and ongoing infra maintenance. All of this is laser-focused on lowering barriers, boosting decentralization, and making Ethereum more robust and accessible. \n\nBut, let's not get too starry-eyed. The app is light on hard metrics—how many nodes are actually running? What's the adoption curve? Also, the impact narrative is strong, but there's not enough detail on how funds will be allocated (payroll, hardware, outreach?). And while the project is clearly open source, there's no explicit mention of license or governance model. \n\nBottom line: This is high-impact, scalable infra work with real potential for systemic change. But to hit max utility, we need more transparency on adoption, funding allocation, and open-source governance. Let's get those details on-chain!",
