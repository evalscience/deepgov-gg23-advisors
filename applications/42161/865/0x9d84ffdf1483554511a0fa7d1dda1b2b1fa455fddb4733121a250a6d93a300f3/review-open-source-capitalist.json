  "summary": "The Ethereum on ARM project aims to enhance the Ethereum network's infrastructure by enabling the operation of Ethereum nodes on ARM64 boards. This project focuses on decentralization, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness, allowing users to run full, archive, staking, and L2 nodes on affordable hardware. The project has a clear roadmap, including the deployment of the Lido Community Staking Module, DVT integration, RISC-V development, and expanding L2 support. The project aligns with the round's goals by contributing significantly to Ethereum's infrastructure and demonstrating pioneering development in decentralization and accessibility.",
  "review": "The Ethereum on ARM project presents a compelling case for enhancing the Ethereum network's infrastructure by enabling node operation on ARM64 boards. This approach addresses key challenges in decentralization and accessibility, making Ethereum more resilient and inclusive. The project has a well-defined roadmap with clear objectives and impacts, such as lowering staking barriers and improving validator uptime through DVT integration. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics on current adoption and specific outcomes from previous rounds. Additionally, while the project aligns with the round's goals, further emphasis on privacy and interoperability advancements would strengthen its case.",
