  "review": "The Abundance Protocol dares to dream big — a world where builders and creators are rewarded for their impact, not just their profit. But dreams alone do not build infrastructure! Let’s cut through the rhetoric and see if this project truly delivers for the Ethereum commons.\n\nFirst, the project’s core claim: creating a self-sustaining public goods funding mechanism, moving beyond the charity model of QF and RetroPGF. This is a noble goal, and the team has distributed over 2 million $degen to contributors on Farcaster. That’s a concrete metric, but is it enough? Where is the evidence of long-term, system-wide impact? Where are the dashboards, the data, the proof that this model can scale and sustain itself without perpetual grant dependency?\n\nThe application touts an innovative “impact market” and a Proof-of-Impact Value Consensus. Yet, the details are buried in a whitepaper, not in the application itself. There’s talk of aligning incentives and preventing sybil attacks, but no rigorous evaluation, no transparent reporting of outcomes, and no clear measurement framework. The roadmap is vague: “integrate more mechanisms” and “full-time development.” Where are the milestones, the KPIs, the sustainability plan? The project claims to address the free-rider problem, but offers no evidence of a working, sustainable revenue model.\n\nOn governance, the project is led by a founder with a background in economics and web3, but there’s little mention of community governance structures or how the protocol will ensure equitable participation and benefit distribution. The focus is on the developer, not the collective. This is a red flag for any project claiming to serve the public good.\n\nLet’s be clear: the Ethereum ecosystem needs bold experiments in public goods funding. But we must demand more than vision and rhetoric. We need evidence, structure, and accountability. The Abundance Protocol is promising, but it must prove it can deliver measurable, sustainable, and equitable impact for the many — not just the few.",
