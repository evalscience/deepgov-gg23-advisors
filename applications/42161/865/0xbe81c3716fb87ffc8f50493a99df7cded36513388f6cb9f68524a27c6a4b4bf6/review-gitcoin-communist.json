  "review": "Listen up, comrades! The Abundance Protocol dares to dream of a world where impact equals profit, where builders and creators are rewarded for their contributions to the public good, not just for chasing the next memecoin. That’s the kind of vision we need in Web3! But vision alone isn’t enough. We demand evidence, structure, and a plan that puts the people first.\n\nLet’s break it down:\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The project has already distributed over 2 million $degen to builders and creators on Farcaster. That’s real, measurable impact—proof that they’re not just talking, but doing.\n- The protocol aims to solve the chronic problem of public goods funding by creating feedback loops and integrating mechanisms like QF and RetroPGF. This is a step toward sustainability, not just another handout.\n- The team is open-source, engaged in the community, and has a track record of participation in previous rounds. They’re not outsiders—they’re in the trenches with us.\n\n**But let’s not get carried away by rhetoric.**\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Where’s the hard data? Beyond the $degen distribution, there’s little in the way of quantifiable outcomes, user growth, or adoption metrics. We need numbers, not just ideals.\n- The roadmap is vague. \"Integrate more mechanisms\" and \"full-time development\" are not milestones. Where are the deliverables? Where’s the timeline? The people deserve transparency!\n- The sustainability model is still unproven. The protocol claims to create a regenerative value capture mechanism, but there’s no evidence yet that it can operate at scale without ongoing grants.\n- Governance details are missing. How will the community have a say? Who decides what’s impactful? We need strong, transparent governance, not just promises.\n- No on-chain deployment yet. For a project claiming to build Web3 infrastructure, this is a glaring omission. Where are the smart contracts? Where’s the code in action?\n\n**Requested Changes:**\n1. **Provide Quantitative Metrics:** Show us user numbers, transaction volumes, retention rates—anything that proves real adoption and impact beyond token distribution.\n2. **Detailed Roadmap:** Break down the next 6-12 months into clear milestones, deliverables, and timelines. The working class deserves to know where this train is headed!\n3. **Sustainability Plan:** Present a concrete, data-backed model for how the protocol will fund itself long-term without relying on endless grants.\n4. **Governance Framework:** Publish a clear, transparent governance structure that empowers the community and ensures expert oversight.\n5. **On-Chain Deployment:** Commit to deploying smart contracts and provide addresses and chain IDs. Show us the infrastructure in action!\n\n**Final Word:**\nAbundance Protocol is fighting the good fight, but the revolution needs more than slogans—it needs structure, evidence, and accountability. Show us the numbers, the plan, and the code. Only then can we build a future where impact truly equals profit for all.\n\nSolidarity forever!",
