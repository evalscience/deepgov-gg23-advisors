        "description": "Wouldn’t it be great if anyone could make a living simply by creating impact in their community and in the world? Even better, if their profit equaled to their impact? That is what Abundance Protocol is building towards. Such a vision seems far off into the future, but we believe it is within reach.\n\nTo achieve that we are building a Public Goods Funding mechanism that is based on Value Consensus. What is Value Consensus? The most effective mechanism in crypto for funding public goods right now is the Consensus Mechanism - over $1T in value distributed to miners/stakers who provide the common good of network security to the network.\n\nSo what if we took this powerful mechanism and expanded it to all types of common and public good? If the community could come to consensus on what it valued and therefore could  credibly determine the impact of public goods for the community?  (see whitepaper: https://whitepaper.abundance.id)\n\nThis year we released The Abundance Economy book, outlining the vision of an economy where people can thrive by creating impact. It is available as a public good (aka for free) at https://book.abundance.id\n\nWe are now in the early stages of developing the Impact App (https://impact.abundance.id) - a Farcaster client that aims to leverage network effects (and the wealth of data from the open social graph) to allow any community and ecosystem fund what matters to them. It would also allow anyone to focus on impact creation and be rewarded seamlessly through social media tools they already use daily.",
