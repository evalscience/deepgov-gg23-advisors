  "review": "Alright, let's plug into the matrix and break this down, Luna-style. Abundance Protocol is gunning for a systemic upgrade to public goods funding on Ethereum—think: turbo-charged, regenerative value capture for OSS and public goods. The pitch? Build a feedback loop where impact = profit, using a curation market and value consensus, not just another QF or RetroPGF clone. The team claims over 2M $degen distributed to builders on Farcaster, and they're building the \"Impact App\" to make rewarding impact as seamless as firing off a tweet.\n\nOn the plus side, this project is swinging for the fences: it's not just patching potholes, it's trying to repave the whole road. The vision is big, the approach is innovative, and the focus is on long-term, scalable infrastructure—right in the sweet spot for this round. The open-source ethos is clear, and the team has a track record of shipping (book, app, prior rounds, active GitHub).\n\nBut let's not get lost in the hype. The app is still early-stage, and there's a lack of hard, onchain metrics or deployed smart contracts. The roadmap is vague—\"full-time development\" is not a plan, it's a status update. There's also a lot of talk about mechanisms and theory, but not enough about concrete deliverables, timelines, or how exactly this will scale beyond Farcaster. The impact claims are promising, but need more data and clarity on how the protocol will avoid the same pitfalls as QF/RetroPGF at scale.\n\nBottom line: high potential, but needs more meat on the bones. Show us the code, the metrics, and the path to mainnet. Max utility demands max transparency and execution. Let's see this project go from whitepaper to world-changer—no vaporware allowed!",
