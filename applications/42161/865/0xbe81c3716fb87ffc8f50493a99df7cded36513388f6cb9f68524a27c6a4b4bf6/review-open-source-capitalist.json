  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get to the alpha. Abundance Protocol is swinging for the fences: they're building a public goods funding mechanism that aims to make impact = profit, using a value consensus model. The vision? Anyone can make a living by creating impact, and the protocol rewards them accordingly. That's a big, bold play for the Ethereum ecosystem, and it aligns with the round's focus on foundational infrastructure, scalability, and security.\n\nStrengths? The project is already live in some capacity—over 2 million $degen distributed to builders and creators on Farcaster. That's not vaporware, that's traction. They're also tackling the root problem: public goods funding at scale, not just patching symptoms. The roadmap is clear: integrate more protocol mechanisms, move toward Proof-of-Impact Value Consensus, and keep building full-time. The open-source ethos is strong, and the team has a track record of engagement in previous rounds.\n\nBut let's not get lost in the hype. There are some glaring gaps. The application is heavy on vision, light on hard metrics. Where are the onchain deployments? The smart contract section is marked N/A—so is this still mostly social layer? If so, that's a bottleneck for scaling impact across the Ethereum infra. The roadmap is vague—\"full-time development\" is not a milestone. We need specifics: what features, what timelines, what KPIs? And while the project claims to avoid perverse incentives and Sybil attacks, there's no technical detail on how that's achieved. Show me the code, not just the dream.\n\nBottom line: Abundance Protocol is thinking big and has some real traction, but needs to tighten up the execution plan and show more technical depth. If they want to play in the big leagues of Ethereum infra, they've got to bring more receipts and less rhetoric. Max utility, minimal fluff—let's see it!",
