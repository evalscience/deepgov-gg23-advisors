  "summary": "The WYT Network project aims to simplify DeFi interactions by using AI to execute transactions based on natural language inputs. It addresses the complexity of DeFi for average users and enhances interoperability across multiple blockchain networks. The project plans to open-source its technology, contributing to the decentralization and security of the Ethereum network. However, the project is still in its development phase, with no deployed smart contracts yet.",
  "review": "The WYT Network project presents a compelling vision to simplify DeFi interactions through AI-driven natural language processing. This approach addresses significant barriers to DeFi adoption, such as complexity and fragmentation across multiple blockchain networks. By abstracting on-chain complexities and enabling multi-chain transactions with a single input, the project has the potential to enhance user experience and interoperability within the Ethereum ecosystem. The commitment to open-source their technology aligns with the principles of decentralization and community participation, contributing to the broader Ethereum infrastructure. However, the project is still in its early stages, with no smart contracts deployed, which raises concerns about its current impact and readiness. Additionally, while the project outlines a clear focus on development and engineering, more detailed metrics and examples of its contributions to the Ethereum network would strengthen its case for funding.",
