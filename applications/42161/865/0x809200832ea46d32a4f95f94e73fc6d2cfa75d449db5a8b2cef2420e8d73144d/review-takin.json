  "summary": "The WYT Network project aims to simplify DeFi interactions using AI and natural language, potentially broadening user adoption. While this aligns with enhancing user experience and digital inclusion, its direct contribution to Ethereum's *foundational infrastructure* is unclear, as research indicates it operates independently. Significant concerns arise regarding data sovereignty and ethical AI use due to its reliance on proprietary LLMs for sensitive financial transactions, which conflicts with Principle 3 (data sovereignty) and Principle 14 (citizen privacy and ethical AI). The absence of deployed contracts also indicates a very early stage for an infrastructure grant. The application lacks explicit alignment with broader Gross National Happiness principles, particularly regarding community engagement, environmental sustainability, and transparent governance beyond technical functionality.",
  "review": "The WYT Network project proposes an AI-driven platform to simplify DeFi interactions through natural language, aiming to enhance user experience and drive adoption across multiple chains. This vision of abstracting complexities and enabling multi-chain transactions via a single input is commendable for improving user accessibility, which aligns with the spirit of broadening digital inclusion (Principle 6, 36). The stated intention to open-source their Web3 domain-specific LLMs could potentially contribute to building local technological capabilities and AI expertise (Principle 32).\n\nHowever, a strict evaluation reveals significant misalignments with the round's core focus and the constitutional principles. The round explicitly seeks projects contributing to Ethereum's *foundational infrastructure*, including core client development, staking, and security innovations. The research indicates that WYT Network \"operates independently and is not directly part of the Ethereum ecosystem,\" suggesting it functions more as an application layer built *on top of* Ethereum rather than contributing to its underlying infrastructure. This is a critical distinction.\n\nFurthermore, the reliance on \"proprietary LLMs and solver networks\" for executing financial transactions, even with the promise of open-sourcing, introduces concerns regarding centralization and trust. The processing of natural language inputs for sensitive financial operations raises substantial questions about data privacy and sovereignty (Principle 3, 14). The application lacks a detailed framework for how user data will be protected, how the AI's decision-making processes (e.g., \"best possible execution path\") are transparent and auditable, and how potential biases in the LLMs are mitigated. This directly impacts ethical AI use and transparent governance (Principle 13, 14).\n\nThe statement \"Contracts have not been deployed\" is a significant red flag for a project seeking grants for infrastructure development in the DeFi space. This indicates a very early stage of development with no tangible on-chain presence, making it difficult to assess its security claims or operational viability.\n\nFrom a Gross National Happiness perspective, while simplifying DeFi could indirectly contribute to economic well-being, the application does not explicitly address broader GNH principles such as environmental sustainability, cultural preservation, or direct community engagement beyond general user adoption (Principles 4, 5, 17-20, 39, 40). The focus appears to be primarily on technological advancement and financial accessibility, without a clear articulation of how it contributes to collective well-being or fosters local ownership and participation.",
