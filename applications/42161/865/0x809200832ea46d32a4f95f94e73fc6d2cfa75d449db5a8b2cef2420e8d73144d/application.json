Users simply need to give a command, for e.g. \"Swap 500 USDC to SOL\" through our chat-bot like interface and our AI will automatically execute the transaction for them via the best possible execution path to optimise for gas costs & minimising slippage.\nThe current complexities of interacting on-chain including wallet creation, navigating to different dApps, verifying transactions and multi step executions has made DeFi inaccessible for most users, limiting adoption. Our platform makes DeFi 10X easier to use while abstracting away all complexities traditionally associated with the blockchain. We believe that this will significantly drive DeFi adoption and activity throughout the Ethereum ecosystem.\n",

For example, even a simple swap transaction can require multiple steps & approvals\nOur solution drastically simplifies DeFi interactions and our AI automatically executes these transactions automatically, eliminating complexity. Users simply give us a single command through natural language inputs without worrying about the steps needed to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n2.\tEver-growing number of L1s & L2s : Today’s DeFi spans multiple Layer-1 and Layer-2 networks. Each has its own bridging solutions, tokens, and user interfaces, This has led to fragmentation of the Ethereum ecosystem as navigating between various chains is tedious & challenging and time consuming.\nOur solution enables multi-chain transactions with a single input. For example a users can say \"Swap 500 USDC on Ethereum to 500 USDT on Arbitrum\". The user does not need to worry about which bridge to use, which DEX's to use or even gas fees improving interoperability between chains. They simply see a single unified and consolidated dashboard and the AI handles cross-chain interactions behind the scenes.\n",
