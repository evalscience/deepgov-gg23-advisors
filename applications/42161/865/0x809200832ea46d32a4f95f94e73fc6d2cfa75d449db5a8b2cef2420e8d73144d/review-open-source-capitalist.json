  "summary": "The WYT Network project aims to simplify DeFi interactions by using AI to execute transactions based on natural language inputs. This approach addresses the complexity of DeFi for average users and enhances interoperability across multiple blockchain networks. The project plans to open-source its technology, contributing to the decentralization and security of the Ethereum network. However, the project is still in its development phase, with no smart contracts deployed yet.",
  "review": "The WYT Network project presents a compelling solution to the complexity of DeFi interactions by leveraging AI to facilitate transactions through natural language commands. This innovation could significantly enhance user experience and drive broader adoption of DeFi, aligning with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure. The project's commitment to open-sourcing its technology is commendable, as it supports decentralization and security within the Ethereum ecosystem. However, the lack of deployed smart contracts and specific metrics to demonstrate current impact or progress is a notable weakness. The project should provide more concrete evidence of its development progress and potential impact to strengthen its application.",
