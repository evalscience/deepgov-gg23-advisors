  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get to the core. WYT Network is gunning to be the DeFi Swiss Army knife—intent-based, AI-powered, and aiming to abstract away all the gnarly on-chain complexity that keeps normies out of the game. The pitch: natural language commands for DeFi, cross-chain swaps, and a unified dashboard. If it works, it could be a serious on-ramp for mass adoption and a big win for Ethereum’s usability layer.\n\nStrengths? The project is swinging for the fences on user experience, leveraging proprietary LLMs trained on crypto data, and promising open-source infra. That’s a triple threat for impact, scale, and composability. The focus on security—AI contract verification before execution—directly addresses a root cause of DeFi hacks and rug pulls. Plus, the multi-chain intent abstraction is a legit innovation, potentially reducing fragmentation and onboarding friction across L1s and L2s.\n\nBut let’s not get lost in the hype. Weaknesses are glaring: there’s a lack of concrete metrics, no deployed contracts, and the roadmap is vaporware-level vague. The application is heavy on vision, light on execution details. There’s no evidence of traction, user numbers, or even a working MVP in the wild. The open-source claim is strong, but there’s no clarity on licensing, governance, or how external devs will actually plug in. And while the AI angle is spicy, there’s zero detail on model transparency, safety, or how they’ll handle adversarial prompts and edge cases—critical for infra that touches user funds.\n\nRequested changes: Show me the code, not just the dream. I want to see a public repo with actual commits, a clear open-source license, and a technical roadmap with milestones and deliverables. Drop some usage stats or at least a working demo with real users. Spell out your AI safety and contract verification approach—don’t just hand-wave it. And if you’re serious about decentralization, outline how you’ll avoid central points of failure in your infra. Max utility means max transparency and execution, not just max hype.\n\nBottom line: WYT Network has high-impact potential if it delivers, but right now it’s all sizzle, no steak. Tighten up the execution plan, show real progress, and you’ll be a contender. Until then, it’s a high-risk, high-reward bet.",
