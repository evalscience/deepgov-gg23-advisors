  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. WYT Network is gunning to be the DeFi Swiss Army knife—intent-based, AI-powered, and aiming to abstract away all the gnarly on-chain complexity that keeps normies out of the game. The pitch? Users bark a command in plain English, and the platform’s AI does the heavy lifting: swaps, staking, cross-chain moves, you name it. The team claims their proprietary LLMs are trained on crypto-specific data, and they’re building solver networks to decode and execute user intent efficiently. \n\nOn the impact front, this is a big swing at a root cause: DeFi’s UX is a dumpster fire for the average user. If WYT can deliver, it’s a massive unlock for Ethereum’s adoption curve—think onboarding millions, not thousands. The cross-chain angle is spicy too, promising to stitch together fragmented L1s and L2s into a seamless user experience. That’s a direct hit on the interoperability pain point, which is a systemic bottleneck for the whole ecosystem.\n\nSecurity gets a nod: the AI claims to verify contract authenticity before execution, which, if robust, could be a game-changer for user safety. The open-source commitment is there, at least in the application, but details are thin. The roadmap is vague—\"development & engineering costs\" is boilerplate, not a plan. No deployed contracts yet, so we’re in pre-product territory. There’s a GitHub, but no direct evidence of traction, usage metrics, or community engagement. \n\nBottom line: WYT is swinging for max utility and long-term systemic change, but the lack of concrete deliverables, metrics, and transparency on open-source implementation is a red flag. High potential, but needs more receipts before we ape in with serious capital. \n\nCitations: Application answers to questions 5, 6, 7, 9; GitHub link provided; no deployed contracts (question 10).",
