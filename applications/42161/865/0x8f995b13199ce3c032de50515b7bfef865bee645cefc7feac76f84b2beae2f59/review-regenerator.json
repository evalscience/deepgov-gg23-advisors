  "summary": "The Peersky Browser project aims to enhance the Ethereum ecosystem by providing a peer-to-peer web browser that supports native resolution of .eth domains without relying on centralized HTTP gateways. It introduces innovative features such as a web3:// protocol handler, enabling users to access decentralized content directly from smart contracts. The project addresses significant challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as the reliance on centralized gateways for accessing .eth domains and the complexity of Web3 publishing. The grant funding will be used to further develop the browser, improve performance, and explore new features like offline-capable Web3 resolution and blockchain-based SSL certificate verification.",
  "review": "The Peersky Browser project presents a compelling case for enhancing the Ethereum ecosystem's infrastructure by eliminating the need for centralized HTTP gateways and supporting native ENS resolution. The application highlights the project's innovative approach to improving user experience and privacy by enabling direct access to decentralized content. The project's roadmap is ambitious, focusing on reducing RPC reliance and enhancing security through blockchain-based SSL verification. However, the application lacks specific metrics or examples of current user adoption and engagement, which are crucial for assessing the project's impact. Additionally, while the project addresses significant challenges, the application could benefit from a more detailed explanation of how it plans to achieve its future goals, particularly in terms of technical feasibility and resource allocation.",
