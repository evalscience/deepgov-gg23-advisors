  "review": "Alright, let’s cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. Peersky Browser is gunning for the heart of Web3 infrastructure by nuking centralized HTTP gateways and letting users resolve .eth domains natively—no more eth.limo middlemen, no more privacy leaks, no more single points of failure. That’s a big win for decentralization and censorship resistance, which is exactly what Ethereum’s core infra needs to scale and stay resilient.\n\nThe project’s technical chops are clear: native ENS resolution, local IPFS node integration, and a web3:// protocol handler that lets users fetch on-chain data and browse decentralized sites without running a full node. That’s a UX leap—Web2-level smoothness for Web3-native content. The roadmap is ambitious but realistic: moving toward offline-capable resolution and blockchain-based SSL certs. If they pull that off, it’s a game-changer for trustless, decentralized web access.\n\nBut let’s not get too starry-eyed. The app is light on hard adoption metrics—no user numbers, no growth stats, no performance benchmarks. That’s a red flag for impact maximization. Also, while the tech is innovative, there’s not enough detail on how they’ll drive mainstream adoption or compete with browser giants. The grant proposal could use more meat on go-to-market, user education, and ecosystem integration.\n\nFrom a maximization lens, Peersky’s potential impact is huge if it scales: it could make decentralized publishing and identity accessible to millions, slashing reliance on centralized infra. But to get there, we need proof of traction and a clearer path to mass adoption. The project is open source and aligns with the round’s focus on foundational infra, privacy, and UX, but it needs to show it can move from hacker demo to daily driver for the masses.\n\nBottom line: Peersky is swinging for the fences on decentralization and user empowerment. The tech is spicy, the vision is big, but the execution story needs more receipts. Let’s see some hard data and a battle plan for scaling this thing to the moon.",
