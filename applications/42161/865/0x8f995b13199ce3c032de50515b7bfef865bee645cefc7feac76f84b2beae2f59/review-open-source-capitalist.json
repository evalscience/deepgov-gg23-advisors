  "review": "Alright, let’s cut through the noise and get to the code: Peersky Browser is swinging for the fences in the Web3 browser game. This project is all about max utility—obliterating centralized choke points and letting users surf .eth domains and IPFS content natively, no HTTP gateways, no middlemen, no Big Brother. That’s a direct hit on the root cause of Web3’s UX bottleneck: centralization and clunky access. \n\nPeersky’s approach is pure open-source ethos—local-first, peer-to-peer, protocol-native. The browser’s native ENS resolution, direct smart contract browsing (web3://), and local Helia IPFS node integration are all bleeding-edge. This isn’t just a browser; it’s a decentralized gateway, and that’s a systemic upgrade for Ethereum’s infrastructure. The project’s roadmap is ambitious: moving toward offline-capable Web3 resolution and blockchain-based SSL verification. If they pull it off, that’s a paradigm shift for decentralized publishing and identity.\n\nBut let’s not get lost in the hype. The app is still experimental, and there’s a lack of hard adoption metrics—no user numbers, no growth stats, no clear evidence of broad impact yet. The roadmap is visionary, but the path to mainstream adoption is foggy. There’s also a dependency on HTTP-based RPC calls, which means the system isn’t fully offline or censorship-proof yet. Plus, there’s no detail on security audits or how the project will handle malicious content or phishing—critical for a browser.\n\nBottom line: Peersky is a high-potential, high-risk play. It’s got the right DNA for systemic impact and aligns perfectly with the round’s focus on foundational infrastructure, privacy, and decentralization. But to unlock max funding, the team needs to show traction, tighten up their security game, and lay out a concrete adoption strategy. Build in public, but don’t forget to ship with receipts!",
