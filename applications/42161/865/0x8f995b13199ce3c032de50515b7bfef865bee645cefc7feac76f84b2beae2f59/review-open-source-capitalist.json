  "summary": "Peersky Browser is a bold, local-first, peer-to-peer browser aiming to nuke centralized choke points in Ethereum’s web infrastructure. It’s gunning for max decentralization, privacy, and censorship-resistance by letting users resolve .eth domains and access IPFS content natively—no HTTP gateways, no middlemen. The project’s got serious potential for systemic impact, but it’s still early, with limited adoption and some technical dependencies that could bottleneck scale. Efficiency is solid, but the path to mass market is unproven. No major ethical red flags, but claims need more external validation.",
  "review": "## 1. Efficiency & Scale: The Big Picture\nPeersky’s vision is pure Web3 maximalism: kill the middleman, empower the edge, and let users surf the decentralized web without centralized gateways. That’s a huge win for systemic resilience and censorship-resistance—if it scales. By resolving ENS and IPFS content locally, Peersky slashes reliance on HTTP gateways (like eth.limo), which are single points of failure and privacy nightmares. This is a direct hit on the root causes of centralization in Ethereum’s web layer.\n\n### Quantitative Impact Assessment\n- **Potential User Base:** Every Ethereum user who wants to access .eth domains or decentralized content—potentially millions, but actual adoption is currently unknown.\n- **Utility Maximization:** Eliminates centralized bottlenecks, improves privacy, and could set a new standard for decentralized UX. If adopted at scale, the impact is transformative.\n- **Efficiency:** Local resolution and caching reduce RPC calls and network load, optimizing resource use. However, the browser still relies on HTTP-based RPC for ENS lookups, so it’s not fully offline or trustless yet.\n- **Cost-Benefit:** High upside if adoption grows, but current market penetration is unclear. Development costs are justified if the project can cross the chasm to mainstream use.\n\n## 2. Innovation & Market Fit\n- **Pioneering Features:** Native ENS/IPFS resolution, web3:// protocol handler, and local Helia node integration are bleeding-edge. No other browser offers this combo natively.\n- **User Experience:** Promises Web2-like usability for Web3 content, which is a massive barrier-breaker. But UX polish and onboarding for non-technical users are still question marks.\n- **Interoperability:** Supports multiple protocols (ipfs://, ipns://, hyper://, web3://), which is a plus for future-proofing.\n\n## 3. Weaknesses & Bottlenecks\n- **Adoption Risk:** No evidence of significant user traction or ecosystem integration yet. Without users, even the best infra is just code in a repo.\n- **Technical Dependencies:** Still relies on HTTP-based RPC for ENS lookups—so not fully decentralized or offline-capable. This is a critical bottleneck for the “max decentralization” narrative.\n- **Validation:** Claims are strong, but there’s little external validation or third-party review. No academic or industry citations, and the project is too new for robust market feedback.\n- **Sustainability:** No clear business model or path to long-term maintenance if grant funding dries up.\n\n## 4. Systemic Impact & Alignment\n- **Long-Term Leverage:** If Peersky becomes the go-to gateway for decentralized content, it could fundamentally shift how users interact with Ethereum and Web3. That’s a root-cause, systemic play.\n- **Scalability:** The architecture is designed for scale, but real-world stress tests and adoption are missing.\n- **Efficiency:** Minimal overhead, no complex governance, and open-source ethos are all in line with max utility principles.\n\n## 5. Ethical/Legal Review\n- No evidence of scams, harmful impact, or legal/ethical violations. The project is open-source and privacy-focused.\n- Some claims are ambitious and not yet externally verified, but not outright misleading.\n\n## 6. Final Assessment\nPeersky is a high-upside, high-risk bet. If it delivers on its promises and gains traction, it could be a market leader in decentralized web infrastructure. But it needs more proof points, user adoption, and technical hardening to hit the top tier. For now, it’s a strong investment with room for optimization.\n\n**Expected Impact Formula:**\n\\[\n\\text{Expected Impact} = \\text{Potential User Base} \\times \\text{Utility Gain per User} \\times \\text{Adoption Probability}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in rough estimates:\n- Potential User Base: 1,000,000 (ETH power users, devs, privacy advocates)\n- Utility Gain: High (privacy, censorship-resistance, UX)\n- Adoption Probability: Low-to-moderate (early stage, unproven market)\n\nNet: High variance, but non-trivial expected value if even a fraction of the market adopts.\n\n---\n**TL;DR:** Peersky is swinging for the fences. If it connects, it’s a home run for Ethereum infra. But it’s still in the early innings—needs more users, more validation, and a path to full decentralization.",
