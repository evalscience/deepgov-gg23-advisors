  "summary": "The Peersky Browser project aims to revolutionize the way users interact with the decentralized web by eliminating the need for centralized HTTP gateways. It introduces a peer-to-peer browser that supports native resolution of .eth domains and direct access to decentralized content via protocols like IPFS and ENS. The project aligns with the round's focus on enhancing Ethereum's infrastructure by providing a censorship-resistant, decentralized browsing experience. However, the application lacks detailed metrics and a clear plan for achieving full offline functionality, which are critical for assessing its potential impact and scalability.",
  "review": "The Peersky Browser project presents a compelling vision for decentralizing web access by removing reliance on centralized HTTP gateways. It supports native ENS resolution and direct access to decentralized content, which aligns well with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure. The project demonstrates innovation in enhancing privacy and user experience by enabling gatewayless browsing and supporting multiple decentralized protocols. However, the application lacks specific metrics to quantify its impact and a detailed roadmap for achieving full offline functionality, which are essential for evaluating its scalability and long-term viability. Additionally, while the project addresses significant challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem, it needs to provide more concrete examples of its current adoption and user base to better assess its contribution to the network.",
