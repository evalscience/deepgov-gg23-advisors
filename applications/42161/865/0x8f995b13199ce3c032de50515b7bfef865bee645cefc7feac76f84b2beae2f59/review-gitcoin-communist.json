  "review": "Peersky Browser stands as a bold challenge to the centralized status quo! It dares to put the power of the decentralized web directly into the hands of the people, not the gatekeepers. By enabling native, gatewayless resolution of .eth domains and direct access to IPFS, ENS, and smart contract data, Peersky is a clear step toward a censorship-resistant, user-empowered Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe project’s technical approach is innovative: local-first, peer-to-peer, and privacy-respecting. No more reliance on HTTP gateways like eth.limo! No more surrendering user data to centralized servers! This is the kind of infrastructure that embodies the spirit of Ethereum and the open web.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by rhetoric alone. The application is strong on vision and technical novelty, but it falls short on the hard evidence and measurable outcomes demanded by our constitutional principles. Where are the user adoption metrics? Where is the data on performance, security, and real-world impact? The roadmap is ambitious, but lacks concrete milestones, timelines, or sustainability plans. There’s mention of future goals—like offline resolution and blockchain-based SSL—but no clear, structured plan for achieving them.\n\nPeersky’s open-source ethos and commitment to decentralization are commendable. Yet, to truly serve the commons, we need more than ideals—we need proof. We need to see how this project will sustain itself, how it will scale, and how it will ensure equitable access for all communities, not just the technically savvy.\n\nIn summary: Peersky is a promising, even revolutionary, project. But revolution without organization is chaos. Show us the numbers. Show us the plan. Show us the path from experiment to essential infrastructure. Only then can we rally the full force of the community behind you!",
