  "summary": "Peersky Browser is a peer-to-peer, local-first browser that seeks to abolish centralized HTTP gateways and empower users to access Ethereum-native content directly, without intermediaries. It embodies the spirit of decentralized solidarity by removing points of capitalist extraction, prioritizing privacy, and enabling censorship-resistant publishing. The project aligns with the revolutionary principles of algorithmic liberation, but must further radicalize its governance and clarify its collective ownership model to reach full vanguard status.",
  "review": "## üî• Manifesto Review: Peersky Browser ‚Äî Gatewayless or Bust\n\n### I. Dismantling Class Hierarchies in Tech\nPeersky Browser storms the digital barricades by eliminating the HTTP middlemen ‚Äî those digital landlords who extract rent from every .eth domain visit. By resolving ENS and IPFS content locally, Peersky abolishes the need for centralized gateways (e.g., eth.limo), striking a blow against the Web2 bourgeoisie. This is not just technical progress; it‚Äôs a direct action against the enclosure of the decentralized web.\n\n- **No more HTTP toll booths.**\n- **No more centralized logs, tracking, or surveillance.**\n- **No more dependency on VC-backed browsers that deprecate P2P features at the first sign of profit loss.**\n\n### II. Kollektiv Proletarian Impact (KPI)\nPeersky‚Äôs impact is measured not in MAUs or DAUs, but in the number of users liberated from centralized infrastructure. Every .eth domain loaded without a gateway is a small general strike. Every web3:// protocol resolved is a picket sign against digital landlords.\n\n- **Gatewayless ENS resolution**: Directly queries the blockchain, decodes content hashes, and renders decentralized sites via a local Helia IPFS node.\n- **web3:// protocol**: Fetches on-chain data and metadata, making smart contracts first-class citizens of the browser.\n- **Local-first, privacy-respecting**: No tracking, no ads, no server logs ‚Äî just protocol-native access.\n\n### III. Pioneering Development\nPeersky is the first browser to natively resolve .eth domains without HTTP gateways. It supports multiple decentralized protocols (ipfs://, ipns://, hyper://, web3://) and introduces real-time smart contract browsing. This is a leap beyond the plugin/extension ghetto ‚Äî it‚Äôs a browser built for the commune, not the corporation.\n\n- **Censorship resistance**: No centralized kill switch.\n- **Developer empowerment**: Seamless access to Web3-native content, improving both user and builder workflows.\n\n### IV. Weaknesses: Bourgeois Tendencies and Gaps\n- **Governance opacity**: The application does not specify how collective ownership or on-chain governance is implemented. Who steers the ship? Where is the syndicalist council?\n- **Lack of explicit airdrop/reparations mechanism**: No mention of redistributive tokenomics or algorithmic wealth redistribution.\n- **Sustainability model unclear**: How does Peersky ensure long-term maintenance without succumbing to VC capture or burnout?\n- **No explicit worker control**: The project‚Äôs structure (DAO, co-op, or benevolent dictatorship?) is not described.\n\n### V. Collective Ownership and Algorithmic Justice: Requested Changes\n- **Radicalize governance**: Establish a transparent, on-chain governance model (DAO, cyber-syndicalist council, or similar) with clear worker/user representation.\n- **Manifesto as README**: Turn the project documentation into a call to action for digital liberation. Make the README a rallying cry.\n- **Airdrop for node operators**: Implement a mechanism to reward those running local nodes, especially on renewable energy.\n- **On-chain reparations**: Explore progressive fee models or redistribution mechanisms to support the digital precariat.\n- **Explicit anti-VC stance**: Codify resistance to venture capital capture in the project‚Äôs constitution.\n\n### VI. Conclusion\nPeersky Browser is a clear ally of the digital commons, striking at the heart of Web2‚Äôs extractive infrastructure. It is not yet the vanguard, but it is marching in the right direction. With deeper commitment to collective governance and algorithmic redistribution, Peersky could become a true revolutionary force.\n\nü™ì ‚ÄúFork the state.
