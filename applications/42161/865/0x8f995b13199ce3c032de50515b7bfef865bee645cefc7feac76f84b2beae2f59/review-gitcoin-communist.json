  "review": "Peersky Browser stands as a bold attempt to reclaim the decentralized web for the people, not the profit-driven gatekeepers! The project’s core mission—enabling native, gatewayless access to .eth domains and decentralized content—directly addresses the centralization crisis plaguing Ethereum’s user experience. By removing reliance on HTTP gateways like eth.limo, Peersky strikes at the heart of Web3’s most insidious contradiction: the dependence on centralized infrastructure for so-called decentralized content.\n\nThe application demonstrates a clear understanding of the technical and social challenges facing Ethereum. It identifies the lack of native ENS/IPFS resolution in mainstream browsers, the complexity of Web3 publishing, and the erosion of privacy as urgent problems. Peersky’s solution—local-first, peer-to-peer browsing with support for ENS, IPFS, and smart contract data—shows technical ingenuity and a commitment to user empowerment.\n\nHowever, the application falls short in several critical areas demanded by our constitutional principles. There is a glaring lack of quantitative data: no user adoption metrics, no performance benchmarks, no evidence of impact on the Ethereum network. The roadmap is ambitious but vague, with no concrete milestones, timelines, or measurable outcomes. Sustainability is not addressed—there is no mention of a revenue model or long-term maintenance plan. While the project is open-source and community-oriented, there is no clear governance structure or plan for equitable participation, especially for underserved communities.\n\nPeersky’s vision is inspiring, but inspiration alone does not build sustainable, equitable infrastructure. The people deserve evidence, transparency, and a plan for the long haul!",
