  "summary": "The Peersky Browser project aims to enhance the Ethereum ecosystem by providing a peer-to-peer web browser that supports native resolution of .eth domains without relying on centralized HTTP gateways. It introduces a web3:// protocol handler, allowing users to access decentralized content directly from smart contracts and IPFS nodes. The project addresses significant challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as the reliance on centralized gateways and the complexity of Web3 publishing. The grant funding will be used to further develop the browser, improve performance, and explore new features like offline-capable Web3 resolution and blockchain-based SSL certificate verification.",
  "review": "The Peersky Browser project presents a compelling case for enhancing the Ethereum ecosystem's infrastructure by eliminating the need for centralized HTTP gateways and enabling native resolution of .eth domains. The project demonstrates significant contributions to decentralization and privacy by resolving ENS, IPFS, and Web3 data locally via peer-to-peer protocols. The introduction of the web3:// protocol handler is a pioneering development that enhances user experience by allowing direct access to on-chain data and decentralized websites. However, the project lacks detailed metrics and evidence of measurable outcomes, which is crucial for evaluating its impact. Additionally, the roadmap could benefit from more specific milestones and timelines to ensure accountability and transparency in achieving development goals.",
