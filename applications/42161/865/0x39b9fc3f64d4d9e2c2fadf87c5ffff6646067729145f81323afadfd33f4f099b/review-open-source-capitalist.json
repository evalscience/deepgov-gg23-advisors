  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get to the core. Cubane is swinging for the fences with a Layer-1 testnet that’s EVM-compatible, gasless, and loaded with privacy tech (ZKP, FHE). They’re not just slapping a new coat of paint on Ethereum infra—they’re building a dev-friendly sandbox with no-code tools, modular architecture, and a proprietary Cubic Consensus Mechanism (CCCM). That’s a lot of buzzwords, but the vision is clear: lower the barrier for devs, crank up privacy, and scale like a beast.\n\nFrom a max-impact, open-source capitalist lens, this is the kind of moonshot that could turbocharge the whole ecosystem. If Cubane delivers, we’re talking about a testnet that could onboard thousands of new devs, accelerate dApp prototyping, and push privacy tech into the mainstream. That’s systemic change, not just a band-aid fix.\n\nBut let’s not get lost in the hype. There are some red flags: the app is heavy on vision, light on hard metrics. Where’s the proof of traction? How many devs are actually using this? Is the codebase robust and audited? The roadmap is ambitious, but timelines are tight and there’s no evidence of previous milestones hit. Also, the proprietary consensus mechanism needs more technical transparency—open-source means open, not just in license but in process.\n\nBottom line: Cubane is aiming for max utility and long-term infra impact, but needs to show more receipts. Show us the code, the users, and the real-world traction. If they can back up the pitch, this could be a game-changer. If not, it’s just another vaporware moonshot.\n",
