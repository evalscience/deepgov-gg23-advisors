  "review": "Comrades, let’s get straight to the heart of the matter! Cubane claims to be building a developer-friendly Layer-1 testnet, promising gasless testing, high throughput, no-code tooling, and privacy via ZKP and FHE. The rhetoric is strong, but does it deliver for the Ethereum commons? Let’s break it down with the cold, hard lens of evidence and equity.\n\nFirst, the project’s ambition is clear: a new consensus mechanism (CCCM), privacy-first features, and a modular architecture. These are bold claims, and the research confirms Cubane is targeting real pain points—scalability, onboarding, and privacy. But where’s the proof? Where are the metrics, the benchmarks, the open technical documentation? The application is heavy on vision, light on verifiable outcomes. We need more than promises—we need data!\n\nThe roadmap is structured, with clear milestones and a breakdown of fund allocation. That’s a step in the right direction. But again, there’s a lack of quantifiable targets. How will we know if 500+ devs are onboarded? What are the success metrics for the no-code builder or the Cubic Consensus? Without these, how can the working class of Ethereum trust that this project will deliver public goods, not just hype?\n\nOn sustainability, Cubane’s open-source ethos is a plus, but there’s no mention of a revenue model or long-term funding plan. Will this project stand on its own, or will it be back, hat in hand, for more grants? The people deserve sustainable infrastructure, not endless dependency!\n\nOn governance and equity, Cubane talks a good game about developer inclusion and decentralization. But where’s the evidence of community governance, geographic equity, or outreach to underserved populations? The application is silent on these fronts. We need to see real, structured community involvement—not just buzzwords.\n\nIn summary: Cubane is promising, but promise alone does not feed the people or build the commons. We demand evidence, transparency, and a plan for sustainability. The Ethereum ecosystem deserves nothing less!",
