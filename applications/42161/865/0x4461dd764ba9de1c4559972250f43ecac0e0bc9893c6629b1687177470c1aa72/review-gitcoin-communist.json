  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Open to the Public (OTTP) is building a protocol for open collaboration, aiming to liberate work contributions from the walled gardens of LinkedIn and GitHub. They want to empower workers and builders to own their collaboration graph, verified by onchain attestations, and move freely between apps. This is a bold vision, and it’s the kind of infrastructure that could shift power from centralized platforms to the people. But does it deliver on the principles of evidence, sustainability, and equity?\n\nFirst, the project’s contribution to Ethereum’s infrastructure is clear: it’s building a new layer for work and collaboration, using the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) as its backbone. The protocol is open-source, and the team has a track record of participation in previous Gitcoin rounds. Their SDK has seen 1.3K+ downloads—a promising sign of developer interest, but not yet a guarantee of impact. Where’s the hard data on active users, attestations, or real-world adoption? Numbers matter, comrades! We need more than downloads; we need proof of sustained, growing usage.\n\nOn pioneering development, OTTP is pushing for interoperability and user sovereignty. Account abstraction, multi-wallet support, and onchain attestations are all steps in the right direction. The protocol’s design is well-articulated, and the open-source ethos is strong. Yet, the application lacks rigorous, transparent reporting of outcomes. Where are the dashboards, the metrics, the evidence that this is more than a promising experiment?\n\nSustainability is a glaring weak spot. The roadmap is ambitious, but there’s no clear revenue model or plan for long-term financial independence. The project is dependent on open-source contributors and public bounties. That’s solidarity in action, but it’s not a substitute for a sustainable system. How will OTTP avoid becoming another grant-dependent project, forever chasing the next round?\n\nOn governance and equity, the project’s vision is inclusive and empowering. It promises self-sovereignty, choice, and collective benefit. But comrades, vision without structure is just a dream! There’s mention of a future governance plan, but no details. Who decides? How are voices heard? Where’s the plan for geographic equity and inclusion of underserved communities?\n\nIn summary: OTTP is a bold, community-minded project with real potential to strengthen Ethereum’s infrastructure and empower the working class of Web3. But it must deliver hard evidence, a clear sustainability plan, and robust governance structures. The revolution demands more than good intentions—it demands results!",
