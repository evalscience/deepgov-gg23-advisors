  "summary": "The 'Open to the Public' project aims to create a decentralized work/contribution graph powered by onchain attestations, enhancing collaboration and verification of contributions across various platforms. It seeks to address the issue of siloed work contributions by providing a self-custodial, verifiable record of collaborations. The project is built on the Ethereum Attestation Service and aims to enhance interoperability and user experience through its open protocol and SDKs.",
  "review": "The 'Open to the Public' project presents a compelling vision for decentralizing work contributions and enhancing collaboration through onchain attestations. The project aligns well with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure, particularly in decentralized identity and interoperability. The use of Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) to verify contributions and collaborations is innovative and addresses the problem of siloed work contributions effectively. The project has demonstrated progress with its SDK v1, which has over 1.3K downloads, indicating community interest and engagement. However, the application lacks detailed metrics and evidence of measurable outcomes, which are crucial for evaluating its impact and sustainability. The roadmap is ambitious but lacks clarity on how the proposed features will be implemented and measured for success. Additionally, while the project emphasizes decentralization and user control, it does not provide a clear governance structure or sustainability model to ensure long-term viability. Overall, the project shows promise but requires more detailed planning and evidence of impact to align with the constitutional principles and values.",
