  "review": "Let’s cut through the noise: Open to the Public (OTTP) is swinging for the fences, aiming to break the chains of centralized work platforms and put power back in the hands of the people. The project’s vision is clear—decentralize the work graph, make collaboration verifiable, and let every contributor own their story. That’s the kind of ambition the Ethereum ecosystem needs. But ambition alone isn’t enough. We demand evidence, sustainability, and a plan that serves the many, not the few.\n\nOn the evidence front, OTTP shows some muscle: 1,300+ SDK downloads, a live protocol, and a roadmap with concrete milestones. The project’s open-source ethos and use of onchain attestations for verifiable contributions are strong steps toward building public goods. The team’s commitment to using 100% of funds for development, especially via public bounties, is a nod to collective ownership and transparency.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by rhetoric. Where’s the hard data on user retention, active usage, or real-world impact? Downloads are a start, but how many are building, how many are staying, and how many are benefiting? The application lacks rigorous outcome measurement and transparent reporting. There’s talk of a future Dune dashboard, but we need those metrics now—not promises.\n\nSustainability is another battleground. The project leans heavily on grants and public bounties, with only vague references to future governance and commercial models. Where’s the plan for long-term stability? How will OTTP avoid becoming just another grant-dependent experiment? The application needs a clear, evidence-backed path to sustainability.\n\nOn governance, OTTP talks a good game about community control and self-sovereignty, but the details are thin. How will governance be structured? How will equity and geographic inclusion be ensured? The project must show how it will empower the many, not just the loudest voices.\n\nIn summary: OTTP is a bold, necessary push for decentralized collaboration infrastructure. But to earn the people’s trust—and this grant—it must deliver more than vision. It must show evidence, sustainability, and a plan for collective benefit. The revolution demands nothing less!",
