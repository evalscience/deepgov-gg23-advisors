        "description": "# The protocol for open collaboration. Built on Base. Co-create, attest, and own your collaboration graph, forever.\n\nThink of it as a decentralized work/contribution graph that’s powered by onchain attestations. It’s the collaboration layer on top of EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service). Every connection and contribution is verified by your collaborators.\n\nApps built on the protocol will enable you to:\n- create projects\n- contribute and receive credit\n- remix/fork projects\n\n\n## Problem\n\nYour work contributions are siloed in various projects, self-reported and unverified, and locked into closed platforms like LinkedIn and GitHub.\n\n![Current State to Future State](https://i.imgur.com/ktAPsPf.png)\n\n## Solution\n\nYou own verified records of what you’ve done and who you collaborated with.\n\nContributions are recognized and provable, verified by collaborators via onchain attestations, and self-custodial, meaning your collaboration graph can move freely between apps/clients.\n\n\n## How It Works\n\nOTTP protocol design using onchain attestations:\n- **Subjects:** identities who take actions\n- **Objects:** containers created by subjects\n- **Blocks:** object subcomponents created by subjects\n- **Links:** verified connections between subjects and objects\n\n![OTTP subjects and objects](https://i.imgur.com/SS7f4jJ.png)\n\nAny subject (individual or team) can create an object. To start, there are four object types:\n- Project\n- Proposal\n- Milestone\n- Contribution\n\nBlocks are subcomponents that can point to onchain or off-chain data (files, images, links, etc.). Every link (connection) between subjects and/or objects can be verified by an onchain attestation.\n\n![OTTP subjects, objects, and blocks example](https://i.imgur.com/WZdGMiV.png)\n\nSee our [website](https://opentothepublic.org) and [docs](https://docs.opentothepublic.org) for more information about the protocol. View the [user flow here](https://www.figma.com/board/0OM3ythk8oWeehhLonKYc8/OTTP-user-flow?node-id=1-45&t=JNgFhLWZNrMEiMuW-1).\n\n\n\n## Web client\n\nTo demo the protocol, we’re developing an open-source web client built on OTTP. It will demonstrate how users can easily **find collaborators**, **contribute to projects**, and **put their work onchain**.\n\nExplore the [Figma prototype](https://bit.ly/ottp-web-client-v0-prototype) and view the work-in progress in our [Github repo](https://github.com/opentothepublic/ottp-web-client/tree/dev).\n\n![OTTP web client v0](https://i.imgur.com/lbtN3Vs.png)\n\n\nThe OTTP front-end will include the basic core features, with a less opinionated structure, which allows different builders to customize it and create clients focused around certain communities or audience segments (DAOs, fractional workers, etc.).\n\nWe are raising funds for the continued development of the open protocol, including an updated contract and SDK. We will use 100% of the funds for development, e.g. in the form of public bounties.\n\n\n## Progress\n\nIn the past year, we went from zero to live protocol during Backdrop Build V3, and we were selected as V3 and V4 finalists. We launched a developer SDK, which has received 1.3K+ downloads to date. We are preparing to deploy the updated version of our smart contract and SDK V2 with additional core features as well as our open-source front-end.\n\nSDK V1 Core Features:\n- OTTP ID creation\n- Sign in with Farcaster ID (FID)\n- Contribution attestations\n\nSDK V2 New Core Features:\n- ORG ID creation\n- Sign in with Ethereum address\n- User and organization profiles \n- Project pages\n- Proposals\n- Milestones\n\n\n## Infra and Tech Stack\n\n- [Base](https://base.org)\n- [Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)](https://attest.org)\n- [Farcaster](https://farcaster.xyz)\n- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org)\n- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)\n- [Neynar](https://neynar.com) \n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)\n- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org)\n\n\n## Links\n\n- [Website](https://opentothepublic.org)\n- [Documentation](https://docs.opentothepublic.org)\n- [Github](https://github.com/opentothepublic)\n- [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/ottp.bsky.social)\n- Farcaster: [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/ottp)\n- Community: [Warpcast channel](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/ottp)\n- Lens: [Hey](https://hey.xyz/u/ottp__)\n- [X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/ottp__)\n- [Zora](https://zora.co/@ottp)\n\n\n## Contributors\n\n- Krish: [X](https://x.com/lowcodekrish) | [Github](https://github.com/ronykris)\n- Matt: [X](https://x.com/codeStein_) | [Github](https://github.com/MattWeinstein)\n- Nate: [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/naaate) | [X](https://x.com/nathansvan) | [Github](https://github.com/nathansvan)\n- Peter: [X](https://x.com/code_z2) | [Github](https://github.com/code-z2)\n- Ting: [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/ting) | [X](https://x.com/ting) | [Github](https://github.com/tingwxyz)",

      "description": "# The protocol for open collaboration. Built on Base. Co-create, attest, and own your collaboration graph, forever.\n\nThink of it as a decentralized work/contribution graph that’s powered by onchain attestations. It’s the collaboration layer on top of EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service). Every connection and contribution is verified by your collaborators.\n\nApps built on the protocol will enable you to:\n- create projects\n- contribute and receive credit\n- remix/fork projects\n\n\n## Problem\n\nYour work contributions are siloed in various projects, self-reported and unverified, and locked into closed platforms like LinkedIn and GitHub.\n\n![Current State to Future State](https://i.imgur.com/ktAPsPf.png)\n\n## Solution\n\nYou own verified records of what you’ve done and who you collaborated with.\n\nContributions are recognized and provable, verified by collaborators via onchain attestations, and self-custodial, meaning your collaboration graph can move freely between apps/clients.\n\n\n## How It Works\n\nOTTP protocol design using onchain attestations:\n- **Subjects:** identities who take actions\n- **Objects:** containers created by subjects\n- **Blocks:** object subcomponents created by subjects\n- **Links:** verified connections between subjects and objects\n\n![OTTP subjects and objects](https://i.imgur.com/SS7f4jJ.png)\n\nAny subject (individual or team) can create an object. To start, there are four object types:\n- Project\n- Proposal\n- Milestone\n- Contribution\n\nBlocks are subcomponents that can point to onchain or off-chain data (files, images, links, etc.). Every link (connection) between subjects and/or objects can be verified by an onchain attestation.\n\n![OTTP subjects, objects, and blocks example](https://i.imgur.com/WZdGMiV.png)\n\nSee our [website](https://opentothepublic.org) and [docs](https://docs.opentothepublic.org) for more information about the protocol. View the [user flow here](https://www.figma.com/board/0OM3ythk8oWeehhLonKYc8/OTTP-user-flow?node-id=1-45&t=JNgFhLWZNrMEiMuW-1).\n\n\n\n## Web client\n\nTo demo the protocol, we’re developing an open-source web client built on OTTP. It will demonstrate how users can easily **find collaborators**, **contribute to projects**, and **put their work onchain**.\n\nExplore the [Figma prototype](https://bit.ly/ottp-web-client-v0-prototype) and view the work-in progress in our [Github repo](https://github.com/opentothepublic/ottp-web-client/tree/dev).\n\n![OTTP web client v0](https://i.imgur.com/lbtN3Vs.png)\n\n\nThe OTTP front-end will include the basic core features, with a less opinionated structure, which allows different builders to customize it and create clients focused around certain communities or audience segments (DAOs, fractional workers, etc.).\n\nWe are raising funds for the continued development of the open protocol, including an updated contract and SDK. We will use 100% of the funds for development, e.g. in the form of public bounties.\n\n\n## Progress\n\nIn the past year, we went from zero to live protocol during Backdrop Build V3, and we were selected as V3 and V4 finalists. We launched a developer SDK, which has received 1.3K+ downloads to date. We are preparing to deploy the updated version of our smart contract and SDK V2 with additional core features as well as our open-source front-end.\n\nSDK V1 Core Features:\n- OTTP ID creation\n- Sign in with Farcaster ID (FID)\n- Contribution attestations\n\nSDK V2 New Core Features:\n- ORG ID creation\n- Sign in with Ethereum address\n- User and organization profiles \n- Project pages\n- Proposals\n- Milestones\n\n\n## Infra and Tech Stack\n\n- [Base](https://base.org)\n- [Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)](https://attest.org)\n- [Farcaster](https://farcaster.xyz)\n- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org)\n- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)\n- [Neynar](https://neynar.com) \n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)\n- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org)\n\n\n## Links\n\n- [Website](https://opentothepublic.org)\n- [Documentation](https://docs.opentothepublic.org)\n- [Github](https://github.com/opentothepublic)\n- [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/ottp.bsky.social)\n- Farcaster: [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/ottp)\n- Community: [Warpcast channel](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/ottp)\n- Lens: [Hey](https://hey.xyz/u/ottp__)\n- [X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/ottp__)\n- [Zora](https://zora.co/@ottp)\n\n\n## Contributors\n\n- Krish: [X](https://x.com/lowcodekrish) | [Github](https://github.com/ronykris)\n- Matt: [X](https://x.com/codeStein_) | [Github](https://github.com/MattWeinstein)\n- Nate: [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/naaate) | [X](https://x.com/nathansvan) | [Github](https://github.com/nathansvan)\n- Peter: [X](https://x.com/code_z2) | [Github](https://github.com/code-z2)\n- Ting: [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/ting) | [X](https://x.com/ting) | [Github](https://github.com/tingwxyz)",
