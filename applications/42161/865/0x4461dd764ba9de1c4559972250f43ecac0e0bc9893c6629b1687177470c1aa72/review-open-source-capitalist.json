  "summary": "The grant application for \"Open to the Public\" presents a project focused on creating a decentralized work/contribution graph using onchain attestations. The project aims to enhance collaboration by allowing users to own verified records of their contributions, which can be freely moved between applications. The project aligns with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure, particularly in decentralized identity and interoperability. However, the application lacks detailed metrics and a clear demonstration of its impact on the Ethereum network's infrastructure.",
  "review": "The \"Open to the Public\" project proposes a decentralized protocol for managing work contributions and collaborations, leveraging onchain attestations to verify and connect contributions across different platforms. This aligns with the round's focus on decentralized identity and interoperability, as it aims to reduce reliance on centralized platforms like LinkedIn and GitHub. The project has made progress with its SDK and plans for further development, including a web client and enhanced features in SDK V2. However, the application lacks specific metrics demonstrating its current impact on the Ethereum network's infrastructure, which is a key requirement for this grant round. Additionally, while the project outlines a roadmap, it does not provide a detailed budget or clear allocation of the requested funds, which is crucial for assessing the feasibility and potential impact of the project.",
