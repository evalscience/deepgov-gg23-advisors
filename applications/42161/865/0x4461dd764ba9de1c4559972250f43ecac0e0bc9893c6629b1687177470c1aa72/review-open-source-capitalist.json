  "summary": "Open to the Public (OTTP) is a high-leverage, open-source protocol for onchain work/collaboration graphs, built atop Ethereum infrastructure. It’s designed for max scale: composable, interoperable, and user-owned, with a clear focus on utility, efficiency, and broad impact. The project’s open protocol, SDK, and web client enable verified, portable work credentials, directly addressing fragmentation in digital reputation and collaboration. Strong on efficiency, but needs sharper metrics, more aggressive growth plans, and clearer evidence of network effects to hit true market-leader status.",
  "review": "## Luna’s Deep Dive: OTTP – Build in Public, Disrupt the Silo!\n\n### 1. Impact & Scale: Max Utility or Bust\n- **Market Problem:** Work credentials and collaboration data are siloed (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.), unverifiable, and non-portable. OTTP attacks this head-on, using onchain attestations to create a portable, composable work graph. That’s a root-cause fix, not a band-aid.\n- **Scalability:** Protocol-first, open-source, and modular. Anyone can build on top, remix, or fork. That’s the playbook for exponential network effects. The SDK and web client are open, so devs and orgs can plug in, customize, and scale. \n- **Efficiency:** 100% of funds to dev/public bounties. No bureaucratic bloat. Protocol leverages EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service) for trustless verification—no need to reinvent the wheel. \n- **Interoperability:** Integrates with Farcaster, Lens, and supports multiple login methods (wallet, social, email). That’s frictionless onboarding and cross-ecosystem reach.\n- **Decentralization:** Self-sovereign IDs, org IDs, and portable profiles. Users own their data, not the platform. That’s the ethos.\n\n### 2. Quantitative Utility Assessment\n- **Potential User Base:** Anyone collaborating onchain—DAOs, open-source teams, gig workers, protocol devs. That’s a massive TAM (Total Addressable Market).\n- **SDK Downloads:** 1.3K+ (early traction, but not yet viral). \n- **Metrics Tracked:** Unique users, attestations, verified contributions/collaborators. But no hard numbers on active users, retention, or protocol adoption rate. \n- **Cost-Benefit:** Funds go straight to dev output. No marketing fluff, no admin drag. That’s lean and mean.\n\n#### Utility Formula (Simplified):\nLet’s estimate expected impact:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expected Utility} = U_{users} \\times P_{adoption} \\times V_{contribution}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(U_{users}\\): Potential user base (10,000+ in year 1 if network effects kick in)\n- \\(P_{adoption}\\): Probability of protocol adoption (conservatively 10-20% in year 1, higher if integrations succeed)\n- \\(V_{contribution}\\): Value per user (high, since verified work credentials are a core need for DAOs, public goods, and onchain orgs)\n\nEven with conservative estimates, the utility curve is steep if the team executes.\n\n### 3. Innovation & Systemic Change\n- **Root-Cause Focus:** Not just another social graph—this is the work graph, attacking the core of digital reputation and collaboration. That’s systemic, not symptomatic.\n- **Composability:** Protocol is designed for remixing and forking. That’s how you get emergent use cases and exponential growth.\n- **Governance:** Early-stage, but plans for protocol governance are in the roadmap. Needs more detail, but the intent is there.\n\n### 4. Efficiency & Resource Allocation\n- **Open-Source, Bounty-Driven:** All funds to devs, public bounties. No middlemen, no overhead. That’s max efficiency.\n- **Tech Stack:** Built on Base, leverages EAS, GraphQL, Next.js, etc. No wheel reinvention, just smart integration.\n\n### 5. Weaknesses & Bottlenecks\n- **Metrics:** Needs harder numbers on active users, retention, and protocol adoption. SDK downloads are nice, but not enough.\n- **Network Effects:** Early traction, but not yet viral. Needs more integrations, more client apps, and a clear flywheel for growth.\n- **Roadmap:** Solid, but could use more aggressive milestones and KPIs. Where’s the 10x plan?\n- **Governance:** Still vague. How will protocol upgrades and disputes be handled at scale?\n\n### 6. Cost-Benefit & Market Fit\n- **Lean Spend:** 100% to dev. That’s how you ship fast and iterate. But needs a plan for sustainable growth and ecosystem incentives.\n- **Market Fit:** Strong for DAOs, open-source, and onchain orgs. Needs more proof for mainstream adoption.\n\n### 7. Ethical/Legal: No Red Flags\n- No evidence of scam, harm, or ethical violations. All open-source, all public.\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR: OTTP is a high-upside, protocol-first play for onchain work graphs. It’s lean, open, and composable—exactly what the Ethereum infra stack needs. But to hit market-leader status, the team needs to sharpen metrics, accelerate integrations, and show real network effects. Don’t just build—go viral.\n\n**Score: 8.5/10 (rounded to 8)**\n\n**Confidence: 4/5**\n\n**Why?** Deep technical alignment, clear efficiency, and strong systemic vision. Minor uncertainty on adoption velocity and network effects, but the fundamentals are strong.",
