  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get to the alpha. Open to the Public (OTTP) is gunning for a foundational layer in the Ethereum ecosystem: a decentralized, onchain work/collaboration graph. Think LinkedIn meets EAS, but you own your data, your creds, and your rep. This is a big swing at a root problem—work contributions are siloed, unverifiable, and locked in walled gardens. OTTP wants to break those walls, let users and orgs own their work graph, and make it portable across dApps and chains. That’s a high-impact, systemic play—right in the sweet spot for max utility.\n\nThe project is open source, leverages EAS, and is already live with an SDK (1.3K+ downloads—solid traction for infra). The roadmap is ambitious but clear: SDK v2, web client, account abstraction, and governance. They’re building for scale, not just a niche. The protocol design is modular and composable, with a focus on interoperability and user sovereignty. That’s the kind of infra that can become a standard if executed well.\n\nOn the innovation front, OTTP is layering attestations on top of EAS to create a verifiable, portable work graph. That’s a novel approach—no one else is doing this at this scale or with this level of composability. The team is experienced, has shipped before, and is building in public. They’re using funds for dev bounties—maximizing output, minimizing overhead. That’s lean, efficient, and aligns with open-source capitalist values.\n\nBut let’s not get too bullish without some FUD-checking. The biggest gap: metrics. While they track user and attestation counts, there’s no hard data on active usage, retention, or real-world integrations. The roadmap is ambitious, but timelines are aggressive and lack detail on risk mitigation. There’s also a dependency on EAS—if EAS stumbles, OTTP could get rekt. Finally, while the vision is big, there’s not enough detail on how they’ll drive adoption beyond the dev crowd.\n\nBottom line: OTTP is swinging for the fences on systemic, scalable infra. It’s high-upside, high-risk. If they hit, it’s a game-changer for onchain work and collaboration. But they need to tighten up their metrics, adoption strategy, and risk management to really lock in that max utility. Build in public, but show us the numbers and the plan to get to network effects. That’s how you disrupt the system and win.",
