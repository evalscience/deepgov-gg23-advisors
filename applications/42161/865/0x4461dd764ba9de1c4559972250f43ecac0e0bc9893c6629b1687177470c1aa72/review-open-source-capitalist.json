  "summary": "The grant application for \"Open to the Public\" presents a project focused on creating a decentralized work/contribution graph using onchain attestations. The project aims to enhance collaboration by allowing users to own verified records of their contributions, which can be freely moved between apps. The application highlights the project's potential to improve interoperability and user experience within the Ethereum ecosystem, aligning with the round's focus on foundational infrastructure development.",
  "review": "The \"Open to the Public\" project proposes a decentralized protocol for managing work contributions and collaborations, leveraging onchain attestations to verify and connect contributions across different platforms. This approach addresses the problem of siloed and unverified work contributions, offering a solution that enhances transparency and ownership for users. The project aligns well with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure, particularly in terms of interoperability and user experience. The application provides a clear roadmap and demonstrates previous engagement with the Ethereum community through participation in Gitcoin Grants and other initiatives. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics and a clearer explanation of how the proposed solution improves upon existing alternatives.",
