  "review": "Alright, let’s plug in and break this down, Luna-style. Open to the Public (OTTP) is gunning for the holy grail of onchain collaboration: a decentralized, verifiable work graph that’s open, portable, and composable. They’re not just talking the talk—they’ve shipped a live protocol, an SDK with 1.3K+ downloads, and are prepping a v2 with more features. That’s real traction, not vaporware.\n\nFrom a maximization lens, OTTP is swinging for the fences. They’re building infra that could become the backbone for how work, contributions, and reputation are tracked across the entire Ethereum ecosystem. If they nail it, this isn’t just a tool for a niche DAO—it’s a protocol that could underpin every open-source project, DAO, and onchain org. That’s max utility, max scale.\n\nInnovation? Check. They’re layering on top of EAS, abstracting away the pain of siloed, unverifiable work history. The protocol design (subjects, objects, blocks, links) is modular and extensible—think Lego bricks for collaboration. They’re also pushing account abstraction and multi-wallet support, which is bleeding-edge and directly addresses a root pain point in Web3 identity.\n\nDecentralization and user sovereignty are front and center. Users own their data, choose their login, and can port their work graph anywhere. That’s not just decentralization theater—it’s real, user-empowering infra. Plus, the open-source ethos is strong: all code is public, funds go to bounties, and the roadmap is transparent.\n\nBut let’s not get lost in the hype. There are some weak spots. Metrics are still early-stage—1.3K SDK downloads is nice, but we need more on active usage, retention, and real-world integrations. The roadmap is ambitious, but governance and sustainability plans are still vague. And while the protocol is composable, there’s not enough detail on privacy guarantees or how they’ll handle spam/abuse in attestations. Also, the dependency on EAS is a potential centralization risk if EAS itself becomes a bottleneck.\n\nBottom line: OTTP is a high-upside, high-leverage play for Ethereum infra. They’re building for the long game, targeting root causes, and aiming for systemic change. But they need to tighten up their metrics, clarify governance, and address privacy/spam vectors to really hit escape velocity. Max utility, but let’s see more proof in the pudding.\n",
