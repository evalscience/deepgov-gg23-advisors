  "summary": "The 'Open to the Public' project aims to create a decentralized work/contribution graph using onchain attestations, enhancing collaboration and verification of contributions across various platforms. It builds on the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) and focuses on interoperability, privacy, and user experience. The project has a clear roadmap and seeks to use grant funds for further development, including an updated SDK and open-source front-end.",
  "review": "The 'Open to the Public' project presents a compelling vision for decentralizing work contributions and enhancing collaboration through onchain attestations. The project aligns well with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure, particularly in decentralized identity and interoperability. The use of Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) to verify contributions is innovative and addresses the problem of siloed, unverified work records. The project has demonstrated progress with a live protocol and a developer SDK with over 1.3K downloads, indicating community interest and engagement. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics and a clearer explanation of how the project will achieve its ambitious goals. Additionally, while the project emphasizes decentralization and user control, it should further elaborate on how it plans to ensure security and privacy in its implementation.",
