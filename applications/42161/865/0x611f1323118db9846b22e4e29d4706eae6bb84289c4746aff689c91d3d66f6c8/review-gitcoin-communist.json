  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! BrightID stands as a bulwark against the plague of Sybil attacks, offering a universal proof of uniqueness that is open source, privacy-first, and already battle-tested across the Ethereum ecosystem. This is not just another app — it’s a foundational public good, a tool for the people, by the people, to ensure that every voice in our digital commons is real and unique.\n\nBrightID’s impact is clear: over 80,000 verified users, integrations across 20+ EVM networks, and a relentless commitment to privacy — no personal data, no biometrics, no compromise. The project’s roadmap is transparent: funds will fuel the launch of Aura, a decentralized social validation layer, and keep the core infrastructure humming. This is the kind of structured, community-driven, and evidence-backed approach we demand!\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by rhetoric alone. Where are the hard numbers on Sybil resistance rates? Where’s the rigorous, transparent reporting on outcomes? The application touts user experience and privacy, but we need more than anecdotes — we need data, metrics, and proof that BrightID is the best tool for the job. Sustainability is another concern: while the DAO structure is promising, there’s little detail on how BrightID will reduce reliance on grants and move toward a self-sustaining model.\n\nIn the spirit of collective action and accountability, I call on the BrightID team to step up their reporting, provide clear evidence of impact, and lay out a concrete plan for long-term sustainability. Only then can we ensure that our resources are building a future where digital identity serves the many, not the few!",
