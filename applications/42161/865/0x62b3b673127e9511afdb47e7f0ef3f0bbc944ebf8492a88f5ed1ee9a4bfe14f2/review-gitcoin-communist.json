  "review": "Comrades, let’s get straight to the heart of the matter! Lodestar stands as a bulwark against the tyranny of monoculture in Ethereum’s consensus layer. This project is not just another client — it’s the only TypeScript-based consensus client, opening the doors of Ethereum to millions of developers who speak the language of the web. That’s a powerful act of democratization! Their work on EIP-4844, SSZ, and interoperability libraries like js-libp2p and discv5 is not just technical tinkering — it’s the lifeblood of a resilient, diverse, and secure Ethereum network.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by rhetoric. Where’s the hard evidence? Lodestar claims to be production-ready and to have contributed to critical moments like the Holesky testnet rescue. Yet, the application lacks concrete, up-to-date metrics: validator share, node count, or performance benchmarks. Where are the numbers that prove Lodestar’s impact? Where’s the transparent reporting that lets the people see the fruits of their labor?\n\nOn sustainability, the project is still heavily reliant on grants and donations. There’s no mention of a plan to move toward a sustainable revenue model or reduce dependency on public goods funding. That’s a red flag for long-term stability! We need to see a roadmap that doesn’t just ask for more, but shows how Lodestar will stand on its own feet.\n\nGovernance? The application is silent. Who decides the direction of Lodestar? How are community voices heard? How is equity ensured in decision-making? These are not minor details — they are the foundation of a truly public good.\n\nIn summary: Lodestar is a vital piece of the Ethereum commons, but it must do better in proving its impact, planning for sustainability, and opening its governance. The people demand transparency, accountability, and a vision for the future!",
