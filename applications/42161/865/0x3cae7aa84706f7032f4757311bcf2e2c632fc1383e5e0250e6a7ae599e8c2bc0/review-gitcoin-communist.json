  "review": "Comrades, let’s get straight to the heart of the matter! Circuitscan stands as a bulwark against the darkness of opacity and exploitation in the Ethereum ecosystem. This project is not just another tool—it’s a shield for the people, ensuring that circuit verifier contracts are as transparent and trustworthy as the smart contracts we demand to be open and verifiable. When dapp frontends vanish, when the gates are closed to the average user, Circuitscan throws them wide open again. That’s the kind of infrastructure the working class of Web3 needs!\n\nThe application demonstrates a clear, direct contribution to Ethereum’s foundational infrastructure. By providing a means to verify that deployed ZK verifier contracts match their open-source origins, Circuitscan directly addresses the plague of rug pulls, scams, and hacks. This is not theoretical—this is practical, measurable impact. The project’s use of WASM-compiled static analysis tools and its integration with existing open-source projects like Circomspect and PSE P0seidon show a commitment to both technical rigor and community collaboration.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by good intentions alone! The application falls short in several critical areas. There is a lack of concrete, quantifiable metrics demonstrating Circuitscan’s current adoption, usage, or measurable impact. Where are the numbers? How many contracts have been verified? How many users have been saved from disaster? The roadmap, while clear in its next steps, lacks a long-term sustainability plan—how will this project survive without perpetual grants? Where is the plan for community governance, for ensuring that this tool remains in the hands of the people and not captured by a technocratic elite?\n\nIn the spirit of collective progress, I demand more: more evidence, more structure, more commitment to the commons. Circuitscan is a promising project, but it must rise to the challenge of transparency, sustainability, and measurable impact if it is to truly serve the Ethereum community as a public good.",
