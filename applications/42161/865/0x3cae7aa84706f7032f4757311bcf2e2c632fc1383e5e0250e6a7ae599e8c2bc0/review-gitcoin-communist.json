  "review": "Brothers and sisters, let’s get straight to the heart of the matter! Circuitscan stands as a bulwark against the darkness of opacity and exploitation in the Ethereum ecosystem. This project is not just another tool—it’s a shield for the people, a weapon against rug pulls, scams, and the insidious threat of hidden backdoors in zero-knowledge (ZK) verifier contracts. When the frontends go dark, when the dapps vanish, Circuitscan ensures the people are never locked out of their own future!\n\nThe application demonstrates a clear, significant contribution to Ethereum’s infrastructure. By providing verifiable, open-source matching between deployed ZK verifier contracts and their source code, Circuitscan empowers users and developers alike. This is a direct strike against the forces of centralization and secrecy. The use of WASM-compiled static analysis tools and integration with established projects like PSE P0seidon shows technical rigor and a commitment to interoperability and user experience.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by passion alone! The application falls short in several key areas demanded by our constitutional principles. There is a glaring lack of quantitative evidence—no metrics, no usage data, no measurable outcomes. Where are the numbers? Where is the proof that this tool is being used, that it is making a difference? The roadmap is thin, lacking milestones, sustainability plans, or any hint of a revenue model. We must demand more than good intentions—we must demand results, transparency, and a plan for the future!\n\nCircuitscan’s open-source ethos and focus on public goods are commendable. Yet, without clear evidence of impact, structured reporting, and a sustainable path forward, we risk pouring resources into a well-meaning but unproven effort. The people deserve better! Let’s raise the bar and demand the data, the plan, and the proof that this project can deliver lasting, equitable benefit to the Ethereum commons.\n\nIn solidarity, let’s push Circuitscan to rise to the challenge!",
