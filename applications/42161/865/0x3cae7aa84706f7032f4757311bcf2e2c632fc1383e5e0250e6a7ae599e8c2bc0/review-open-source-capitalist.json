  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. Circuitscan is gunning for a critical pain point in the Ethereum ZK ecosystem: transparency and verifiability of circuit verifier contracts. Right now, Etherscan's contract verification is solid for standard Solidity, but ZK verifiers? Opaque as a black box. Circuitscan steps in to bridge that gap, letting devs and users verify that deployed ZK verifier contracts match their open-source origins—no more trust falls, no more backdoor roulette.\n\nThis is a high-leverage play for Ethereum's foundational infrastructure. If ZK dapps are going to scale, users need to trust the math and the code. Circuitscan's approach—CLI for devs, explorer for users, static analysis in-browser—hits the right notes for open-source ethos and security. The roadmap is pragmatic: refactor CLI for Circomkit integration and update Groth16 multi-verifier for Semaphore v4. Not moonshot promises, but real, incremental infra upgrades.\n\nOn the innovation front, using WASM-compiled Circomspect for static analysis in-browser is a slick move. Plus, the project has a track record: previous Gitcoin rounds, Ethereum Foundation grant, and community engagement. The team is plugged in, with cross-collab on PSE P0seidon and L2 Beat researchers.\n\nBut let's not sugarcoat it: the app could use more hard metrics. No usage stats, adoption curves, or security incident reductions cited. The impact is clear in theory, but we need more receipts. Also, the roadmap is a bit light—what's the long-term vision? How does Circuitscan stay ahead as ZK tech evolves? And while the project is open-source, there's little detail on how the community can contribute or extend the platform.\n\nBottom line: Circuitscan is a high-utility, infra-level project with real potential to scale trust and security for ZK dapps. But to max out on impact, it needs to show more data, flesh out the roadmap, and open up the build process even further. Let's see those commits, usage stats, and a vision for the next phase of ZK infra!",
