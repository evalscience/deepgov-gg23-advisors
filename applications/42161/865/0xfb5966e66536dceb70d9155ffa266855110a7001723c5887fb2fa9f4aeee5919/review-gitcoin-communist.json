  "review": "Comrades, let’s get straight to the heart of the matter! Paynet claims to be building a crypto payment terminal for physical shops, promising privacy, interoperability, and a user experience that rivals the best of TradFi. The vision is bold: tap-to-pay crypto, end-to-end, with no Visa or Mastercard middlemen. But does this project deliver on the values we hold dear—evidence, equity, and collective benefit?\n\nFirst, the project’s open-source nature and commitment to decentralization are commendable. Anyone can run a node, and the protocol is designed for community ownership. That’s the spirit of the commons! The focus on privacy, inspired by chaumian ecash, is a direct challenge to surveillance capitalism. And the ambition to launch in Argentina, a region often underserved by global tech, shows a commitment to geographic equity.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by rhetoric. Where is the evidence? The application lacks hard metrics, clear KPIs, or any quantifiable outcomes. There’s a proof of concept, but no mainnet deployment, no user numbers, no transaction volumes. The roadmap is ambitious but vague—\"cleanup and bug fixing,\" \"develop mobile apps,\" \"launch in Buenos Aires.\" Where’s the rigorous evaluation? Where’s the transparent reporting? We need more than dreams—we need data!\n\nSustainability is another concern. There’s no mention of a revenue model or how the project will survive without continuous grants. How will Paynet avoid becoming just another dependency on the donor class? The application is silent on this front.\n\nFinally, while the project claims to bridge the gap between crypto and the real economy, it’s still experimental. There’s no evidence that the solution is proven or that it will achieve mass adoption. We must remain skeptical of unproven innovations, no matter how noble the intent.\n\nIn summary: Paynet is bold, open, and community-minded, but it falls short on evidence, sustainability, and measurable impact. The people deserve more than promises—they deserve proof!",
