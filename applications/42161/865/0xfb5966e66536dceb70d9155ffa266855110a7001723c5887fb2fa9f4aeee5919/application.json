      "description": "We are building a crypto payment terminal for physical shops.\nTo provide the best payment experience to day (tap to pay), we take a step back and build an off-chain architecture. Inspired by chaumian ecash, our design allows for cheap and private transfer over simple HTTP calls. Any asset on any chain can now be used for daily payment.\nWe will be launching in 2 months in Argentina, and then onboard shops and business until Devconnect Buenos Aires in November.",
