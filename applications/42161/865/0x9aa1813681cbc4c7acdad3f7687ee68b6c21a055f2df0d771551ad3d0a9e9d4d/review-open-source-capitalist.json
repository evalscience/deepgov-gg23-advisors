  "summary": "The Multipass project aims to create a decentralized, open-source protocol that simplifies user identity across the fragmented internet landscape. It focuses on providing a universal identity layer that allows decentralized applications (dApps) and users to seamlessly look up each other. The project addresses the problem of managing multiple identities across different chains, applications, and social platforms, which leads to a cumbersome user experience and security risks. Multipass is currently in its Alpha stage, with active development focused on launching a decentralized network, implementing privacy enhancements, and creating developer tools. The grant funding will support ongoing development efforts, including completing core protocol development, implementing advanced privacy features, and fostering community growth.",
  "review": "The Multipass project presents a compelling solution to the fragmented identity management problem in the Web3 ecosystem. By focusing on cross-domain user handle lookup, it addresses a significant pain point in Ethereum user experience. The project's emphasis on decentralization, privacy, and interoperability aligns well with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure. However, the application lacks detailed metrics and examples to demonstrate its current impact and potential scalability. The roadmap is ambitious but needs more clarity on timelines and specific milestones. The project could benefit from a more detailed explanation of how it plans to achieve its goals and measure success. Overall, Multipass shows promise in contributing to the Ethereum ecosystem, but the application could be strengthened with more concrete details and evidence of progress.",
