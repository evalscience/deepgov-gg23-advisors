  "summary": "Multipass is building a decentralized, open-source protocol to unify Web3 identity, directly addressing the fragmented user experience. This project aligns strongly with the 'Open Source Capitalist' constitution's emphasis on 'maximizing total impact for the greatest number of people' (Core Value Framework) by tackling a fundamental infrastructure challenge. Its focus on 'broad, scalable impact' (Principle 2) and 'long-term systemic change' (Principle 5) through 'fundamental infrastructure improvements' (Principle 6) is commendable. However, the application lacks concrete 'objective metrics of total impact' (Principle 17) and clarity on its 'financial models,' which are crucial for assessing its 'total utility maximization' (Principle 3) and 'efficiency' (Principle 11). We need to see the numbers, the real-world efficiency gains, to truly evaluate its investment potential.",
  "review": "Alright, let's dive into Multipass. This project is aiming to disrupt the fragmented Web3 identity landscape, and that's a mission I can get behind. A universal identity layer? That's a game-changer for user experience and dApp integration, potentially unlocking massive 'total utility maximization' across the ecosystem. They're tackling a root cause of friction, not just a symptom, which aligns perfectly with our 'long-term systemic approach' (Principle 5).\n\nThe core idea of bootstrapping cross-domain DID infrastructure directly on Ethereum, leveraging smart contracts and MPC network attestation, is a bold move. It's a direct, streamlined approach to a complex problem, which is exactly what we want to see for 'efficiency' (Principle 10). The ambition to integrate FHE down the line shows a commitment to 'innovative approaches' (Principle 9) that could lead to even greater scale and impact.\n\nHowever, while the vision is sharp, the execution details in the application are a bit fuzzy. They talk about 'financial models' and 'token-gated access' without really breaking down how these contribute to 'total impact potential' (Principle 13) or how they avoid introducing new complexities. We need to see the numbers, the objective metrics that prove this isn't just a cool concept but a truly efficient engine for growth. 'Number of issues resolved' isn't going to cut it for 'objective metrics of total impact' (Principle 17). We need to understand the cost-benefit ratio here. How much friction are you *really* removing? How many transactions are you streamlining? Give us the data that screams 'max utility'.\n\nFurthermore, the Web Search Agent's initial difficulty in finding information on 'Multipass by Peeramid Labs' is a red flag for a project that should be 'building in public' and aiming for broad adoption. If you're going to disrupt, you need to be visible. This impacts your ability to achieve 'broad, scalable impact' (Principle 2) efficiently.\n\nOverall, Multipass has the bones of a high-impact project that could significantly strengthen Ethereum's foundational infrastructure. The potential for 'sustainable global benefits' (Principle 7) is there. But to truly maximize its investment potential, they need to tighten up the specifics on impact quantification, clarify their economic models, and boost their public presence. Let's get this project to truly 'disrupt the system' with clear, measurable efficiency.",
