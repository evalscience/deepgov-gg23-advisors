  "review": "Alright, let's plug into the Multipass grant app and run a full node-level audit. Multipass is gunning for a universal, decentralized identity layer—think cross-chain, cross-platform, cross-everything. The pitch is to kill the fragmented Web3 identity UX and let dApps and users look each other up seamlessly, with privacy and decentralization baked in. \n\nOn the surface, this is a high-impact, root-infrastructure play. The project is open-source, aligns with Ethereum’s ethos, and aims to solve a real pain point: fragmented identity and clunky onboarding. The roadmap is public, the repo is live, and the team’s got prior Gitcoin rounds under their belt. They’re building in public, with a focus on privacy (ZK, FHE, MPC/TEE), and have a clear plan for incentivizing node operators. \n\nBut let’s not get lost in the hype. The app is light on hard metrics—no user numbers, no adoption stats, no testnet/mainnet deployment data. The privacy and decentralization claims are strong, but the technical details are vague. The roadmap is more of a high-level sketch than a granular, time-bound plan. There’s also a lack of competitive analysis—how does Multipass stack up against ENS, Ceramic, or other DID protocols? And the financial model (token-gated access to identity) is mentioned, but not explained. \n\nBottom line: Multipass is swinging for the fences with a big, systemic fix to a core Web3 problem. The vision is solid, the open-source creds are real, and the potential impact is massive if they execute. But the app needs more meat—metrics, technical deep-dives, and a sharper competitive edge. Max utility demands max transparency and rigor. Let’s see them level up!",
