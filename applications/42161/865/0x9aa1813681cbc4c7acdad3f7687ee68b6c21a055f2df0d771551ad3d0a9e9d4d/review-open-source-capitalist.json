  "summary": "Multipass is a decentralized, open-source protocol aimed at simplifying user identity across the fragmented Web3 landscape. It seeks to unify digital identities by providing a universal identity layer that allows decentralized applications (dApps) and users to seamlessly look up each other across different platforms. The project is in its Alpha stage, focusing on launching a decentralized network, enhancing privacy, and developing tools for easy dApp integration. The grant will support ongoing development efforts, including the completion of core protocol development, implementation of privacy features, and community growth initiatives.",
  "review": "The Multipass project presents a compelling solution to the fragmented identity management in the Web3 ecosystem. By focusing on cross-domain user handle lookup, it addresses a significant pain point in Ethereum's user experience. The project is innovative in its approach to decentralization and privacy, leveraging technologies like zero-knowledge proofs and token-gated access to identity details. However, the application lacks detailed metrics and specific examples of its current impact on the Ethereum network's infrastructure. The roadmap is ambitious but needs clearer milestones and timelines to ensure accountability and progress tracking. Additionally, while the project emphasizes privacy and decentralization, it should provide more concrete details on how these principles are implemented and measured.",
