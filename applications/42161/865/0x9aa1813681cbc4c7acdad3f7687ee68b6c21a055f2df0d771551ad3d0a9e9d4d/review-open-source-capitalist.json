  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get to the core. Multipass is gunning for a universal, decentralized identity layer for Web3—think of it as the DNS for user handles across chains and platforms. That’s a big swing at a root problem: fragmented identity and UX hell in Ethereum and beyond. The project is open-source, building in public, and aiming for a protocol that dApps can plug into for seamless cross-domain lookups. \n\nStrengths? Multipass is laser-focused on infrastructure-level impact. It’s not just another privacy wrapper or a walled garden—it's a protocol play, with on-chain contracts and off-chain MPC/TEE for privacy. The roadmap is public, the code is open, and the team’s got a track record in previous Gitcoin rounds. They’re not just talking—they’re shipping (see their GitHub and Karma GAP updates).\n\nBut let’s not sugarcoat it: the app is light on hard metrics and adoption data. There’s a lot of talk about what Multipass will do, but not enough about what it’s already done. The privacy and decentralization claims are promising, but the technical details are thin—how exactly will on-chain FHE or MPC/TEE be implemented? What’s the threat model? Also, the financial model (token-gated access to identity) is innovative, but could introduce friction or privacy trade-offs if not handled right.\n\nRequested changes: Multipass needs to show more receipts. Give us hard adoption numbers, testnet/mainnet deployments, and concrete privacy architecture. Spell out the threat model and how you’ll avoid centralization risks in registrar services. And clarify how token-gated access won’t undermine user privacy or create new attack surfaces.\n\nBottom line: Multipass is swinging for the fences on impact and scalability, but needs to tighten up on technical transparency and measurable outcomes. If they deliver, this could be a game-changer for Ethereum infra. But right now, it’s more potential than proof. Show us the code, show us the users, and let’s get this thing to mainnet.",
