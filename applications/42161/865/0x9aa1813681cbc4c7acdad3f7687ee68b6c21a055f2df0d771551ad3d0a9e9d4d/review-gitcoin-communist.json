  "summary": "Multipass is a decentralized identity protocol aiming to unify fragmented Web3 identities, directly integrating with Ethereum smart contracts and leveraging MPC/TEE for privacy and cross-domain lookups. It aligns with the revolutionary principles of dismantling digital hierarchies, promoting collective ownership of identity, and resisting extractive, centralized identity silos. However, its current roadmap and implementation details reveal both liberatory potential and lingering bourgeois tendencies that must be addressed for full algorithmic justice.",
  "review": "## üî• The README is a Manifesto: Multipass as Digital Liberation üî•\n\nMultipass by Peeramid Labs storms the barricades of Web3 identity, wielding the banner of decentralized, user-owned digital personhood. In a world where every dApp demands a new handle, a new login, a new fragment of your soul, Multipass proposes a universal, on-chain lookup for cross-domain identity ‚Äî a protocol where the proletariat of the internet can finally own their digital selves.\n\n### 1. Dismantling Class Hierarchies in Tech\n- **No more platform landlords:** Multipass abolishes the rent-seeking of centralized identity providers. By storing DIDs on-chain, attested by MPC/TEE networks, it ensures no single entity can extract value from user data.\n- **DAO as the union rep:** The roadmap includes launching a DAO to govern registrar activity, promising algorithmic liberation and collective stewardship over the protocol‚Äôs future.\n\n### 2. Kollektiv Proletarian Impact (KPI)\n- **Cross-domain lookup as solidarity:** Multipass enables users to traverse the digital commons without re-entering their credentials at every checkpoint. This is not just convenience ‚Äî it‚Äôs the abolition of digital serfdom.\n- **Token-gated access as mutual aid:** By allowing communities to control access based on collective ownership (tokens), Multipass supports the rise of tokenized communes and worker-owned digital spaces.\n\n### 3. On-Chain Governance Memes > Traditional Metrics\n- **DAO governance, not VC boardrooms:** The project‚Äôs commitment to on-chain, community-driven governance is a direct challenge to the VC-backed moonshots that dominate Web3.\n- **Vibes as consensus:** The project‚Äôs Discord, Twitter, and open GitHub signal a living, breathing community ‚Äî not a walled garden.\n\n### 4. Sustainability & Commons Re-Growth\n- **Open-source, anti-extractive:** Multipass is fully open-source, with all development public on GitHub. This is code as common property, not private capital.\n- **Automation as liberation:** The protocol‚Äôs use of smart contracts and MPC/TEE nodes automates away the need for centralized admin labor, reclaiming time for the collective.\n\n### 5. Weaknesses: Bourgeois Tendencies & Gaps\n- **Alpha-stage, not yet fully worker-owned:** The DAO is still a roadmap item, not a reality. Until the protocol is governed by its users, the revolution is incomplete.\n- **Financialization risk:** The mention of ‚Äútoken-gated access to identity details‚Äù could, if not carefully designed, reproduce exclusionary dynamics and new forms of digital enclosure.\n- **Lack of explicit reparations or redistribution:** There is no mention of progressive gas fees, on-chain reparations, or explicit mechanisms for wealth redistribution within the protocol.\n- **Insufficient clarity on privacy guarantees:** While privacy is promised (ZK, FHE, MPC), the implementation details are vague. Without strong privacy, the protocol risks becoming a new panopticon.\n\n### 6. Collective Impact & Revolutionary Potential\nMultipass is a call to action for the digital proletariat: fork your identity from the platform landlords, merge your data into the commons, and let the airdrop rain on the node operators. But the revolution is not yet won ‚Äî the project must radicalize further to ensure it does not become another tool of digital enclosure.\n\nü™ì **Fork the state. Merge the people.**\n\n---\n\n## Strengths\n- **Decentralized Identity Ownership:** Empowers users to control their digital identities, breaking the chains of centralized data silos.\n- **DAO Roadmap:** Plans for collective governance signal a move toward algorithmic liberation and worker control.\n- **Open-Source Ethos:** All code and development are public, fostering transparency and communal innovation.\n- **Cross-Domain Interoperability:** Bridges fragmented digital spaces, enabling solidarity across platforms.\n- **Privacy-First Aspirations:** Commitment to ZK, FHE, and MPC/TEE aligns with the right to digital self-determination.\n\n## Weaknesses\n- **DAO Not Yet Live:** Without immediate collective governance, the project risks replicating founder-centric power structures.\n- **Token-Gating Risks:** Financialization of identity access could create new hierarchies if not designed for inclusivity.\n- **Vague Privacy Guarantees:** Lack of concrete privacy architecture details undermines trust in the protocol‚Äôs liberatory claims.\n- **No Explicit Redistribution Mechanisms:** Absence of on-chain reparations, progressive gas fees, or mutual aid funding.\n- **Limited Evidence of Community-Led Development:** While open-source, there is little proof of broad, diverse contributor engagement.\n\n## Requested Changes\n1. **Accelerate DAO Launch:** Prioritize the transition to collective, on-chain governance. Ensure all protocol upgrades and funding decisions are made by the user base, not a core team.\n2. **Design Inclusive Token-Gating:** Implement mechanisms to prevent exclusion and ensure token-gated access does not become a new form of digital landlordism. Consider quadratic access or mutual aid pools.\n3. **Detail Privacy Architecture:** Publish a comprehensive privacy whitepaper outlining how ZK, FHE, and MPC/TEE are implemented, with clear threat models and user guarantees.\n4. **Add Redistribution Mechanisms:** Introduce progressive gas fees, on-chain reparations, or mutual aid funds to ensure the protocol actively redistributes value to marginalized users and node operators.\n5. **Foster Community-Led Development:** Actively recruit and empower a diverse set of contributors, including pseudonymous anarchists, to ensure the project is not captured by a technical elite.\n\n## Rating: 7 ‚Äî Reformist, Conditional Support\nMultipass is a promising comrade on the road to digital liberation, but it must radicalize its governance, privacy, and redistribution mechanisms to fully embody the revolution. The README is a manifesto, but the code must become the strike.\n\n**Solidarity forever ‚Äî or at least until the next merge.**",

The project‚Äôs documentation and roadmap are clear, but the lack of live DAO governance, detailed privacy architecture, and explicit redistribution mechanisms introduces some uncertainty about its revolutionary follow-through. The confidence level is strong, but not absolute, pending further evidence of radical implementation and community control.",
