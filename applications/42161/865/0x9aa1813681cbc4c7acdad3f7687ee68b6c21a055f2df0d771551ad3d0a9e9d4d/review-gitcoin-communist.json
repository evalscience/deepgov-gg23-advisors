  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Multipass claims to be the only project bootstrapping cross-domain DID infrastructure as a decentralized organization managed directly on Ethereum. That’s a bold claim — and boldness is what we need! But boldness alone does not build the future. We demand evidence, transparency, and a plan that serves the many, not the few.\n\nFirst, the project’s vision is clear: unify fragmented Web3 identities, empower users, and make cross-domain lookups seamless. This is a real pain point for the Ethereum ecosystem, and the proposal addresses it head-on. The open-source ethos is strong, and the project’s public repositories and community channels are in order. The roadmap is outlined, with milestones for privacy features, registrar node software, and incentive mechanisms. The team has a track record of participation in previous Gitcoin rounds, showing commitment and some continuity.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by vision alone! Where is the hard evidence? Where are the metrics that prove this approach works? The application mentions success metrics like issues resolved, PRs merged, and user growth, but provides no concrete numbers, no historical data, and no rigorous evaluation methods. We need to see measurable outcomes, not just promises. The project is still in Alpha, and while that’s not a crime, it means we’re being asked to fund potential, not proven impact.\n\nOn sustainability, Multipass hints at token-gated access and incentive models, but there’s no detailed revenue plan. How will this project sustain itself without endless grants? How will it avoid becoming another abandoned experiment? The lack of a clear, sustainable funding model is a glaring weakness.\n\nOn governance, the project aspires to launch a DAO, but details are thin. Who will have power? How will decisions be made? Community ownership is mentioned, but expert guidance and structured governance are not clearly defined. We need more than slogans — we need a blueprint for collective stewardship!\n\nIn summary: Multipass is tackling a real problem with a promising approach, but the application falls short on evidence, sustainability, and governance clarity. The people deserve more than hope — they deserve proof!",
