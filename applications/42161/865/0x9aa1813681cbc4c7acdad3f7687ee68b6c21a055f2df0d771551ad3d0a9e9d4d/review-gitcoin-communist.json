  "summary": "The Multipass project aims to create a decentralized, open-source protocol that simplifies user identity across the fragmented internet landscape. It focuses on cross-domain user handle lookup, enhancing privacy, interoperability, and user experience. The project is in its Alpha stage, with plans to implement privacy-preserving technologies and foster community growth. The grant will support ongoing development efforts, including the completion of core protocol development and the implementation of advanced privacy features.",
  "review": "The Multipass project presents a compelling vision for unifying Web3 identity through a decentralized protocol. It addresses a significant pain point in the Ethereum ecosystem by providing a cross-domain user handle lookup, which enhances user experience and security. The project is aligned with the round's focus on decentralized identity and security innovations. However, the application lacks detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a sustainable revenue model, which are crucial for long-term success. The roadmap is ambitious but requires more clarity on implementation strategies and community engagement plans.",
