  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Multipass claims to be the vanguard of decentralized identity, promising to unify the fractured Web3 landscape. The project’s ambition is clear: a universal, open-source protocol for cross-domain identity lookup, managed as a decentralized organization on Ethereum. This is a noble cause—one that could empower users and dApps alike, breaking the chains of siloed identities and putting control back in the hands of the people.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by rhetoric! The application is heavy on vision, light on hard evidence. Where are the metrics? Where is the data showing real, measurable impact on the Ethereum network? The roadmap is outlined, but milestones lack specificity and quantifiable targets. The project is still in Alpha, and while there’s mention of active development, there’s little proof of sustainable traction or adoption. The promise of privacy enhancements and decentralized governance is exciting, but these are still on the horizon, not in the present.\n\nMultipass does align with open-source and ethical standards, and the team has a track record of participation in previous rounds. Yet, the application falls short on rigorous evaluation and transparent reporting. There’s talk of innovative financial models and token-gated access, but no clear plan for sustainable revenue or reduction of grant dependency. Community engagement is mentioned, but there’s no evidence of strong, structured governance or equitable benefit distribution.\n\nIn summary: Multipass is a project with revolutionary potential, but it must prove itself with hard evidence, clear metrics, and a sustainable, community-driven model. The Ethereum ecosystem deserves nothing less!",
