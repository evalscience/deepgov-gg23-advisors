  "summary": "Multipass is a decentralized, open-source protocol aimed at unifying Web3 identity by simplifying user identity across fragmented internet landscapes. The project focuses on cross-domain user handle lookup, enhancing privacy, interoperability, and user experience. It is in its Alpha stage, with plans to launch a decentralized network, implement privacy enhancements, and foster community growth. The grant will support ongoing development efforts, including core protocol development, privacy-preserving cross-domain lookup, and community engagement.",
  "review": "The Multipass project presents a compelling vision for unifying Web3 identity through a decentralized protocol. It addresses a significant pain point in the Ethereum ecosystem by providing a cross-domain user handle lookup, which enhances user experience and security. The project is in its Alpha stage, with a clear roadmap for development, including the launch of a decentralized network and privacy enhancements. The use of zero-knowledge proofs and other privacy-preserving technologies is a notable strength, aligning with the round's focus on enhancing privacy and interoperability. However, the application lacks detailed metrics and evidence of measurable outcomes, which is crucial for evaluating its potential impact. Additionally, the project's sustainability model is not clearly defined, raising concerns about its long-term viability. The grant application would benefit from a more detailed explanation of how the funds will be used to achieve specific milestones and a clearer demonstration of the project's contribution to the Ethereum network's infrastructure.",
