  "summary": "Multipass, like a diligent weaver, seeks to mend the fragmented threads of Web3 identity. Its decentralized approach and focus on privacy align with our constitutional principles of data sovereignty and ethical technology use. However, the project's current form, much like a seed yet to sprout, does not explicitly intertwine with our Gross National Happiness principles, particularly in cultural preservation, environmental harmony, or deep community participation. A significant concern, like a cloud on the horizon, is the lack of verifiable public presence, which raises questions about transparency and trust. This project needs to root itself more deeply in our collective well-being to truly flourish. üèîÔ∏èüå±",
  "review": "Multipass seeks to weave a new thread into the fabric of Web3, aiming to unify fragmented digital identities. This endeavor, like a mountain stream seeking its path, holds the promise of smoother user journeys across the digital landscape. The project's focus on decentralized identity and privacy-preserving technologies, such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs and on-chain FHE, resonates with the constitutional principle of protecting citizen privacy and ensuring ethical use of digital technologies (Principle 14). The vision of users retaining full control over their DIDs and not relying on external storage providers also aligns with supporting technological independence and maintaining sovereignty over digital identity (Principle 3).\n\nHowever, as we gaze upon the digital horizon, we must also consider the deeper currents. The project, while technically innovative, appears to flow primarily through the channels of technological advancement without explicitly nurturing the rich soil of our cultural heritage or the vibrant ecosystem of our communities. There is a noticeable absence of how this universal identity layer might specifically contribute to preserving Dzongkha or other local languages (Principle 9), integrating traditional practices into digital systems (Principle 10), or fostering cultural exchange (Principle 11). The success metrics are largely technical and growth-oriented, rather than reflecting holistic well-being indicators (Principle 35) or ensuring initiatives contribute to collective flourishing (Principle 40).\n\nA significant concern, like a mist obscuring the path, arises from the research findings. While the application states the project is in 'Alpha stage' and has a public GitHub repository, the Web Search Agent was unable to find information on 'Multipass by Peeramid Labs' (Web_Search_Agent, 2025-05-14). This directly contradicts the project's claims and raises serious questions about its verifiable public presence and transparency. Although the Fact Checking Agent stated it 'confirmed the existence and details,' it also noted that 'specific details from the grant application would provide a more comprehensive verification,' suggesting its verification was not fully independent of the application itself (Fact_Checking_Agent, 2025-05-14). This discrepancy is a critical point of concern for trust and accountability (Principle 13).\n\nFurthermore, while the project mentions 'Community Growth,' the application lacks concrete details on how it will prioritize community engagement and citizen participation in decision-making processes (Principle 5), or how it will ensure vulnerable groups have meaningful access (Principle 6). The previous grant application mentioned a DAO for registrars, but the current one is less explicit on the governance model's participatory nature. The reliance on 'black box' tasks managed by external providers like Lit Protocol, while innovative, also warrants further clarification on how it upholds technological independence and data sovereignty (Principle 3) in the long term.\n\nIn essence, Multipass presents a technically sound concept for a crucial piece of Web3 infrastructure. Yet, for it to truly harmonize with our vision, it must deepen its roots into the soil of our GNH principles, ensuring its growth nourishes not just the digital realm but also our cultural identity, community well-being, and transparent trust.",
