      "description": "# Multipass: Unifying Web3 Identity\n\nMultipass is building a decentralized, open-source protocol that simplifies user identity across the fragmented internet landscape. \n\nOur universal identity layer allows dApps and users to seamlessly lookup each other in simple and functional manner. \n\n![multipass-logo-512](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72625d2b-c195-4ee2-b278-5b27e6330625)\n\n## Problem\n\nIn the fragmented world of Web3, users are forced to manage multiple identities across different chains, applications, and social platforms. This leads to a cumbersome user experience, security risks, and hinders the growth of the decentralized ecosystem.\n\nThere are so many projects building complicated digital identity products that are focused on privacy. Yet for us it's just a \"[feature](https://github.com/peeramid-labs/multipass/milestone/1)\"\n\nThe real pain point we identified in ethereum UX is that we need a cross-domain user handle lookup! \n\n**With multipass dApps are able to answer following questions**\n- _\"What's `@Bob.telegram` handle on `discord`\"?_\n- _\"I just saw an activity by `0xdeadcafee...101` for my dApp, what's handle of user on `discord` ?_\n- _\"What's `@Bob.discord` wallet address?_\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a42e71ea-6e7d-47f8-9f30-1749e6293b46)\n\n## Use cases \n\n- **Enhanced dApp Notifications**: Tag users handles in platform they use!\n- **Cross platform social graph**: Build connections with users across different platforms.\n- **Improved Security:** Strengthen security with cross-platform verification and fraud prevention.\n- **Web2-to-Web3 Account Abstraction:** Enable Web2 logins for Web3 applications.\n- **Token-Gated Communities:**  Grant access based on verified identity and token ownership.\n\n## Project status\n\n\nMultipass is in its Alpha stage, with active development focused on:\n\n* **Decentralized Network:** Launching a robust and secure network of nodes.\n* **Privacy Enhancements:** Implementing zero-knowledge proofs and other privacy-preserving technologies.\n* **Developer Tools:** Creating SDKs and APIs for easy dApp integration.\n* **Community Growth:** Fostering a vibrant community of users and developers.\n\n## Grant Funding purpose  \n\n### Support ongoing development efforts \n\nThis grant will support Multipass in achieving these milestones:\n\n[Support work on v1.0.0 release milestone](https:/github.com/peeramid-labs/multipass/milestone/2): Complete core protocol development and launch it! ðŸš€\n\n[Privacy preserving cross domain lookup milestone](https://github.com/peeramid-labs/multipass/milestone/1): Implement advanced privacy features to protect user data.\n\n Community Growth:\n- Establish a dedicated support hub.\n- Develop comprehensive documentation and educational resources.\n- Increase project visibility through targeted outreach and community engagement.\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n### Development:\n* Number of issues resolved and pull requests merged.\n* Successful deployments to testnet and mainnet.\n* Completion of key milestones.\n### Community:\n* Growth of active users and developers.\n* Production of high-quality documentation and tutorials.\n* Positive community feedback and testimonials.\n* Increased engagement on social media and online forums.\n\n[Progress reporting: Karma GAP page](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/multipass)\n\n## Connect with Us\n\n* **Twitter:** [https://x.com/peeramid_labs](https://x.com/peeramid_labs)\n* **Discord:** [https://discord.gg/EddGgGUuWC](https://discord.gg/EddGgGUuWC)\n* **GitHub:** https://github.com/peeramid-labs/multipass ",
