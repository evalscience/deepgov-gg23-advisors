  "summary": "Multipass is a decentralized, open-source protocol aimed at simplifying user identity across the fragmented Web3 landscape. It seeks to unify user identities across different chains, applications, and social platforms, thereby enhancing user experience and security. The project is in its Alpha stage, focusing on launching a decentralized network, enhancing privacy, and fostering community growth. The grant will support ongoing development efforts, including the completion of core protocol development and the implementation of advanced privacy features.",
  "review": "The Multipass project presents a compelling solution to the fragmented identity management in the Web3 ecosystem. By focusing on cross-domain user handle lookup, it addresses a significant pain point in Ethereum's user experience. The project's emphasis on decentralization, privacy, and community growth aligns well with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure. However, the application lacks detailed metrics and evidence of past success, which are crucial for evaluating its potential impact. The roadmap is ambitious but needs more clarity on timelines and specific milestones. Additionally, while the project mentions leveraging existing protocols like Lit Protocol and ZKMail, it does not provide sufficient details on how these integrations will be achieved.",
