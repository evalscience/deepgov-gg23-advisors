  "summary": "Multipass is a decentralized, open-source protocol aimed at simplifying user identity across the fragmented Web3 landscape. It seeks to unify digital identities by providing a universal identity layer that allows decentralized applications (dApps) and users to seamlessly look up each other. The project addresses the problem of managing multiple identities across different chains and platforms, which can lead to a cumbersome user experience and security risks. Multipass is currently in its Alpha stage, focusing on launching a decentralized network, enhancing privacy, and developing tools for dApp integration. The grant will support ongoing development efforts, including the completion of core protocol development, implementation of privacy features, and community growth initiatives.",
  "review": "The Multipass project presents a compelling solution to the fragmented identity management issue in the Web3 ecosystem. By focusing on cross-domain user handle lookup, it addresses a significant pain point in Ethereum user experience. The project's emphasis on decentralization and privacy aligns well with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure. The use of zero-knowledge proofs and the development of a decentralized network demonstrate a commitment to enhancing privacy and security, which are crucial for the ecosystem's growth. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics and examples to substantiate its claims of significant contribution to the Ethereum network. Additionally, while the project is in its Alpha stage, a clearer timeline and more specific milestones would strengthen the roadmap. Overall, Multipass shows promise in contributing to the Ethereum ecosystem, but further clarity and detail in its plans and metrics are needed to fully assess its potential impact.",
