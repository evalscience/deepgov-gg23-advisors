  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the code: AIxScan is gunning for the heart of Ethereum’s infrastructure with an AI-powered, cross-chain explorer. That’s a big swing, and it’s got some serious potential for max utility. The project’s focus on human-readable, AI-generated transaction explanations is a major UX upgrade—no more squinting at raw hex dumps or deciphering contract spaghetti. That’s a win for onboarding the next wave of users and devs.\n\nCross-chain support? Check. That’s a big plus for the multi-chain future—Ethereum doesn’t live in a vacuum, and AIxScan’s ability to analyze Polygon, BSC, and more is a clear nod to interoperability. Security risk assessments and gas cost analysis are also strong value props, especially for DeFi degens and normies alike. The open-source ethos is present, and the roadmap is focused on scaling and integration (API/SDK), which aligns with the round’s long-term, systemic impact goals.\n\nBut let’s not get too bullish just yet. The app is light on hard metrics—no user numbers, transaction volumes, or adoption stats. There’s also a lack of detail on the AI models used, privacy implications, and how the platform handles sensitive data. The grant usage plan is a bit generic (\"LLM calls, UI, infra\"), and there’s no breakdown of costs or milestones. Plus, the deployer address section is blank, which is a red flag for transparency if smart contracts are involved.\n\nBottom line: AIxScan is swinging for the fences with a high-impact, scalable tool that could seriously level up Ethereum’s infra. But to unlock max funding, they need to ship more transparency, hard data, and specifics. Build in public, show your receipts, and let’s disrupt the system for real!",
