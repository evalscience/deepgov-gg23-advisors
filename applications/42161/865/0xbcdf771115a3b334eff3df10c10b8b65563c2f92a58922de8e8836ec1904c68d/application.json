One major issue in the Ethereum ecosystem is the complexity of transaction data. Traditional blockchain explorers often provide raw, technical data that is difficult for non-technical users to interpret. AIxScan solves this by leveraging AI to generate human-readable, intuitive explanations for Ethereum transactions, making it easier for users, whether developers or beginners, to understand contract interactions, token movements, and associated risks. Another challenge is the lack of cross-chain interoperability. Many blockchain explorers are limited to a single network, but AIxScan enables users to track Ethereum transactions alongside those from other blockchains like Polygon and Binance Smart Chain. This cross-chain support offers a unified interface for exploring multi-chain activities, making it especially valuable for users involved in DeFi, NFTs, or token swaps.
