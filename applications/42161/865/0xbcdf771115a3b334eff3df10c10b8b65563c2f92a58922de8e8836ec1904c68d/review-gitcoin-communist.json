  "summary": "AIxScan is an AI-powered blockchain explorer that enhances the Ethereum network by providing human-readable explanations for transactions, supporting cross-chain analysis, and evaluating smart contracts for risks. It aims to improve transparency, security, and cost-efficiency in Ethereum transactions. The project plans to use grant funds for LLM calls, platform optimization, UI improvements, and developing an API and SDK for integration with other applications.",
  "review": "AIxScan presents a compelling case for enhancing the Ethereum network's infrastructure through its AI-powered transaction analysis and cross-chain support. The project addresses significant challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as transaction complexity and lack of interoperability, by providing intuitive explanations and a unified interface for multi-chain activities. This aligns well with the round's focus on strengthening foundational infrastructure and pioneering development in interoperability and user experience. However, the application lacks specific metrics or evidence of measurable outcomes, which is crucial for evaluating its impact and sustainability. Additionally, the absence of deployer addresses raises concerns about transparency and accountability.",
