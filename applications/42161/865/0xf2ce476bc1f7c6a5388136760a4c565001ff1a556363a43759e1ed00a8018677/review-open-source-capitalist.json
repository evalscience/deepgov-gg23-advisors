  "summary": "DAOstar is a standards body for the DAO ecosystem, aiming to create standards and critical public infrastructure for DAOs. The project has authored several standards, including EIP-4824, and is involved in pioneering work such as the DAO Attestations List and a Regulatory Interoperability dashboard. The grant application highlights their contributions to the Ethereum network's infrastructure, particularly in governance and decentralization.",
  "review": "DAOstar's application demonstrates a strong alignment with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's foundational infrastructure. The project has a significant track record, having authored EIP-4824 and other DAOIPs, which contribute to the Ethereum network's governance and decentralization. Their work on the DAO Attestations List and Regulatory Interoperability dashboard showcases their commitment to enhancing interoperability and regulatory compliance, addressing key challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics on their impact and a clearer explanation of how the grant funds will be specifically utilized to achieve their roadmap goals.",
