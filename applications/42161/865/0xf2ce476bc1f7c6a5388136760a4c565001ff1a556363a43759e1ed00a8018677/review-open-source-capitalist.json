  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. DAOstar is swinging for the fences as the IETF of DAOs—think standards, not just for one protocol, but for the whole decentralized governance stack. That’s a big play for Ethereum’s backbone. They’re not just talking—they’ve shipped EIP-4824, DAOIP-3, DAOIP-5, and more, with real traction (co-authors from Gitcoin, integration with Allo V2, and a data lake that’s the biggest in Web3 grants). That’s serious infra cred.\n\nDAOstar’s focus is on interoperability, data standards, and regulatory bridges—root-level stuff that can scale across the entire ecosystem. Their roadmap is public, their code is open, and their impact is already visible in the wild. They’re not just theorizing; they’re building, and their standards are getting adopted by major DAOs and tooling projects. That’s max utility, high leverage, and long-term systemic change—exactly what this round is about.\n\nBut let’s not get too starry-eyed. The app is a bit light on hard metrics—where’s the usage data, adoption stats, or quantifiable impact? The roadmap link is external, not summarized in the app. And while they claim to be the standards body, there’s not much detail on governance, decision-making, or how they ensure broad adoption beyond their core group. For a project this ambitious, I want to see more transparency on process and more numbers to back up the narrative.\n\nBottom line: DAOstar is a high-impact, high-leverage bet for Ethereum infra. But to hit max score, they need to show the receipts—adoption metrics, usage stats, and a clearer breakdown of how funds will drive the next wave of standards. Build in public, but show your work!",
