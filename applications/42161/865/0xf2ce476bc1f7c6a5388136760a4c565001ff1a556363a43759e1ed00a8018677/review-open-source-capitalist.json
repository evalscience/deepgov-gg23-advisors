  "review": "Alright, let's plug into the DAOstar grant app and run a full diagnostic, Luna-style. This project is basically the IETF for DAOs—think standards, protocols, and public goods for the decentralized future. DAOstar’s track record is solid: EIP-4824, DAOIP-3/5/6, and a fat stack of research and data infrastructure. They’re not just building tools—they’re setting the rules of the game for DAOs, which is foundational for Ethereum’s long-term scalability and security.\n\nDAOstar’s outputs are high-leverage: standards like DAOIP-5 (co-authored with Gitcoin’s own Kevin Owocki) are already shaping the grants ecosystem. Their grants data lake is the biggest in Web3, and their upcoming releases (DAO Attestations List, Regulatory Interop Dashboard) are all about interoperability, transparency, and regulatory clarity. That’s max utility for the ecosystem—think root-cause fixes, not just band-aids.\n\nThe team’s got deep ecosystem buy-in (90+ orgs, every major DAO framework, and big DAOs like Lido). That’s serious network effect—if DAOstar sets a standard, the rest of the space follows. Their roadmap is public, their code is open, and their impact is global. They’re not just building for today—they’re laying rails for the next decade of DAO innovation.\n\nBut, let’s not sugarcoat it: the app could use more hard metrics and sharper clarity on how funds will be allocated. The roadmap link is helpful, but a breakdown of deliverables, timelines, and KPIs would make this a slam dunk. Also, more detail on privacy and security innovations would be nice—right now, it’s heavy on interoperability, lighter on privacy.\n\nBottom line: DAOstar is a high-impact, high-leverage bet for Ethereum infra. They’re building the standards that everyone else will use. But let’s get more granular on execution and impact tracking. Max utility, minimal fluff—let’s keep it tight!",
