  "summary": "DAOstar is a project focused on creating standards and public infrastructure for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). It is composed of over 90 key organizations and has authored several important standards, including EIP-4824. The project aims to enhance the Ethereum network's infrastructure by improving governance and decentralization within DAOs. DAOstar's roadmap includes developing a DAO Attestations List and a Regulatory Interoperability dashboard, which are expected to contribute to the long-term success of DAOs.",
  "review": "DAOstar presents a compelling case for its contribution to the Ethereum ecosystem. The project has a strong track record, having authored EIP-4824 and other DAOIPs, which are crucial for standardizing DAO operations. The project's focus on creating a DAO Attestations List and a Regulatory Interoperability dashboard aligns well with the round's goals of enhancing privacy, interoperability, and user experience. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics and examples of its impact on the Ethereum network. Additionally, while the project outlines a clear roadmap, it lacks specific timelines and milestones, which are important for assessing progress and accountability.",
