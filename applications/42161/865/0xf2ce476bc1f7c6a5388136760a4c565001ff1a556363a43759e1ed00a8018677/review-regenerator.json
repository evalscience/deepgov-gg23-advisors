  "review": "DAOstar presents a compelling case for its contribution to the Ethereum ecosystem. The project has a strong track record, having authored EIP-4824 and other DAOIPs, which are crucial for the development of DAOs. The application highlights its pioneering work in creating standards that enhance interoperability and governance within the DAO space. The project aligns well with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure, particularly in terms of governance and decentralization. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics and examples of its impact on the Ethereum network. Additionally, while the project mentions its roadmap, it lacks specific milestones and timelines, which are important for assessing progress and accountability.",
