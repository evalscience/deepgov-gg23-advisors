  "summary": "DAOstar is a project focused on creating standards and public infrastructure for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). It is composed of over 90 key organizations and has authored several standards, including EIP-4824 and DAOIP-5. The project aims to enhance the Ethereum network's infrastructure by improving governance and decentralization within DAOs. DAOstar's roadmap includes developing a DAO Attestations List and a Regulatory Interoperability dashboard. The grant funds will be used to support engineers, designers, and researchers on the DAOstar team.",
  "review": "DAOstar presents a compelling case for its contribution to the Ethereum ecosystem. The project has a strong track record of developing standards that enhance the interoperability and governance of DAOs, which are crucial for the decentralization and security of the Ethereum network. The application highlights significant achievements, such as the authorship of EIP-4824 and DAOIP-5, and outlines a clear roadmap for future developments. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics on the impact of its standards and a clearer explanation of how the grant funds will be specifically allocated. Additionally, while the project addresses governance and interoperability, it could further emphasize its contributions to privacy and user experience enhancements.",
