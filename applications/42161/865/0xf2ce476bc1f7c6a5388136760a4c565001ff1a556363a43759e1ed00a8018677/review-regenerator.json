  "summary": "DAOstar is a standards body for the DAO ecosystem, aiming to create standards and critical public infrastructure for DAOs. The project has authored several standards, including EIP-4824, and is involved in pioneering work such as the DAO Attestations List and a Regulatory Interoperability dashboard. The grant application highlights their contributions to the Ethereum network's infrastructure, particularly in governance and decentralization, and outlines a roadmap for future developments.",
  "review": "The DAOstar project presents a compelling case for its contribution to the Ethereum ecosystem. It has a strong track record of developing standards like EIP-4824 and DAOIP-5, which are crucial for the long-term success of DAO frameworks and tools. The project is well-aligned with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's foundational infrastructure, as it addresses governance and decentralization challenges. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics and examples of impact, as well as a clearer explanation of how the grant funds will be specifically allocated to achieve the outlined goals.",
