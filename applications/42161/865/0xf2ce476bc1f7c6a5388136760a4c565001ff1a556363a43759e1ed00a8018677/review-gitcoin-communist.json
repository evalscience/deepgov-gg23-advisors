  "summary": "DAOstar is a project focused on creating standards and public infrastructure for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). It is composed of over 90 key organizations in the DAO space and has authored several important standards, including EIP-4824. The project aims to enhance the Ethereum network's infrastructure by improving governance and decentralization within DAOs. DAOstar plans to use the grant funds to support engineers, designers, and researchers in achieving their development goals.",
  "review": "DAOstar presents a compelling case for its contribution to the Ethereum ecosystem. The project has a strong track record, having authored EIP-4824 and other DAOIPs, which are crucial for the development of DAOs. The application highlights their pioneering work in creating a grants data lake and developing standards that enhance interoperability and user experience. However, the application lacks specific metrics or data to quantify the impact of their contributions, which is essential for a data-driven evaluation. Additionally, while the project outlines a roadmap, it could benefit from more detailed milestones and timelines to better assess progress and sustainability. The project aligns well with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure, but it needs to provide more evidence of measurable outcomes and a sustainable revenue model.",
