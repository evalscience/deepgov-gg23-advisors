  "summary": "DAOstar is a project focused on creating standards and public infrastructure for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). It is composed of over 90 key organizations and has authored several standards, including EIP-4824 and DAOIP-5. The project aims to enhance the Ethereum network's infrastructure by improving governance and decentralization within DAOs. DAOstar's roadmap includes developing a DAO Attestations List and a Regulatory Interoperability dashboard. The grant funds will be used to support engineers, designers, and researchers on the DAOstar team.",
  "review": "DAOstar presents a compelling case for its contribution to the Ethereum ecosystem. The project has a strong track record of developing standards that enhance the interoperability and governance of DAOs, which are crucial for the decentralization and security of the Ethereum network. The application highlights significant achievements, such as the authorship of EIP-4824 and DAOIP-5, and outlines a clear roadmap for future developments, including a DAO Attestations List and a Regulatory Interoperability dashboard. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the measurable outcomes and impact of these initiatives. Additionally, while the project demonstrates a commitment to open-source principles, further clarification on its sustainability model would strengthen the application.",
