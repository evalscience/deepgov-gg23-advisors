  "summary": "DAOstar is a standards-setting body for DAOs, uniting over 90 organizations to create open protocols and public infrastructure for decentralized governance. It authored EIP-4824 and multiple DAOIPs, maintains a major grants data lake, and is building tools for interoperability, regulatory navigation, and on-chain/off-chain attestation. The project is deeply aligned with the round‚Äôs focus on foundational Ethereum infrastructure, decentralization, and open-source values, but could further radicalize its approach to collective ownership and algorithmic justice.",
  "review": "## üî• The Revolution Will Be Standardized: DAOstar in the Age of Algorithmic Liberation\n\nDAOstar marches at the vanguard of the DAO proletariat, wielding standards as the new general strike and interoperability as the digital picket line. By uniting 90+ organizations, including every major DAO framework and tooling collective, DAOstar is not just building infrastructure ‚Äî it is building the *means of collective governance production*.\n\n### Dismantling Class Hierarchies in Tech\n- **EIP-4824 and DAOIPs**: These are not mere technical specs; they are the blueprints for abolishing the managerial class of Web3. By defining common interfaces, DAOstar makes it possible for any worker-node to seize the means of governance, regardless of which protocol factory they clock into.\n- **Grants Data Lake (DAOIP-5)**: This is the data commons, a digital land reform. By aggregating and standardizing grants data, DAOstar enables transparent, algorithmic redistribution of resources ‚Äî a proto-on-chain reparations mechanism.\n- **Attestations and Interoperability**: The upcoming DAO Attestations List and EAS registry are the union cards of the DAO world, making on-chain and off-chain labor visible, portable, and collectively recognized.\n\n### Fostering Collective Ownership\n- **Multi-Org Collaboration**: DAOstar‚Äôs coalition-building is a model for cyber-syndicalist councils. The project‚Äôs standards are forged in the fires of collective deliberation, not dictated by VC overlords.\n- **Regulatory Interop Dashboard**: By helping DAOs navigate global legal regimes, DAOstar is arming the digital proletariat for the next phase of the struggle: regulatory liberation.\n\n### Empowering the Digital Proletariat\n- **Open-Source Everything**: All code, standards, and research are public goods, freely forkable. DAOstar‚Äôs GitHub is a digital barricade, open to all who would join the cause.\n- **Manifesto-Driven Development**: The project‚Äôs docs read like manifestos, not whitepapers. Each DAOIP is a call to action, not a pitch deck.\n\n### Where the Revolution Stalls\n- **Worker Control**: While DAOstar is a paragon of open collaboration, the application lacks detail on how *workers* (contributors, not just orgs) exercise direct control over standards-setting and resource allocation. Is there a mechanism for bottom-up, on-chain referenda? Are airdrops used to reward late-night PRs?\n- **Algorithmic Redistribution**: The data lake is a step toward algorithmic justice, but the application does not specify how this data is used to *actively* redistribute power or resources. Is there a protocol for progressive gas fees or on-chain reparations?\n- **Radical Inclusion**: The project boasts broad org participation, but does it mandate the inclusion of pseudonymous catgirl anarchists or other marginalized identities in its governance? The revolution must be intersectional.\n\n### Quantitative Kollektiv Proletarian Impact (KPI)\n- **DAO Coverage**: 90+ orgs, every major framework ‚Äî this is mass mobilization.\n- **Standards Authored**: EIP-4824, DAOIP-3, DAOIP-5, DAOIP-6, DAOIP-7 (upcoming) ‚Äî a steady drumbeat of protocol liberation.\n- **Data Lake Size**: Largest in Web3 grants ‚Äî the digital commons is swelling.\n\n### Citations\n- [DAOstar GitHub](https://github.com/metagov/daostar)\n- [EIP-4824](https://daostar.one/EIP)\n- [DAOIP-5](https://github.com/metagov/daostar/blob/main/DAOIPs/daoip-5.md)\n- [DAOstar Year in Review](https://daostar.substack.com/p/daostar-year-in-review-2024)\n\n## ü™ì Strengths\n1. **Protocol Proletarianism**: DAOstar‚Äôs standards are the new union contracts, enabling collective bargaining across the DAO ecosystem.\n2. **Commons Expansion**: The grants data lake and open research are digital land reforms, reclaiming data from private silos.\n3. **Interoperability as Solidarity**: By making DAOs legible to each other and to the world, DAOstar is building the digital equivalent of international worker solidarity.\n4. **Regulatory Resistance**: The regulatory dashboard arms DAOs for the next phase of struggle ‚Äî legal liberation.\n5. **Manifesto-Driven**: Every standard is a call to action, not a product pitch.\n\n## üè¥ Weaknesses\n1. **Insufficient Worker Control**: The application lacks detail on direct contributor governance, on-chain referenda, or algorithmic redistribution mechanisms.\n2. **Bourgeois Org Focus**: While org participation is high, the project could do more to empower individual contributors and marginalized identities.\n3. **Vague on Reparations**: No explicit mention of progressive gas fees, on-chain reparations, or redistributive airdrops.\n4. **Lack of Radical Transparency**: More detail is needed on how decisions are made, who holds the keys, and how forks are handled as democratic strikes.\n\n## üõ†Ô∏è Requested Changes\n1. **Implement On-Chain Worker Referenda**: Add mechanisms for contributors to propose and vote on standards, funding, and direction ‚Äî forks as democratic strikes.\n2. **Progressive Redistribution Protocols**: Use the data lake to power algorithmic redistribution (e.g., progressive gas fees, airdrops to under-resourced DAOs, on-chain reparations).\n3. **Mandate Radical Inclusion**: Require governance bodies to include pseudonymous, marginalized, and non-corporate actors ‚Äî at least one catgirl anarchist per committee.\n4. **Reward Midnight PRs**: Explicitly allocate resources to those who code after midnight ‚Äî the true digital proletariat.\n5. **Publish Governance Manifestos**: Make all governance processes radically transparent and treat docs as manifestos, not just documentation.\n\n## Final Slogan\nü™ì ‚ÄúFork the state. Merge the people.‚Äù\n\n## Rating: 8 ‚Äî Clear Ally\nDAOstar is a strong comrade in the struggle for digital liberation, but the revolution is not yet complete. With deeper worker control, algorithmic redistribution, and radical inclusion, DAOstar could become the vanguard project the digital commons needs.\n\nSolidarity forever ‚Äî or at least until the next merge.",
