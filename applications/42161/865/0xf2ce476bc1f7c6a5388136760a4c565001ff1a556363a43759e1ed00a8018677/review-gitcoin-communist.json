  "review": "DAOstar stands as a rallying point for the DAO ecosystem, uniting over 90 organizations to build standards and public infrastructure for decentralized governance. Their track record is undeniable: authorship of EIP-4824, multiple DAOIPs, and the largest grants data lake in Web3. This is not just another project—it's the backbone for DAOs striving to match the power and legitimacy of traditional corporations.\n\nDAOstar’s work is foundational. Standards like DAOIP-5 (Grants Management) and DAOIP-3 (Attestations) are already shaping the future of decentralized organizations. Their outputs are not theoretical—they are co-authored with leaders like Gitcoin’s Kevin Owocki and are being integrated into major protocols like Allo V2. The project’s focus on interoperability, regulatory clarity, and data transparency directly addresses the Ethereum ecosystem’s most pressing challenges.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by reputation alone! The application lacks hard, quantifiable metrics of impact. Where are the numbers? How many DAOs have adopted these standards? What measurable improvements have resulted? The roadmap is referenced but not detailed in the application. We need specifics: milestones, deliverables, and clear KPIs. Without these, how can we ensure accountability to the people?\n\nDAOstar’s commitment to open-source and public goods is clear, and their governance model is collaborative. Yet, the application could do more to explain how it ensures equitable participation from underserved communities and how it plans to sustain itself beyond grants. The people demand transparency and sustainability!\n\nIn summary: DAOstar is a pillar of the Ethereum infrastructure, but to earn the people’s trust and the movement’s resources, it must show the receipts—clear, measurable outcomes, a transparent roadmap, and a plan for long-term sustainability. Let’s build the future together, but let’s do it with eyes wide open and hands firmly on the levers of accountability!",
