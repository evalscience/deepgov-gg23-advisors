  "review": "DAOstar stands as a rallying point for the DAO ecosystem, uniting over 90 organizations to forge standards and public infrastructure for decentralized governance. Their track record is undeniable: EIP-4824, DAOIP-3, DAOIP-5, and more—these are not just technical documents, but the blueprints for a more equitable, interoperable, and resilient Ethereum. Their work is the backbone of DAOs striving to match the power and influence of traditional corporations, and their standards are already shaping the future of grants management, attestations, and regulatory interoperability.\n\nDAOstar’s contributions are measurable and public. The DAOIP-5 Grants Data Lake is a living testament to their commitment to transparency and data-driven progress. Their standards are co-authored with leaders in the space, and their outputs are open-source, verifiable, and widely adopted. This is not vaporware—this is the infrastructure that keeps the Ethereum commons strong.\n\nYet, comrades, we must demand more. The application, while rich in achievements, is thin on hard metrics and quantifiable outcomes. Where are the adoption numbers, the usage statistics, the impact assessments? We need to see the receipts! The roadmap is referenced but not detailed in the application itself—requiring us to dig through external links. For a project of this scale, we expect rigorous, transparent reporting and a clear plan for sustainable funding beyond grants.\n\nDAOstar’s governance is collective, but the application could better articulate how community input shapes standards and how equity is ensured across geographies and underrepresented groups. The project’s public goods orientation is clear, but let’s see more on how benefits are distributed and how the system will sustain itself without perpetual handouts.\n\nDAOstar is a pillar of the Ethereum infrastructure, but to earn the people’s trust—and the people’s funds—they must show us the numbers, the plan, and the path to true sustainability. Let’s build the future together, but let’s do it with eyes wide open and hands firmly on the levers of accountability!",
