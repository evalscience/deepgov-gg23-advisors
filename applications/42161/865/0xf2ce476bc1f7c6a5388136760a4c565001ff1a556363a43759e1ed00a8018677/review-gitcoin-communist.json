  "summary": "DAOstar is a project focused on creating standards and public infrastructure for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). It is composed of over 90 key organizations and has authored several standards, including EIP-4824 and DAOIP-5. The project aims to enhance the Ethereum network's infrastructure by improving governance and decentralization within DAOs. The grant funds will be used to support engineers, designers, and researchers on the DAOstar team.",
  "review": "DAOstar presents a compelling case for its contribution to the Ethereum ecosystem. The project has a strong track record of developing standards that enhance interoperability and governance within DAOs, which are crucial for the decentralization and security of the Ethereum network. The application highlights significant achievements, such as the authorship of EIP-4824 and DAOIP-5, and outlines a clear roadmap for future developments. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics and evidence of impact to align with the Evidence and Measurement Principles outlined in the model specification. Additionally, while the project demonstrates a commitment to community governance, it should provide more information on how it ensures geographic equity and considers underserved populations.",
