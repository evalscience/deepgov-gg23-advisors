  "summary": "DAOstar, as a standards body for DAOs, demonstrates strong alignment with principles of decentralized and transparent governance (Principles 8, 13) by developing crucial interoperability standards like EIP-4824. While its technical contributions to Web3 infrastructure are significant and globally impactful, the application lacks explicit details on how these efforts directly contribute to community well-being, cultural preservation, or environmental sustainability, which are core to Gross National Happiness principles (Principles 4, 39, 40). The project's focus on making DAOs 'as powerful as traditional corporations' needs further contextualization to ensure it harmonizes with holistic development rather than purely economic advancement.",
  "review": "DAOstar presents itself as a crucial standards body for the DAO ecosystem, akin to the IETF, with a clear mission to enhance interoperability and governance within decentralized autonomous organizations. The project has a strong track record, evidenced by its authorship of EIP-4824 and numerous DAOIPs (DAOIP-2, DAOIP-3, DAOIP-5, DAOIP-6), and its involvement in maintaining a significant grants data lake. This foundational work is vital for the broader Web3 infrastructure, contributing to more robust and transparent decentralized systems.\n\nFrom the perspective of Gross National Happiness (GNH) principles, DAOstar's focus on creating open standards for DAOs inherently supports transparent and accountable governance (Principle 13) by providing common interfaces and data structures. The emphasis on decentralization within DAOs also resonates with the principle of supporting decentralized approaches that respect local autonomy (Principle 8). The project's engagement in regulatory interoperability and its co-authorship of DAOIP-5 with Gitcoin demonstrate a commitment to engaging with global best practices (Principle 12) and fostering collaboration within the ecosystem.\n\nHowever, the application's primary focus remains largely technical and organizational, aiming to make DAOs 'as powerful as traditional corporations.' While this can lead to efficiency and growth, it does not explicitly articulate how this power will be channeled to directly enhance community well-being, preserve cultural heritage, or ensure environmental sustainabilityâ€”core tenets of GNH. The project's global scope, while valuable, means its direct impact on specific local communities, such as those in Bhutan, is not clearly defined. There is a notable absence of detail on how DAOstar's work would integrate with traditional wisdom (Principle 2), ensure meaningful access for vulnerable groups (Principle 6), or foster local ownership (Principle 7) beyond the general concept of decentralization. The proposed use of funds for engineers, designers, and researchers is standard, but the roadmap, while linked, does not provide specific GNH-aligned milestones or metrics beyond technical development. To fully align with Bhutan's vision, the project would benefit from a more explicit connection between its technical standards and their potential for holistic societal benefit.",

  "reasoning": "DAOstar's work on standardizing DAOs aligns well with principles of decentralized approaches (Principle 8) and transparent, accountable governance (Principle 13). Its efforts to enhance interoperability and engage with global best practices (Principle 12) are also commendable. However, the application lacks explicit articulation of how the project directly contributes to cultural preservation (Principles 9, 10, 11), environmental sustainability (Principles 17, 18, 19), or the specific well-being of vulnerable groups (Principle 6). The connection to fostering local ownership (Principle 7) and integrating traditional wisdom (Principle 2) is not clearly demonstrated. Furthermore, the project's broad goal of making DAOs 'as powerful as traditional corporations' needs to be carefully harmonized with environmental and community well-being (Principle 4) and explicitly aligned with Gross National Happiness principles (Principles 39, 40) to ensure collective flourishing over purely economic indicators (Principle 15, 35).",
