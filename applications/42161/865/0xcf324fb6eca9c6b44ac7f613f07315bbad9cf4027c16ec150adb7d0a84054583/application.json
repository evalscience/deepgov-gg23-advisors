As a specialized zkRollup, DAVINCI:\n— Processes high-frequency, low-cost voting off-chain.\n— Publishes succinct zkSNARK proofs and EIP-4844 blobs for data availability on Ethereum L1.\n— Maintains full trustlessness and auditability while dramatically reducing gas costs.\n\n_Example: A voting process with 10,000 participants generates only a single proof and data blob, reducing on-chain footprint by ~99% compared to direct on-chain voting._\n\n# Infrastructure for trustless and universal voting\n\nDAVINCI provides:\n— **A robust Merkle-based state machine**, where the full voting process state (including encrypted vote accumulators, nullifiers, and voter commitments) is updated off-chain and anchored on-chain via smart contracts.\n— **zkSNARK circuits that prove the correctness of both individual votes and state transitions**, ensuring tamper-proof execution without revealing private data.\n— **A sequencer network** that operates on staked collateral, with rewards/slashing to ensure reliability.\n\nThis creates a **plug-and-play infrastructure layer for any Ethereum-based app that needs secure, anonymous, and verifiable voting**.\n\n_More than 300 organizations (including DAOs, associations, and city councils) have used Vocdoni’s earlier stack. DAVINCI upgrades this to a fully decentralized L2 aligned with Ethereum._\n\n# Native Ethereum interoperability\n\nDAVINCI is **deeply embedded in Ethereum’s stack**:\n— **Uses Ethereum smart contracts** for all process registration, proof verification, and state updates.\n— **Aligns with EIP-4844**, contributing to the demand and use of Ethereum’s proto-danksharding architecture.\n\nBy design, DAVINCI helps stress-test and utilize Ethereum’s latest scalability primitives, accelerating adoption of zk-based systems.",

        "description": "**TL;DR:** Vocdoni leads the way in opensource **decentralized voting technology, with hundreds of thousands of votes processed for +300 organizations**, including City councils, Political parties, Cooperatives, Football clubs, Associations, opposition groups under repressive regimes and more! We accomplished this using a custom L1 blockchain designed specifically for voting. **Now, we are building DAVINCI, a new public good voting protocol** that ensures anonymous, anticoercion, verifiable, and accessible elections using zkSNARKs and Homomorphic Encryption. **DAVINCI is the first solution that meets all the criteria for a universal voting protocol, covering a wide range of use cases: from gasless and anonymous offchain voting for DAOs, with the same guarantees as onchain voting, to national-level official elections.**\n\n---\n\n## Introducing DAVINCI: The future of voting on Ethereum\n\n**Modern voting systems (whether paper-based, centralized digital voting, or onchain) suffer from significant flaws**, including high costs, limited accessibility, and vulnerabilities to manipulation, bias, and vote buying. Achieving the highest standards of election security and fairness remains costly and complex, leaving billions without a secure digital participation option. **Recurrent, low-cost voting is crucial for democratic resilience, but the existing systems lack the necessary technological infrastructure to support it**.\n\n### **What is DAVINCI?**\n\n**DAVINCI** (Decentralized Autonomous Voting Infrastructure for Non-Coercive Inclusion) is a new neutral and unstoppable voting protocol designed for **privacy, scalability, and security**. It enables **high-frequency, low-cost elections** while ensuring transparency, censorship resistance, anti-coercion, and integrity.\n\nBuilt as a **Layer 2 solution on Ethereum**, DAVINCI ensures votes remain **tamper-proof and trustless**, eliminating central points of failure.\n\n### **How DAVINCI Works**\n\nDAVINCI leverages **zkSNARKs and threshold homomorphic encryption (ElGamal)** to provide **end-to-end verifiability, anticoercion and anonymity**, allowing voters to participate **without compromising privacy**.\n\nA **distributed key generation (DKG) system**, coordinated via smart contracts, secures encryption key creation while preventing manipulation. This ensures **trustless election integrity** without relying on any single entity.\n\n### **Technology & Implementation**\n\n- **Privacy-Preserving Voting:** Utilizes **zkSNARKs** for secure, anonymous voting with **on-chain verifiability**.\n- **Scalable & Efficient:** Implements **Gnark cryptographic libraries** using **BLS12-377 & BW6-761 curves** for **fast recursive vote aggregation**.\n- **Ethereum Integration:** Produces **BN254 proofs**, ensuring vote validity **onchain** with minimal computational overhead.\n- **Accessible & Decentralized:** Designed to run on **widely accessible hardware (64 GiB RAM)**, making it easy for anyone to join the sequencer network without requiring specialized infrastructure.\n- **Flexible & Gasless:** Supports **various governance models**, including **DAO voting, national elections, and community polls**, with an efficient **off-chain computation model**.\n\n### **Why DAVINCI?**\n\nDAVINCI is the **only** voting protocol that outperforms **paper-based, centralized digital, and onchain voting**. It meets the requirements for a **universal voting solution**.\n\n![DAVINCI Protocol Comparison](https://tomato-giant-grasshopper-196.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeihp67w6hzoog2e2ufgn44wqpin7i7l54wvin2sew2xxa3f36n3giu)\n\n### **Roadmap & Next Steps**\n\n![DAVINCI Roadmap](https://tomato-giant-grasshopper-196.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafkreigqsitln2filgaid2s2kzmjorwxkamjs2bdfxjr4zcnqyauj3wiyy)\n\nDAVINCI has completed its **proof-of-concept** phase and is now moving towards a **testnet launch in Q2 2025**. Our next milestones include:\n\n- **Testnet launch with a single sequencer**\n- **Audits**\n- **User Testing & Pilots**\n- **Migration of current users of the Vocdoni protocol to DAVINCI**\n- **Community building around DAVINCI**\n- **Mainnet Deployment**\n\nTo achieve these milestones, we need funds to cover our running costs.\n\n### Extended info & repos:\n\n- [Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.vocdoni.io/)\n- [Ethresearch thread](https://ethresear.ch/t/vocdoni-protocol-enabling-decentralized-voting-for-the-masses-with-zk-technology/21036)\n- Success stories:\n    - [New Belarus](https://blog.vocdoni.io/new-belarus-vocdoni)\n    - [Football Club Barcelona](https://thefintechtimes.com/fc-barcelona-reaches-milestone-in-blockchain-tech-adoption-immortalising-johan-cruyff/)\n    - [First official digital referendum in Spain](https://blog.vocdoni.io/referendum-bellpuig)\n    - [One of the biggest political parties in Spain](https://x.com/vocdoni/status/1868017937212162093)\n- All our code is opensource and we build in public, you can visit our github repositories here:\n    - https://github.com/vocdoni/vocdoni-circuits-artifacts\n    - https://github.com/vocdoni/circom2gnark\n    - https://github.com/vocdoni/davinci-node\n    - https://github.com/vocdoni/contracts-z\n    - https://github.com/vocdoni/gnark-crypto-primitives\n\n### **Get Involved**\n\nWe’re building DAVINCI as an **open-source and neutral protocol** and invite the Ethereum and governance communities to contribute. Whether you’re a developer, researcher, or advocate for democratic resilience, your support will help make **secure, censorship-resistant voting a reality!**\n\n**Contribute on GitHub →** [github.com/vocdoni](https://github.com/vocdoni/)\n\n**Vocdoni Discord server →** [chat.vocdoni.io](https://chat.vocdoni.io/)\n\n**DAVINCI→** [davinci.vote](https://davinci.vote/)",

      "description": "**TL;DR:** Vocdoni leads the way in opensource **decentralized voting technology, with hundreds of thousands of votes processed for +300 organizations**, including City councils, Political parties, Cooperatives, Football clubs, Associations, opposition groups under repressive regimes and more! We accomplished this using a custom L1 blockchain designed specifically for voting. **Now, we are building DAVINCI, a new public good voting protocol** that ensures anonymous, anticoercion, verifiable, and accessible elections using zkSNARKs and Homomorphic Encryption. **DAVINCI is the first solution that meets all the criteria for a universal voting protocol, covering a wide range of use cases: from gasless and anonymous offchain voting for DAOs, with the same guarantees as onchain voting, to national-level official elections.**\n\n---\n\n## Introducing DAVINCI: The future of voting on Ethereum\n\n**Modern voting systems (whether paper-based, centralized digital voting, or onchain) suffer from significant flaws**, including high costs, limited accessibility, and vulnerabilities to manipulation, bias, and vote buying. Achieving the highest standards of election security and fairness remains costly and complex, leaving billions without a secure digital participation option. **Recurrent, low-cost voting is crucial for democratic resilience, but the existing systems lack the necessary technological infrastructure to support it**.\n\n### **What is DAVINCI?**\n\n**DAVINCI** (Decentralized Autonomous Voting Infrastructure for Non-Coercive Inclusion) is a new neutral and unstoppable voting protocol designed for **privacy, scalability, and security**. It enables **high-frequency, low-cost elections** while ensuring transparency, censorship resistance, anti-coercion, and integrity.\n\nBuilt as a **Layer 2 solution on Ethereum**, DAVINCI ensures votes remain **tamper-proof and trustless**, eliminating central points of failure.\n\n### **How DAVINCI Works**\n\nDAVINCI leverages **zkSNARKs and threshold homomorphic encryption (ElGamal)** to provide **end-to-end verifiability, anticoercion and anonymity**, allowing voters to participate **without compromising privacy**.\n\nA **distributed key generation (DKG) system**, coordinated via smart contracts, secures encryption key creation while preventing manipulation. This ensures **trustless election integrity** without relying on any single entity.\n\n### **Technology & Implementation**\n\n- **Privacy-Preserving Voting:** Utilizes **zkSNARKs** for secure, anonymous voting with **on-chain verifiability**.\n- **Scalable & Efficient:** Implements **Gnark cryptographic libraries** using **BLS12-377 & BW6-761 curves** for **fast recursive vote aggregation**.\n- **Ethereum Integration:** Produces **BN254 proofs**, ensuring vote validity **onchain** with minimal computational overhead.\n- **Accessible & Decentralized:** Designed to run on **widely accessible hardware (64 GiB RAM)**, making it easy for anyone to join the sequencer network without requiring specialized infrastructure.\n- **Flexible & Gasless:** Supports **various governance models**, including **DAO voting, national elections, and community polls**, with an efficient **off-chain computation model**.\n\n### **Why DAVINCI?**\n\nDAVINCI is the **only** voting protocol that outperforms **paper-based, centralized digital, and onchain voting**. It meets the requirements for a **universal voting solution**.\n\n![DAVINCI Protocol Comparison](https://tomato-giant-grasshopper-196.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeihp67w6hzoog2e2ufgn44wqpin7i7l54wvin2sew2xxa3f36n3giu)\n\n### **Roadmap & Next Steps**\n\n![DAVINCI Roadmap](https://tomato-giant-grasshopper-196.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafkreigqsitln2filgaid2s2kzmjorwxkamjs2bdfxjr4zcnqyauj3wiyy)\n\nDAVINCI has completed its **proof-of-concept** phase and is now moving towards a **testnet launch in Q2 2025**. Our next milestones include:\n\n- **Testnet launch with a single sequencer**\n- **Audits**\n- **User Testing & Pilots**\n- **Migration of current users of the Vocdoni protocol to DAVINCI**\n- **Community building around DAVINCI**\n- **Mainnet Deployment**\n\nTo achieve these milestones, we need funds to cover our running costs.\n\n### Extended info & repos:\n\n- [Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.vocdoni.io/)\n- [Ethresearch thread](https://ethresear.ch/t/vocdoni-protocol-enabling-decentralized-voting-for-the-masses-with-zk-technology/21036)\n- Success stories:\n    - [New Belarus](https://blog.vocdoni.io/new-belarus-vocdoni)\n    - [Football Club Barcelona](https://thefintechtimes.com/fc-barcelona-reaches-milestone-in-blockchain-tech-adoption-immortalising-johan-cruyff/)\n    - [First official digital referendum in Spain](https://blog.vocdoni.io/referendum-bellpuig)\n    - [One of the biggest political parties in Spain](https://x.com/vocdoni/status/1868017937212162093)\n- All our code is opensource and we build in public, you can visit our github repositories here:\n    - https://github.com/vocdoni/vocdoni-circuits-artifacts\n    - https://github.com/vocdoni/circom2gnark\n    - https://github.com/vocdoni/davinci-node\n    - https://github.com/vocdoni/contracts-z\n    - https://github.com/vocdoni/gnark-crypto-primitives\n\n### **Get Involved**\n\nWe’re building DAVINCI as an **open-source and neutral protocol** and invite the Ethereum and governance communities to contribute. Whether you’re a developer, researcher, or advocate for democratic resilience, your support will help make **secure, censorship-resistant voting a reality!**\n\n**Contribute on GitHub →** [github.com/vocdoni](https://github.com/vocdoni/)\n\n**Vocdoni Discord server →** [chat.vocdoni.io](https://chat.vocdoni.io/)\n\n**DAVINCI→** [davinci.vote](https://davinci.vote/)",
