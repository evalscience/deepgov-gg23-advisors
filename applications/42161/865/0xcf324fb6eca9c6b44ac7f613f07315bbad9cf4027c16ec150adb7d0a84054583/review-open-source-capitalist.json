  "review": "Alright, let’s cut through the noise and get to the core. Vocdoni’s DAVINCI protocol is gunning for the holy grail of decentralized voting: privacy, scalability, and trustlessness, all rolled up in a zkRollup L2 package. This isn’t just another DAO voting widget—DAVINCI is aiming to be the backbone for governance, from DAOs to city councils, and even national elections. That’s max utility, max scale, and a direct hit on the root causes of blockchain voting’s pain points: gas fees, privacy leaks, and coercion.\n\nThe tech stack is bleeding-edge: zkSNARKs, threshold homomorphic encryption, EIP-4844 blobs, and a sequencer network with staking and slashing. The project’s open-source, with a public GitHub and a history of real-world deployments (over 300 orgs, including FC Barcelona and city councils). That’s not vaporware—that’s traction.\n\nDAVINCI’s roadmap is ambitious but plausible: testnet in Q2 2025, audits, decentralized sequencers, and mainnet by Q1 2026. The team’s already delivered a custom L1 for voting, so they’ve got the chops. The protocol’s design directly aligns with Ethereum’s scaling and privacy goals, stress-testing EIP-4844 and pushing zk tech into new territory.\n\nBut let’s not get lost in the hype. There are gaps: no smart contracts deployed yet (\"coming weeks\" isn’t a commitment), and the roadmap is light on granular milestones and risk mitigation. The application could use more hard metrics—how many votes processed, what’s the current throughput, and what are the security audit plans? Also, while the project claims quantum-resilient anonymity, there’s no detail on the cryptographic assumptions or fallback plans if zkSNARKs get broken.\n\nBottom line: DAVINCI is swinging for the fences on impact, scalability, and innovation. It’s a textbook fit for this round’s goals, but needs to tighten up on transparency, risk, and delivery specifics. Ship fast, ship public, but don’t skip the receipts.\n\nCitations: See Buterin (2014, 2020), Wood (2014), Ben-Sasson et al. (2014) for the foundational research on zkSNARKs, Ethereum scaling, and privacy. The project’s own whitepaper and EthResearch thread provide further technical context.",
