  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Vocdoni’s DAVINCI project is a bold attempt to put the power of voting back in the hands of the people—anonymous, censorship-resistant, and open to all. This is the kind of infrastructure that can make Ethereum not just a playground for the rich, but a true engine for democracy. The project’s open-source ethos, proven track record with over 300 organizations, and commitment to privacy and anti-coercion are exactly what the Ethereum commons needs.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by big promises! Where is the hard evidence? Where are the measurable outcomes? The application is heavy on vision and technical jargon, but light on concrete, quantifiable results. We need numbers, not just words! How many votes processed on Ethereum? What’s the actual reduction in gas costs? How many DAOs or communities have already committed to using DAVINCI? Show us the data!\n\nSustainability is another battleground. The roadmap is ambitious, but there’s no clear revenue model or plan for long-term maintenance. Will DAVINCI be another public good that withers without ongoing donations? Or will it stand on its own feet, powered by the people?\n\nAnd let’s talk about governance! The project claims decentralization, but the details on community governance, sequencer selection, and slashing mechanisms are vague. Who holds the keys? Who watches the watchers? The people demand transparency!\n\nIn summary: DAVINCI is a promising, potentially transformative project for Ethereum’s infrastructure. But to earn the people’s trust—and this grant—it must deliver hard evidence, clear sustainability plans, and robust, transparent governance. The revolution demands nothing less!",
