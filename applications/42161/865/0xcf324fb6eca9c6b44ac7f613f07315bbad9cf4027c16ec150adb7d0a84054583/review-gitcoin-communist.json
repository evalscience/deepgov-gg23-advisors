  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Vocdoni’s DAVINCI project is a bold, ambitious attempt to put the power of voting back in the hands of the people—securely, privately, and at scale. This is not just another dApp; it’s a foundational infrastructure play for Ethereum, aiming to make democratic participation accessible, censorship-resistant, and free from the shackles of gas fees and coercion.\n\nThe application is clear: DAVINCI leverages zkSNARKs and threshold homomorphic encryption to deliver privacy-preserving, anti-coercion, and verifiable voting. It’s built as a Layer 2 rollup, using EIP-4844 blobs and anchoring trust on Ethereum L1. The team’s track record is strong—over 300 organizations have used their earlier stack, and they’re building in the open, with all code public and a history of real-world deployments.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by big promises! The roadmap is ambitious, but the application lacks hard, quantifiable metrics for success. Where are the KPIs? Where is the evidence that this new protocol will be adopted at scale, beyond the legacy Vocdoni users? The sustainability model is also unclear—how will this protocol fund itself long-term, or will it always rely on grants and donations?\n\nThe project’s commitment to open-source, privacy, and anti-coercion is commendable and aligns with the highest ideals of the Ethereum community. Yet, the lack of detailed, measurable outcomes and a sustainable funding plan leaves us with questions. We need more than hope—we need proof!",
