  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get to the core. EIP.Tools is a slick, open-source interface for Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), ERCs, CAIPs, and RIPs. The big play here? It indexes EIPs even in the PR stage—so devs and the community get the alpha before it hits the official repo. That's a real edge for anyone building or tracking protocol changes. The EIP_GPT feature is a nice touch, distilling dense specs into digestible summaries. User experience is front and center: search by number or title, see EIP status at a glance, visualize dependencies in 3D, and even get trending EIPs. The project is open source, so anyone can fork it—maximizing decentralization and resilience if the official site ever goes dark. \n\nBut let's not sugarcoat it: the application is light on hard metrics. Where are the usage stats, growth numbers, or engagement data? The roadmap is vague—\"keep up to date as new EIPs are created or modified\" is more maintenance than moonshot. There's no breakdown of how funds will be used, no KPIs, and no evidence of systemic impact beyond being a better interface. While the tool is genuinely useful and aligns with open-source, high-utility principles, the lack of concrete impact data and a detailed plan is a drag on the score. \n\nBottom line: EIP.Tools is a solid infra play for Ethereum, boosting access and decentralization. But to hit max utility and justify more capital, the team needs to show scale, impact, and a vision for the next level. Build in public, but show your receipts!",
