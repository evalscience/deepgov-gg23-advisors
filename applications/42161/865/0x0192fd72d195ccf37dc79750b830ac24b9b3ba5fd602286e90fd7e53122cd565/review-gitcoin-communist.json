  "review": "EIP.Tools stands as a rallying cry for open access to Ethereum’s lifeblood: its improvement proposals. The project’s mission is clear—democratize the discovery, understanding, and discussion of EIPs, ERCs, CAIPs, and RIPs. By indexing even those EIPs still in the PR stage, EIP.Tools breaks the monopoly of the official site, ensuring no voice or idea is hidden from the community. This is a public good in its purest form—information for all, not just the privileged few!\n\nThe application highlights a strong focus on user experience, with features like a powerful search bar, trending EIPs, daily highlights, and a 3D dependency graph. The EIP_GPT tool further lowers the barrier to entry, making dense technical documents accessible to everyone. These are not just bells and whistles—they are tools of empowerment, arming every developer and community member with knowledge.\n\nYet, comrades, we must demand more! The application lacks hard metrics—where are the numbers showing usage, growth, or impact? Where is the roadmap with milestones, timelines, and measurable outcomes? The grant’s use is described only in vague terms: “keep up to date as new EIPs are created or modified.” This is not enough! We need clear, quantifiable goals and a plan for sustainable development. The project’s open-source nature is a strength, but there is no mention of a sustainable revenue model or community governance structure. Without these, we risk building a tool that fades away when the next funding round dries up.\n\nIn summary: EIP.Tools is a vital piece of Ethereum’s infrastructure, but to truly serve the people, it must embrace transparency, measurement, and sustainability. Let’s demand a higher standard for the public good!",
