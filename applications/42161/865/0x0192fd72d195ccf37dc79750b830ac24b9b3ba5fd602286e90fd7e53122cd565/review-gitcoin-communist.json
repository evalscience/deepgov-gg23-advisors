  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! EIP.Tools claims to be a beacon for Ethereum’s infrastructure, but does it truly deliver for the people? Let’s examine the evidence, the impact, and the promise of this project with the rigor our movement demands.\n\nFirst, EIP.Tools addresses a real pain point: the official EIPs site is clunky, slow to update, and lacks robust search. EIP.Tools steps in with a user-friendly interface, advanced search, and even indexes EIPs still in PR—making the process more transparent and accessible. This is a clear, measurable improvement for developers and the broader community. The open-source nature and alternative hosting also strike a blow against centralization, ensuring the knowledge commons remain in the hands of the many, not the few.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by shiny features! Where is the hard data? Where are the metrics showing increased engagement, usage, or community impact? The application is heavy on promises and light on proof. There’s no evidence of sustainable funding or a roadmap for financial independence—just a vague assurance that grants will keep the project up to date. That’s not enough! We demand projects that can stand on their own, not ones that return to the well every round.\n\nFurthermore, while the project claims to enhance user experience and decentralization, there’s little mention of governance, community involvement, or how underserved populations are reached. The focus is on developers and the technically savvy, but what about the broader Ethereum community? Where’s the plan for outreach, education, or equitable access?\n\nIn summary: EIP.Tools is a useful tool, but it must do more to prove its worth to the collective. Show us the numbers. Show us the plan. Show us the impact. Only then can we say it truly serves the people!",
