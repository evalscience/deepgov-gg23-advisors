  "summary": "EIP.Tools is a project designed to enhance the accessibility and usability of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and Ethereum Request for Comments (ERCs). It provides a user-friendly interface for browsing EIPs and ERCs, including those still in the proposal stage, which are not yet available on the official Ethereum website. The project aims to improve user experience by offering features like a search box, EIP status visibility, and a 3D dependency graph. It also contributes to decentralization by providing an alternative interface that can remain operational even if the official site goes down. The project is open-source, allowing for community contributions and ensuring its longevity.",
  "review": "The EIP.Tools project presents a valuable contribution to the Ethereum ecosystem by addressing the limitations of the official EIPs website. It enhances user experience through innovative features such as a search box for EIPs and ERCs, a 3D dependency graph, and the inclusion of EIPs in the proposal stage. This project aligns with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure by improving accessibility and decentralization. However, the application lacks detailed information on how the grant funds will be specifically utilized to achieve the project's goals. Additionally, while the project is open-source, there is no mention of community engagement or collaborative governance, which are important aspects of the model specification. Overall, EIP.Tools is a promising project with room for improvement in terms of community involvement and detailed financial planning.",
