  "summary": "EIP.Tools is a project designed to enhance the accessibility and usability of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and Ethereum Request for Comments (ERCs). It provides a user-friendly interface for browsing EIPs, including those in the proposal stage, which are not yet available on the official Ethereum website. The project aims to improve user experience by offering features like a search bar, EIP status visibility, and a 3D dependency graph. It also contributes to decentralization by providing an alternative platform for accessing EIP information.",
  "review": "The EIP.Tools project presents a valuable contribution to the Ethereum ecosystem by addressing the limitations of the official EIPs website. It enhances user experience through improved search functionality and visualization tools, such as the 3D dependency graph. The project's open-source nature aligns with the principles of decentralization and community participation, allowing for continuous development and adaptation by the community. However, the application lacks detailed information on how the grant funds will be specifically utilized to achieve the project's goals, which is crucial for assessing the project's potential impact and sustainability.",
