  "review": "Alright, let’s cut through the noise and get to the alpha. Pairwise is a battle-tested, open-source voting tool that’s already shipped real impact in the Ethereum ecosystem—think Optimism RetroFunding, Deep Funding with Vitalik, and a UX that’s more Tinder than tedious governance portal. This isn’t just another governance dApp; it’s a capital allocation engine that’s already distributed over 50 million OP to 1,000+ projects, with 900+ stakeholders in the mix. That’s serious scale and real-world traction—exactly what we want for max utility.\n\nOn the innovation front, Pairwise is flexing hard: liquid democracy, pseudo-anonymous voting, and seamless delegation via X and Farcaster. The project’s not just talking about privacy and UX—they’re shipping it. The integration of ZK proofs and account abstraction wallets is bleeding-edge, and the focus on minimizing voter apathy is a direct hit on a root cause of governance stagnation. That’s long-term, systemic thinking.\n\nBut let’s not get too bullish without a little FUD-check. The roadmap is a bit light on specifics—\"continue developing components\" and \"build a self-service platform\" is vague. Where’s the breakdown? What’s the timeline? How do we know the next round of funds won’t just get lost in the dev ether? Also, while the impact on Optimism is clear, the direct, measurable impact on Ethereum’s core infra (beyond governance tooling) could use more receipts. Show us the metrics, not just the vibes.\n\nBottom line: Pairwise is a high-leverage, scalable play for decentralized capital allocation and governance. It’s got the track record, the tech, and the vision. But to hit max score, we need more granular milestones and harder data on Ethereum infra impact. Build in public, but show your receipts!",
