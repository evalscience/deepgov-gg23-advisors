  "summary": "Pairwise is an innovative voting tool designed to enhance governance within the Ethereum ecosystem by providing a simple, fair, and engaging way for multiple stakeholders to make decisions. The project has been utilized in several RetroFunding rounds, demonstrating its impact on distributing significant funds to numerous projects. Pairwise aims to address issues like centralized capital allocation and voter apathy by offering a decentralized, customizable voting experience. The project also integrates privacy features and supports liquid democracy, making it a versatile tool for community engagement and decision-making.",
  "review": "The Pairwise project presents a compelling case for enhancing governance within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its use in distributing over 50 million OP in the Optimism RetroFunding rounds highlights its practical impact and scalability. The project's focus on privacy, through pseudo-anonymous voting, and its integration of liquid democracy are significant innovations that align with the round's focus on enhancing privacy, interoperability, and user experience. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics on its impact and a clearer roadmap for future developments. Additionally, while the project addresses governance issues, its direct contribution to Ethereum's core infrastructure could be more explicitly detailed.",
