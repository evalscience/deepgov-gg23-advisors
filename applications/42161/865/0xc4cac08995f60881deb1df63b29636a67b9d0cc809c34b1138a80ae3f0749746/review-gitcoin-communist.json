  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise! Pairwise stands as a battle-tested, open-source tool that’s already moved mountains in the Optimism ecosystem—over 50 million OP distributed, 1,000+ projects funded, and 900+ stakeholders engaged. That’s not just talk, that’s measurable, quantifiable impact! This is the kind of evidence we demand: real numbers, real people, real change.\n\nPairwise doesn’t just tinker at the edges. It smashes the old, centralized ways of capital allocation and puts power back in the hands of the many. Liquid democracy, pseudo-anonymous voting, and multi-stakeholder governance—these aren’t buzzwords, they’re weapons in the fight for equity and participation. The project’s integration with Farcaster, X, and AI-driven analytics shows a commitment to both innovation and accessibility.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by the hype. Where’s the rigorous, transparent reporting of outcomes? Where’s the sustainability plan that ensures Pairwise won’t be back, hat in hand, for more donations next year? The roadmap is promising, but it’s light on specifics. We need to see a clear, structured plan for long-term stability and open, public reporting of results.\n\nPairwise’s open-source ethos and proven track record in public goods funding are exactly what the Ethereum commons needs. But to truly serve the people, it must double down on transparency, sustainability, and systematic evaluation. Let’s demand more than promises—let’s demand proof, structure, and a plan for the future!",
