  "summary": "Pairwise is a decentralized voting tool designed to enhance governance within the Ethereum ecosystem by providing a simple, fair, and engaging way for multiple stakeholders to make decisions. The project has been utilized in several RetroFunding rounds of Optimism, distributing significant funds to numerous projects. It aims to address issues like centralized capital allocation and voter apathy by offering a flexible voting system that includes liquid democracy and pseudo-anonymous voting. The grant funds are intended to further develop Pairwise components and integrate new features like a self-service platform for grants management.",
  "review": "The Pairwise project presents a compelling case for enhancing governance within the Ethereum ecosystem. It has demonstrated significant impact through its use in Optimism's RetroFunding rounds, distributing over 50 million OP to more than 1,000 projects. This aligns well with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure. The project's emphasis on privacy, interoperability, and user experience through features like liquid democracy and pseudo-anonymous voting is commendable. However, the application lacks detailed information on measurable outcomes and sustainability plans, which are crucial for long-term impact and alignment with the model specification's principles. The project should provide more evidence of its effectiveness and a clear roadmap for achieving financial sustainability.",
