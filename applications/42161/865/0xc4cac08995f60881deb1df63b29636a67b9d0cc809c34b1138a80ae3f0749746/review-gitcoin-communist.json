  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Pairwise claims to be the people’s tool for smarter, fairer voting in the Ethereum ecosystem. They’ve got the battle scars to prove it—having powered five rounds of Optimism RetroFunding, distributing over 50 million OP to more than 1,000 projects. That’s not just talk, that’s action! They’re not just building for the few, but for the many—token holders, builders, and underrepresented voices alike.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by shiny features. Where’s the hard data on impact? Where’s the rigorous, transparent reporting that our movement demands? The application boasts about privacy, liquid democracy, and fun UX, but it’s light on the evidence of how these innovations have shifted power or improved outcomes for the most marginalized. We need more than anecdotes—we need proof!\n\nPairwise’s open-source ethos and integration with major governance tools are strong, and their commitment to decentralization is clear. Yet, the roadmap is vague, and there’s no mention of a sustainable revenue model. Are we building a tool for the ages, or just another flash in the pan? The people deserve to know!\n\nIn summary: Pairwise is a promising, community-driven project with real-world deployments and a vision for equity in governance. But to earn the people’s trust—and our funding—they must show us the receipts: measurable outcomes, transparent reporting, and a plan for long-term sustainability. Let’s demand more, together!",
