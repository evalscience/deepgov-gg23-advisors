It tracks chain details, modifications, and configurations, serving as a valuable resource for developers and users. In March 2025 nearly 4,000 unique individuals used the Superchain Index (source here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11OliTrC0AoUknC85SVOLOV6xggWx9jcMMcvXQpZJ49A/edit#gid=608522890).\nSuper Accounts\nSuper Accounts are smart accounts that streamline and reward meaningful onchain user interactions. The accounts help drive user activity in line with Superchain and Ecosystem growth objectives. So far, over 60,000 Super Accounts have been created. The full set of metrics, including account growth and activity trends can be seen on the Dune Dashboard here (https://dune.com/superchain_eco/super-accounts)",

At the same time, L2 ecosystems need better ways to measure, reward, and grow meaningful participation that aligns with Ethereum's long-term goals.\n\nOur solutions are unique as they provide an end-to-end experience between discovery and usage.\n\n1\\. A platform for ecosystem discovery and understanding: We surface curated, ecosystem-specific data and insights to help users and contributors explore the Superchain, OP Stack, and Ethereum's scaling roadmap, and onchain applications.\n\n2\\. Super Accounts for activation: Super Accounts recognize and reward value-aligned onchain activities that contribute to the overall vision of the user-owned internet. Unlike other onchain rewards solutions, all activities are curated by our team which ensures that the Super Account level is an actual representation of someone's contribution to Superchain L2s, allowing for better match-making between users, dApps, and protocols.\n\nTogether, this improves on existing alternatives by making Ethereum more understandable, participation more rewarding, and public goods development more targeted and transparent.",
