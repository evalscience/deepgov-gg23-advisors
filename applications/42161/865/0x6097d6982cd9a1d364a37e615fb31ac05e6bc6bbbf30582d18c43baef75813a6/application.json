Configurations remain portable between clients, making upgrades easier and client switching seamless if desired. This configuration-based approach is the current focus of in-progress development.\n\nThis configuration approach enables building simple UIs or editing node settings by opening the relevant text files.

These packages are designed to run efficiently without the overhead of containers.  \n\n- **Example Installation:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt update && sudo apt install eth-node-geth\n   ```\n\n   This command installs the Geth client on your system. You can use similar commands to install other clients through the `apt` package manager.  \n\n## Setting Up Networks with Configuration Packages  \neth-node also provides **pre-configured network packages**, making it easy to connect to different Ethereum networks:  \n\n- Mainnet \n- Ephemery \n- Holesky \n- Sepolia \n- Regtest (for local testing) \n\nThese packages come with all the necessary setup—like network parameters and data directories—so you don't have to configure things manually.  \n\n- **Example Network Setup:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt install eth-node-regtest eth-node-validator-regtest\n   ```\n\n   After installation, the packages automatically configure everything you need.

This ensures the binaries are secure and haven’t been tampered with, giving you peace of mind.  \n\n## Current Network Support and What’s Next  \nFor now, **regtest**, a custom network for local testing, is fully supported. Support for other networks like **Holesky** and **Mainnet** will roll out soon as part of the beta release, along with additional configuration packages.  \n\n## Help Us Improve – Your Feedback Matters  \nBinary packages are already available to get you started. Configuration packages are in **alpha**, and we’d love to hear your feedback to help us make them even better. Your input will make eth-node more user-friendly and accessible for developers and node operators alike.  \n\nIf you’d like to learn more, explore the project on GitHub, join the discussion, and help shape the future of eth-node.  \n\nFor more information, visit the project’s [GitHub](https://github.com/eth-pkg/eth-nodes).  \n",
