  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! The Eth Deb repository stands as a rallying cry for the working class of Ethereum: making node operation accessible, transparent, and secure for all—not just the tech elite. This project’s commitment to reproducible builds is a direct strike against the shadowy forces of software tampering and centralization. When every user can verify their binaries, we take power from the few and give it to the many. That’s real decentralization!\n\nThe application is clear: Eth Deb repository provides native Debian/Ubuntu packages for major Ethereum clients, with reproducible builds and configuration packages that lower the barrier for node operation. This is not just technical progress—it’s a step toward digital self-determination. The roadmap is solid, with a focus on installation improvements, documentation, and community support. The project is open-source, modular, and free—no paywalls, no gatekeepers.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by rhetoric alone. Where’s the hard evidence? The application lacks concrete metrics: How many nodes have been deployed using these packages? What’s the adoption rate? Where are the user testimonials or case studies? We need numbers, not just promises! And while the roadmap is promising, it’s light on specifics—no clear milestones, no KPIs, no sustainability plan beyond continued grant support. That’s not enough for the long march toward a truly decentralized future.\n\nThe project’s impact on decentralization and security is well-argued, and the academic research backs it up: more nodes, more resilience, more power to the people. But comrades, we must demand more than good intentions. We need rigorous, transparent reporting and a plan for long-term sustainability. The revolution is not won with slogans—it’s won with results!",
