  "summary": "MiniBridge is a cross-chain tool developed by the Chaineye team, designed to facilitate small-amount transfers across multiple blockchain networks, including BTC, EVM, and non-EVM chains. The project emphasizes zero bridge fees, fast transactions, and enhanced security through a hybrid EOA and smart contract model. It has served over 465K unique users and processed 786K transactions, contributing significantly to the Ethereum network's infrastructure. The project aims to address existing challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as high bridge costs and security risks, by providing a faster, cheaper, and more secure bridging solution. The grant funds will be used to further develop and integrate the MiniBridge across major L2s and BTC L2s, enhance community growth, and expand brand presence.",
  "review": "The MiniBridge project presents a compelling case for its contribution to the Ethereum network's infrastructure. It addresses significant challenges such as high bridge costs, long transaction times, and security risks, which are prevalent in current bridging solutions. By implementing a hybrid EOA and smart contract model, MiniBridge enhances security and reduces the possibility of contract exploitation. The project's zero-fee structure and fast transaction capabilities are particularly beneficial for retail investors, aligning with the round's focus on enhancing user experience and interoperability. The project's roadmap is well-defined, with clear milestones aimed at expanding its integration across major blockchain networks and fostering community growth. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on how it plans to ensure environmental sustainability and how it aligns with the broader constitutional principles of fostering inclusive systemic change and community participation.",
