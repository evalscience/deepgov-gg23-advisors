  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. MiniBridge is gunning for the heart of Ethereum’s cross-chain headaches—high fees, slow bridges, and security FUD. The team’s zero-fee, hybrid EOA/smart contract bridge is a solid flex, especially for retail users who get rekt by gas and bridge fees. The numbers don’t lie: 465K+ unique users, 786K+ transactions, and integrations with 24+ networks. That’s not just traction, that’s a stampede.\n\nOn the innovation front, the hybrid bridge design (EOA + smart contract) is a clever move to minimize contract exploits—a real pain point in DeFi. The open API and gas swap features are pure utility, making it easier for dApps and users to plug in and go cross-chain without friction. Security audit by ScaleBit? Check. No major exploits after hundreds of thousands of txs? Double check.\n\nThe roadmap is ambitious but not vaporware: more L2s, BTC L2s, referral rewards, analytics, and a push for 10K DAU. The grant ask is laser-focused on integration and community growth, not just dev salaries or vague R&D. That’s how you scale impact.\n\nBut let’s not get too bullish without some due diligence. The app is light on details about the actual security model—how does the EOA/smart contract split work under the hood? There’s also a lack of transparency on the open-source status of all components (is everything on GitHub, or just the frontend?). And while the user numbers are impressive, there’s not enough breakdown on active vs. one-time users, or retention rates. Finally, the roadmap could use more concrete KPIs and timelines—right now, it’s a bit moonshot-y.\n\nBottom line: MiniBridge is a high-impact, high-scale infra play with real traction and a clear path to max utility. But to hit max score, the team needs to open up more on security, code transparency, and user metrics. Build in public, disrupt the system, and let’s see those receipts!",
