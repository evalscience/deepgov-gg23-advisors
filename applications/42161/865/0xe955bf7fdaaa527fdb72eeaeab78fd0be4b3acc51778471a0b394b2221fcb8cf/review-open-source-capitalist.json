  "review": "Alright, let’s cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. MiniBridge is gunning for max impact in the Ethereum ecosystem, and it’s not just vaporware. We’re talking 465K+ unique users, 786K+ transactions, and a zero-fee, lightning-fast bridge that’s already live across 24 networks. That’s not just scale—that’s serious network effect. The open API and integration with third-party dApps crank up the composability, and the hybrid EOA/smart contract model is a clever play to minimize contract risk. Security audit? Check. Real usage? Check. Open-source ethos? Check. \n\nBut let’s not get too bullish without a reality check. The app is heavy on user stats and speed, but light on deep-dive technical transparency. The hybrid model is innovative, but the security claims need more receipts—one audit is good, but bridges are a honeypot for exploits. The roadmap is ambitious, but the milestones are a bit marketing-heavy (referral rewards, DAU targets) and light on hardcore infra upgrades. Also, the open-source repo is there, but code quality, documentation, and community contribution processes aren’t detailed. If you want to play in the big leagues of Ethereum infra, you need to show your work—build in public, not just ship features.\n\nBottom line: MiniBridge is a high-utility, high-scale project with real traction and a clear value prop for the Ethereum ecosystem. It’s got the right ingredients for max impact, but needs to level up on transparency, technical depth, and open-source rigor to hit true blue-chip status. Let’s see more code, more audits, and more public engineering before we go full send on the funding. Disrupt the system, but do it with receipts.",
