  "review": "The MiniBridge project presents a compelling case for its contribution to the Ethereum ecosystem, particularly in terms of enhancing user experience and infrastructure. The project has already achieved significant traction, with over 465K unique users and 786K transactions, indicating a strong demand for its services. The innovative hybrid bridge solution that combines EOA and smart contracts is a notable advancement, potentially reducing security risks and costs associated with cross-chain transactions. The project's roadmap is well-structured, focusing on integration with major L2s, community growth, and brand expansion, which aligns with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's foundational infrastructure. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on the project's long-term sustainability and specific metrics for measuring success beyond transaction volume and user count.",
