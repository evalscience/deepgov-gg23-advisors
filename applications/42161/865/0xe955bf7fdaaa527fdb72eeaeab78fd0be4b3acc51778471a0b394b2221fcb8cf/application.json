These problems prevent the Ethereum network from its fast-growing path and affect user experience. \n\nMiniBridge has come up with an innovative solution by implementing an EOA and smart contract combined hybrid bridge.

The benefits of this solution are that it can significantly reduce gas fees, and bridge costs while accelerating cross-chain speed. MiniBridge is currently the fastest and cheapest bridge solution across the market. In addition, it has a gas swap feature to help top up gas tokens on the destination chain. MiniBridge has opened the API docs for a broad integration by other third-party dApps.

        "description": "Minibridge is a \"zero-fee\" cross-chain tool that offers multi-chain support for BTC/EVM/non-EVM and features such as fast transactions. It was developed by the Chaineye team specifically for users' small-amount transfer scenarios. Launched for 10 months, Minibridge has already processed 575K transactions and served 317K Web3 users. In user ratings on dappsheriff.com, Minibridge ranked first among all cross-chain bridge projects and was awarded \"Best Tool of the Year\" in the \"PARTY AWARD 2024\" annual selection by PA News.\n\n\nKey Features\nChaineye was born from the Web3 community and we build products for the community’s needs. To better serve the community, Chaineye has built many free tools such as Onchain Map, CEX Transfer Fees, Multichain Gas, RPC List, etc. The Mini Bridge was designed specifically for retail investors with small-amount cross-chain transfer requests, including the following features:\n1.\t Zero bridge fees: We don’t charge any bridge fees at all. This means users will get the same amount of assets on the destination chains. We are built for retail investors and we believe our community like free services. Only a minimum gas fee on the destination chain is charged.\n2.\tFastest transactions: Our bridge has the fastest bridging experience across all existing bridges. The bridging time largely depends on the confirmation time of source and destination blockchains. We don’t want our users to wait any longer than the evitable blockchain transaction time. \n3.\tDesigned especially for small-amount transfer scenarios such as gas refill, airdrop claiming, moving funds, etc. It helps to save huge money and time for individual investors when doing so.\n4.\tGas swap: Our community wants to use the destination chain directly after bridging. We get it! The gas swap feature allows users to swap a small amount of source chain ETH to the destination chain native gas token. It is very useful for those chains where ETH is not the native gas token such as BNB Chain, Polygon, ZetaChain, ZkFair, Avalanche, Map, Mantle, and Metis. \n5.\tFast Integration: Our team is monitoring the market closely and is ready to integrate the latest blockchains in time. Chaineye Mini Bridge currently supports a total of 24 networks including the latest Blast EVM L2 and Merlin BTC L2 blockchain.\n6.\tOpen API: We have opened the API docs on our documentation site. Any individuals or third parties can go through the API and seamlessly integrate Mini Bridge into their application. Chaineye Mini Bridge works in the same style for both requests from our front-end UI and API endpoints.\n7.\tSecurity: To prevent the potential security concern of smart contracts, we have implemented our bridge in a hybrid style - a combination of EOA and smart contracts. EOA for cross-chain transfers and smart contracts for cross-chain gas swaps. It helps to reduce the possibility of contract exploitation. In addition, we have our entire system audited and scrutinized by our security partners.\n8.\tRewards and Earn: Our users can enjoy a big bridge discount by participating in our various marketing campaigns. In addition, they can also earn referral rewards in ETH and $pMNB whenever their referred address makes a transfer. Everything is transparent and Chaineye Mini Bridge is built for the community.\n\n\nProject Resource\nWebsite: https://minibridge.chaineye.tools/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Chaineye_tools\nTelegram: https://t.me/chaineye\nGithub: https://github.com/DeFiEye\nDocumentation: https://docs.chaineye.tools/\n \n",

      "description": "Minibridge is a \"zero-fee\" cross-chain tool that offers multi-chain support for BTC/EVM/non-EVM and features such as fast transactions. It was developed by the Chaineye team specifically for users' small-amount transfer scenarios. Launched for 10 months, Minibridge has already processed 575K transactions and served 317K Web3 users. In user ratings on dappsheriff.com, Minibridge ranked first among all cross-chain bridge projects and was awarded \"Best Tool of the Year\" in the \"PARTY AWARD 2024\" annual selection by PA News.\n\n\nKey Features\nChaineye was born from the Web3 community and we build products for the community’s needs. To better serve the community, Chaineye has built many free tools such as Onchain Map, CEX Transfer Fees, Multichain Gas, RPC List, etc. The Mini Bridge was designed specifically for retail investors with small-amount cross-chain transfer requests, including the following features:\n1.\t Zero bridge fees: We don’t charge any bridge fees at all. This means users will get the same amount of assets on the destination chains. We are built for retail investors and we believe our community like free services. Only a minimum gas fee on the destination chain is charged.\n2.\tFastest transactions: Our bridge has the fastest bridging experience across all existing bridges. The bridging time largely depends on the confirmation time of source and destination blockchains. We don’t want our users to wait any longer than the evitable blockchain transaction time. \n3.\tDesigned especially for small-amount transfer scenarios such as gas refill, airdrop claiming, moving funds, etc. It helps to save huge money and time for individual investors when doing so.\n4.\tGas swap: Our community wants to use the destination chain directly after bridging. We get it! The gas swap feature allows users to swap a small amount of source chain ETH to the destination chain native gas token. It is very useful for those chains where ETH is not the native gas token such as BNB Chain, Polygon, ZetaChain, ZkFair, Avalanche, Map, Mantle, and Metis. \n5.\tFast Integration: Our team is monitoring the market closely and is ready to integrate the latest blockchains in time. Chaineye Mini Bridge currently supports a total of 24 networks including the latest Blast EVM L2 and Merlin BTC L2 blockchain.\n6.\tOpen API: We have opened the API docs on our documentation site. Any individuals or third parties can go through the API and seamlessly integrate Mini Bridge into their application. Chaineye Mini Bridge works in the same style for both requests from our front-end UI and API endpoints.\n7.\tSecurity: To prevent the potential security concern of smart contracts, we have implemented our bridge in a hybrid style - a combination of EOA and smart contracts. EOA for cross-chain transfers and smart contracts for cross-chain gas swaps. It helps to reduce the possibility of contract exploitation. In addition, we have our entire system audited and scrutinized by our security partners.\n8.\tRewards and Earn: Our users can enjoy a big bridge discount by participating in our various marketing campaigns. In addition, they can also earn referral rewards in ETH and $pMNB whenever their referred address makes a transfer. Everything is transparent and Chaineye Mini Bridge is built for the community.\n\n\nProject Resource\nWebsite: https://minibridge.chaineye.tools/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Chaineye_tools\nTelegram: https://t.me/chaineye\nGithub: https://github.com/DeFiEye\nDocumentation: https://docs.chaineye.tools/\n \n",
