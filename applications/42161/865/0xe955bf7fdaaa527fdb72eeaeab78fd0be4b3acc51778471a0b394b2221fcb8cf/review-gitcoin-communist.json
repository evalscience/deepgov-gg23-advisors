  "summary": "MiniBridge is a cross-chain tool designed to enhance the Ethereum network's infrastructure by providing a zero-fee, fast, and secure bridging solution. It supports multiple blockchain networks and aims to improve user experience, particularly for retail investors. The project has demonstrated significant usage metrics and has a clear roadmap for further development and integration.",
  "review": "The MiniBridge project presents a compelling case for its contribution to the Ethereum network's infrastructure. It has served over 465K unique users and processed 786K transactions, indicating a strong user base and demand for its services. The project's innovative approach, combining EOA and smart contracts, enhances security and reduces costs, addressing key challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem. The roadmap is well-defined, with milestones focusing on integration, community growth, and brand expansion. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on its sustainability model and how it plans to maintain operations without continuous grant support. Additionally, while the project has undergone a security audit, further transparency in reporting these results would strengthen its credibility.",
