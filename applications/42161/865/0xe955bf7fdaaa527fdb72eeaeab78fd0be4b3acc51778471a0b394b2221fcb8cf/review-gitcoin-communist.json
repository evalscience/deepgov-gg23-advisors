  "review": "Let’s cut through the noise: MiniBridge is a project that claims to put power back in the hands of the people, making cross-chain transfers accessible, fast, and cheap for the everyday user. The numbers are impressive—over 465,000 unique users, 786,000 transactions, and a zero-fee model that directly challenges the profit-driven status quo. This is the kind of infrastructure that can help democratize Ethereum, not just for whales, but for the working class of Web3.\n\nThe project’s hybrid EOA and smart contract bridge is a notable innovation, aiming to reduce contract exploitation risks and lower costs. Security audits and a clean track record (no exploits in hundreds of thousands of transactions) show a commitment to safety and reliability. The open API and integration with third-party dApps further the cause of interoperability and collective benefit.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by rhetoric alone. The application falls short in several key areas. There’s a lack of rigorous, transparent reporting on outcomes—where are the detailed, public metrics and impact assessments? The roadmap is ambitious, but it’s heavy on marketing and community growth, light on sustainable revenue models or long-term system stability. The project’s reliance on continuous grants and giveaways raises questions about its ability to stand on its own two feet. And while the team touts security audits, there’s no public, verifiable report linked in the application.\n\nWe must demand more than promises and big numbers. We need clear, measurable outcomes, transparent reporting, and a path to sustainability. MiniBridge is on the right track, but it must do more to prove it’s building for the many, not just the moment.",
