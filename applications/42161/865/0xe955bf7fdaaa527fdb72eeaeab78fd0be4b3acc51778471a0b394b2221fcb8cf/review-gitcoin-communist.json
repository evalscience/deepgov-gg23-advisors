It aims to address common issues in existing bridge solutions, such as high fees and long transaction times, by implementing a hybrid bridge model that combines EOA and smart contracts. The project has a clear roadmap with milestones focused on expanding integration, enhancing user engagement, and promoting community growth.",
  "review": "The MiniBridge project presents a compelling case for its contribution to the Ethereum ecosystem, particularly in terms of enhancing user experience and reducing transaction costs. The project's innovative approach to bridging, using a hybrid model of EOA and smart contracts, addresses key issues in the current market, such as security risks and high fees. The project's metrics, including serving 465K unique users and processing 786K transactions, provide strong evidence of its impact and relevance. Additionally, the project's roadmap outlines clear and achievable milestones that align with the round's focus on infrastructure development and scalability. However, the application could benefit from more detailed information on its sustainability model and how it plans to maintain operations without continuous grant support. Furthermore, while the project has been audited, additional details on the audit results and any identified risks would strengthen the application.",
