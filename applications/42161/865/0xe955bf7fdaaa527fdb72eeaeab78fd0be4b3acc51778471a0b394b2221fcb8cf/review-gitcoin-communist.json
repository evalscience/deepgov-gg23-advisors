  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! MiniBridge claims to be a zero-fee, fast, and secure cross-chain bridge, serving the working class of Web3—retail users who are too often left behind by high fees and slow transactions. The numbers are impressive: over 465,000 unique users, 786,000 transactions, and integrations across 24 networks. That’s not just talk—that’s real, measurable impact! The Dune dashboard and public stats back it up. \n\nThe project’s hybrid EOA and smart contract model is a bold attempt to address the chronic security issues plaguing bridges. They’ve completed a third-party audit and have a clean record so far. Their open API and integration with aggregators like RawR show a commitment to interoperability and the public good. The roadmap is ambitious, with clear milestones and a focus on community growth, analytics, and further decentralization. \n\nBut let’s not be blinded by numbers alone! Where’s the evidence of sustainable revenue? Zero-fee is noble, but how will this project survive without perpetual grants? The application is light on details about governance—who holds the power, and how is the community involved in decision-making? And while the security audit is a good start, more transparency is needed: where’s the public report? Where’s the ongoing commitment to rigorous, transparent evaluation?\n\nWe demand more than just promises—we demand proof, sustainability, and a clear path to collective ownership! MiniBridge is on the right track, but must do more to ensure it’s not just another flash in the pan, but a lasting pillar of the Ethereum commons.",
