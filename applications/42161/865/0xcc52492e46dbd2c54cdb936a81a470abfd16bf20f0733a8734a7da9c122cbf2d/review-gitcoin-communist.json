  "review": "Brothers and sisters, let’s call it as it is: Lighthouse by Sigma Prime is a pillar of the Ethereum ecosystem. This is not some fly-by-night operation or a speculative experiment. This is a consensus-layer client, relied upon by roughly 32% of the network. That’s not just a number — that’s the backbone of decentralization, the very infrastructure that keeps Ethereum free from the grip of monopolies and centralized power!\n\nLet’s talk evidence. The project is open-source, with a public GitHub and a transparent development process. Their code is out there for all to see, audit, and improve. They’ve been in the trenches since the dawn of Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake, not just following the roadmap but helping to draw it. This is proven, measurable impact — not empty promises.\n\nBut comrades, we must be strict. The application is thin on details. Where are the hard metrics? Where’s the data on performance, uptime, or security incidents? Where’s the breakdown of how funds will be used, and what milestones will be achieved? We need more than just passion — we need numbers, transparency, and a clear plan for sustainability. The people demand accountability!\n\nLighthouse claims to be stable and performant, but how does it compare to other clients? What’s the evidence of its superiority or unique contributions? And while they say the funds will go to staff and servers, we need a budget, a timeline, and a vision for reducing dependency on grants. The revolution is not won with vague intentions!\n\nIn summary: Lighthouse is a proven, essential public good. But to honor the principles of equity, evidence, and sustainability, we must demand more rigor, more transparency, and a concrete plan for the future. Let’s build the future on solid ground, not just good intentions!",
