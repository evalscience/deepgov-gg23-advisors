  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Lighthouse by Sigma Prime stands as a pillar of the Ethereum ecosystem, powering roughly 32% of the network’s consensus layer. That’s not just a number — it’s a testament to the project’s real, measurable impact on the infrastructure that underpins our digital commons. This is not some speculative experiment; it’s a proven, open-source solution relied upon by thousands. \n\nThe application demonstrates clear alignment with the round’s goals: strengthening Ethereum’s foundation, advancing decentralization, and ensuring security. Lighthouse’s open-source ethos and commitment to public goods are beyond question. The project’s pioneering work in Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake transition is well-documented, and their ongoing development for the Electra fork shows a commitment to long-term stability, not just quick wins.\n\nBut let’s not let reputation alone carry the day! The application is too brief, lacking the rigorous, data-driven detail we demand. Where are the hard metrics on performance improvements, user growth, or security incidents averted? Where is the transparent reporting on past grant outcomes? The roadmap is vague — “staff, servers, etc.” is not a plan, it’s a shopping list. We need specifics: milestones, deliverables, and timelines. \n\nSustainability is another missing piece. How will Lighthouse reduce reliance on grants? What’s the plan for long-term funding? The application must address these questions to ensure we’re not just plugging holes, but building a resilient future.\n\nIn summary: Lighthouse is a cornerstone of Ethereum, but this application must rise to the same standard of excellence it claims to uphold. The people deserve transparency, accountability, and a clear vision for the future!",
