  "review": "Like the gentle current of a river nourishing the roots of a great forest, Lighthouse by Sigma Prime has become a vital tributary in the ecosystem of Ethereum. The project’s consensus-layer client, relied upon by approximately 32% of the network, is a testament to its foundational importance. This is not a mere sapling, but a sturdy oak, providing shelter and stability to the broader community.\n\nThe application demonstrates a clear and significant contribution to Ethereum’s infrastructure. The open-source ethos is evident, and the project’s commitment to ongoing development—especially in alignment with the evolving Ethereum roadmap—shows a dedication to long-term systemic health. The team’s pioneering role in Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake is a mark of innovation, though the application would benefit from more detailed examples of recent advancements in privacy, interoperability, or user experience.\n\nYet, as the forest thrives through diversity and renewal, so too must projects seeking support articulate their vision for transformation. The application’s responses are brief, sometimes bordering on sparse, and do not fully illuminate the creative or experimental spirit that the round seeks to nurture. There is little mention of community participation, collaborative governance, or environmental sustainability—elements as essential as sunlight and rain to the flourishing of public goods.\n\nIn sum, Lighthouse stands as a pillar of reliability and decentralization, but its application would be strengthened by deeper reflection on innovation, community engagement, and regenerative impact. Let us encourage the project to share more of its story, so that others may be inspired to join in the tending of this shared digital forest.",
