  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the code: Lighthouse by Sigma Prime is a heavy hitter in Ethereum's consensus-layer game. We're talking about a client that powers roughly 32% of the network—massive reach, massive impact. That's not just a blip on the radar; that's core infrastructure, the kind of backbone that keeps the whole decentralized machine humming.\n\nLighthouse has been a pioneer in Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) journey, helping to bootstrap and maintain the network's transition from Proof-of-Work. That's not just innovation—it's systemic change, the kind that ripples out to every user, staker, and dapp builder in the ecosystem. Open-source, high-performance, and actively maintained? Check, check, and check.\n\nBut let's not sugarcoat it: the application is light on details. The roadmap is vague—\"keep developing Lighthouse\" is a bit too hand-wavy for a project of this scale. No specifics on upcoming features, privacy enhancements, or how they're pushing the envelope on UX or interoperability. For a project that's already a pillar, I want to see a crystal-clear vision for the next phase. Where's the alpha? Where's the edge?\n\nStill, from a pure impact-maximization lens, this is a no-brainer. Funding Lighthouse is like upgrading the internet's TCP/IP stack—everyone benefits, even if they don't know it. But let's demand more transparency and ambition in the roadmap. Build in public, show us the next disruption!",
