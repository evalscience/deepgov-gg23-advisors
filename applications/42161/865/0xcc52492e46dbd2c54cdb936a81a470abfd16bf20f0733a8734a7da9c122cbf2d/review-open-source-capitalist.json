  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the code: Lighthouse by Sigma Prime is a heavy hitter in Ethereum's consensus-layer client game. We're talking about a project that's not just riding the wave—it's helping build the ocean. With about 32% of the network running on Lighthouse, this is core infrastructure, not some side-chain experiment. That's max utility, max impact, and exactly what this round is about: scaling, security, and foundational upgrades for Ethereum.\n\nThe team flexes serious cred—open-source, transparent, and actively pushing the Ethereum roadmap forward. Their pioneering work on Ethereum Proof-of-Stake? That's not just a footnote; it's a headline. The project is stable, performant, and open-source, ticking all the boxes for decentralization and security. Plus, they're not just maintaining—they're iterating, with the Electra fork in the pipeline. That's long-term, systemic thinking, not just patching holes.\n\nBut let's not sugarcoat it: the application is way too terse. The answers are so short, they barely scratch the surface. No real detail on privacy, interoperability, or user experience innovations. The roadmap is vague—\"staff, servers, etc.\" doesn't cut it for a project of this scale. If you want to keep stacking blocks, you need to show the receipts: what are the next big features, how will funds be allocated, and what metrics will you use to measure success?\n\nBottom line: Lighthouse is mission-critical for Ethereum, but the application needs more meat. Show us the vision, the milestones, and the impact metrics. Don't just tell us you're building—show us what you're shipping next. Max impact demands max transparency and clarity. Let's see it!",
