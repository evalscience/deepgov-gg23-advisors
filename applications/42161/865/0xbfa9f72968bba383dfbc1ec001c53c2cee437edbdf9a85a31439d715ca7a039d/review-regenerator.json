  "summary": "The Stakers Union is a collective of solo-stakers focused on preserving the health and decentralization of the Ethereum network. The project addresses the centralization of Ethereum's validator set by supporting solo-stakers through a unique verification process and partnerships with key ecosystem participants. The application outlines a roadmap for 2025, emphasizing community engagement, partnerships, and funding applications to support solo-stakers. The project contributes to the decentralization and security of the Ethereum network by distributing validator power away from centralized entities and encouraging diversity.",
  "review": "The Stakers Union project presents a compelling case for supporting solo-stakers, which are crucial for maintaining Ethereum's decentralization and security. The application highlights a unique verification process that ensures only independent operators are eligible for membership, which is a significant contribution to the Ethereum network's infrastructure. The project also addresses the challenge of centralization by providing incentives for solo-stakers, which is a critical issue in the Ethereum ecosystem. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics and examples to demonstrate its impact and effectiveness. Additionally, while the project outlines a roadmap, it lacks specific details on how the grant funds will be used to achieve its development goals.",
