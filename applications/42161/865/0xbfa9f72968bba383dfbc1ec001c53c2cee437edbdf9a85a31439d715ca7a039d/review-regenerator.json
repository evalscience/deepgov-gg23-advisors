The roadmap includes expanding membership, integrating Gitcoin Passport, and participating in public goods funding rounds.",
  "review": "The Stakers Union project presents a compelling case for supporting solo-stakers, which are crucial for maintaining the decentralization and security of the Ethereum network. The project has a clear focus on addressing the challenges posed by centralized staking solutions and offers a novel verification process to ensure the legitimacy of its members. The roadmap is well-defined, with specific goals and partnerships that align with the project's mission. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics on the impact of their efforts and a clearer explanation of how the grant funds will be specifically utilized to achieve their objectives.",
