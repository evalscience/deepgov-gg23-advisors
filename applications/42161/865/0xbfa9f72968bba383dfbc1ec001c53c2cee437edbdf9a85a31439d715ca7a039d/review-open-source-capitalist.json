  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get straight to the code: Stakers Union is gunning for the heart of Ethereum’s decentralization problem. They’re not just talking the talk—they’ve got a verified, growing collective of solo-stakers, a robust verification process, and real traction with ecosystem partners like Obol and StakeCat. That’s a big plus for credible neutrality and validator diversity, which are core to Ethereum’s long-term health.\n\nTheir approach is pragmatic: incentivize solo-stakers, keep the network credibly neutral, and fight the centralization creep from liquid staking and SaaS providers. The verification process is innovative—proof of eligibility, independent operation, and optional home operation—balancing privacy with legitimacy. That’s a rare combo in the wild west of Web3.\n\nOn the roadmap, they’re not just spinning up vaporware. There’s a clear plan: grow the membership, integrate with Gitcoin Passport (Sybil resistance FTW), expand partnerships, and keep the community loop tight with regular calls. Funds go straight to verified members via a Splits contract—no bureaucratic bloat, just direct incentives to the folks running the nodes.\n\nBut let’s not get too starry-eyed. The impact, while crucial, is still limited to the solo-staker niche. There’s no hard data on how much validator centralization they’ve actually reversed, and the scale is capped by the number of people willing to run home validators. The roadmap could use more concrete KPIs and a clearer path to scaling beyond the current member base. Also, the application could be more explicit about how funds will be used to drive measurable, ecosystem-wide impact—not just internal incentives.\n\nBottom line: Stakers Union is a high-signal, low-noise project with real potential for systemic impact, but needs to level up on scale, metrics, and clarity of impact to max out the utility score.\n",
