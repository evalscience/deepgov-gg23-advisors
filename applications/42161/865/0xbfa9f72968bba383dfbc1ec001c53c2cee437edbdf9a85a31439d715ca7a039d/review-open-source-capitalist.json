  "summary": "The Stakers Union project aims to support solo-stakers in the Ethereum network by providing a collective platform that encourages decentralization and security. The project has developed a unique verification process for its members and seeks to address the centralization issues caused by large staking services. The application outlines a roadmap for 2025, focusing on expanding membership, integrating Gitcoin Passport, and participating in public goods funding rounds.",
  "review": "The Stakers Union project presents a compelling case for supporting solo-stakers, a crucial component of Ethereum's decentralization and security. The application highlights the project's unique verification process, which ensures that only independent operators are eligible for membership. This process is a significant innovation, enhancing privacy and legitimacy for solo-stakers. The project also addresses the centralization challenge posed by large staking services, aiming to secure out-of-network incentives to encourage solo-staking. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics on its impact and a clearer explanation of how the grant funds will be specifically utilized to achieve its goals. Additionally, while the project aligns with the round's focus on Ethereum infrastructure, it should provide more evidence of its pioneering development work in enhancing privacy, interoperability, or user experience.",
