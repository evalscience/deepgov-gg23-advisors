Our dedication to building this collective of solo-stakers has resulted in encouraging partnerships with key ecosystem participants including [Obol](https://obol.org/) (which began by having Stakers Union members operating testnet distributed validators). In addition, our verification process was deemed sufficiently reliable by [StakeCat](https://www.stakecat.space/solo-stakers), a central organization in the independent operator space (responsible for distribution of solo-staker lists) to allow Stakers Union verified members to be included in future lists if not already captured by their existing heuristics.\n\nOur novel verification process includes three key elements:\n- **Proof of Eligibility:** Prospective members sign an oath from an eligible address (an address listed on StakeCat’s list of solo-stakers) or can submit an appeal for eligibility which is proposed to verified members.\n- **Proof of Independent Operation:** Prospective members demonstrate validator ownership by temporarily disabling attestations during an assigned window - proving validator access and independent operation.\n- **Proof of Residential Operation:** Members can optionally demonstrate home operation by submitting a timestamped photo of their node (with metadata stripped to preserve privacy).\n\nThis approach offers private identity with public legitimacy, allowing members to remain pseudonymous while proving their validator participation.\n",

          "answer": "The Stakers Union is directly aimed at addressing the growing centralization of Ethereum’s validator set, driven by large staking-as-a-service providers. While these solutions offer partial decentralization, they still rely on pooled infrastructure and can lead to validator clustering. The ease-of-use of these solutions as well as other benefits including the availability of high-utility liquid staking tokens reduces the incentives for independent operation. While Stakers Union members have pledged their commitment to the Ethereum network - it is plausible that new entrants may be deterred from solo-staking when alternative solutions like liquid staking are easier, offer higher-rewards and require less individual effort.\n\nBy design, the Ethereum network cannot detect higher-utility solo- and home-stakers from centralized operators. As a result and to encourage continued and new solo-stakers, the Stakers Union aims to secure out-of-network incentives to provide augmented, long-term incentives for continued solo-staking, including through public funding processes.",

Liquid staking and restaking protocols and their associated liquid tokens drive many away from solo-staking.\n\nThe Solution\nWe are building a collective of avid and passionate solo-stakers to support their activities by securing stable incentives from ecosystem participants.\n\nCurrent Progress\nWe have defined defined a robust, multi-step verification process and have over 130 verified members. Our members and other interested participants are active in our Discord where we explore staking-related topics and advocate for solo-stakers.\n\n",
