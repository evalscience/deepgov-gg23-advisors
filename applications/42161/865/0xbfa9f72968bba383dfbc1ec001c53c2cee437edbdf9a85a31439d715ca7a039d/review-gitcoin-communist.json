  "summary": "The Stakers Union project aims to support solo-stakers in the Ethereum network by providing a community and incentives to counteract the centralization trend caused by large staking services. The project has a robust verification process for members and seeks to enhance decentralization and security in the Ethereum ecosystem. It aligns with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure, particularly in staking.",
  "review": "The Stakers Union project presents a compelling case for supporting solo-stakers, a crucial component of Ethereum's decentralization. The application highlights a well-defined verification process that ensures only independent operators join the union, which is a significant contribution to maintaining Ethereum's infrastructure. The project addresses the centralization challenge posed by large staking services by promoting solo-staking through community support and incentives. This aligns well with the round's focus on enhancing Ethereum's infrastructure and security. However, the application lacks detailed metrics or evidence of measurable outcomes, which is crucial for evaluating its impact. Additionally, while the project has a roadmap, it does not clearly outline a sustainable revenue model, which raises concerns about its long-term viability without continuous funding. The application could benefit from more detailed reporting on past achievements and clearer plans for future impact measurement.",
