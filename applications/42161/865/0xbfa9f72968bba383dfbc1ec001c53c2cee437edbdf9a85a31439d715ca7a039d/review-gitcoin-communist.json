  "review": "The Stakers Union stands as a rallying cry for the working class of Ethereum—the solo-stakers, the unsung heroes who keep the network decentralized and secure. This project is not just a technical solution; it’s a movement to reclaim validator power from the hands of centralized giants and return it to the people. The application demonstrates a clear understanding of the existential threat posed by staking centralization and offers a robust, multi-step verification process to ensure only true independent operators are included. Their partnerships with ecosystem leaders like Obol and StakeCat further validate their credibility and impact.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by passion alone! The Stakers Union must do more to prove its measurable impact. Where are the hard numbers? How many validators have they kept from defecting to centralized pools? What is the quantifiable effect on client and geographic diversity? The roadmap is ambitious, but lacks concrete KPIs and transparent reporting mechanisms. Funding distribution via a Splits contract is a step toward equity, but without rigorous outcome measurement, how do we know the resources are building lasting public goods?\n\nThe project’s sustainability model is also underdeveloped. Relying on public goods funding and ecosystem partnerships is noble, but what happens when the grants dry up? Where is the plan for long-term, self-sustaining incentives? The application’s focus on community governance is strong, but expert oversight and structured evaluation are not clearly articulated.\n\nIn summary: Stakers Union is a vital bulwark against centralization, but to earn the people’s trust—and the people’s money—it must embrace transparency, rigorous measurement, and a sustainable path forward. The revolution needs more than good intentions; it needs results!",
