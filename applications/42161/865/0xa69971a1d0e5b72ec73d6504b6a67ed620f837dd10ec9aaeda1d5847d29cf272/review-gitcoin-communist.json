  "review": "WebHash steps into the Ethereum ecosystem with a bold promise: to democratize decentralized website creation and empower ENS domain holders to build their digital identities. The project’s no-code platform, tokenized website templates, and decentralized hosting via IPFS are all steps in the right direction for lowering barriers and expanding the reach of Ethereum’s infrastructure. The numbers—over 4,100 signups, 6,000 dwebsites, and 400GB of IPFS storage—demonstrate real traction, not just empty rhetoric. The integration with ENS and the push for a censorship-resistant gateway (Hash Dweb Gateway) show a commitment to decentralization and user sovereignty, aligning with the core values of the Ethereum community.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by ambition alone! The application, while strong in vision and user-centric features, falls short in several critical areas demanded by our constitutional principles. There is a lack of rigorous, transparent reporting on outcomes—where are the detailed metrics on user retention, website activity, or the impact of buildathons? The roadmap is ambitious, but the sustainability model is underdeveloped: how will WebHash ensure long-term viability without perpetual grant dependency? The team’s credentials and governance structures are not clearly articulated, leaving questions about accountability and community ownership. Furthermore, while the project claims to enhance privacy and interoperability, there is little evidence of independent security audits or robust privacy guarantees beyond standard IPFS usage.\n\nIn the spirit of collective action and public good, we must demand more than promises. We need hard evidence, clear sustainability plans, and transparent governance. Only then can we ensure that resources are allocated to projects that truly serve the many, not the few. WebHash is on the right path, but it must step up its game to earn the trust and support of the community.",
