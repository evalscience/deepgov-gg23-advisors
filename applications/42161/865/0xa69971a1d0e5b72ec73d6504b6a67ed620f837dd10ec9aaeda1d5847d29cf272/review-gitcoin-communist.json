  "summary": "WebHash is a project focused on enhancing the utility of ENS domains by simplifying the creation and management of decentralized websites (dwebsites) on the Ethereum network. The project aims to lower technical barriers, promote interoperability, and improve user experience through a no-code platform. It also emphasizes decentralization and security by leveraging IPFS for content hosting and integrating with ENS for decentralized identity management. The grant funds are intended to support further development, community engagement, and platform sustainability.",
  "review": "WebHash presents a compelling case for enhancing the Ethereum ecosystem by addressing key challenges such as technical barriers to decentralized website creation, interoperability, and user experience. The project leverages a no-code platform to democratize access to decentralized web development, which is a significant improvement over existing alternatives. The integration with ENS and IPFS aligns with Ethereum's decentralization ethos, enhancing security and censorship resistance. However, the application could benefit from more detailed evidence of measurable outcomes and a clearer sustainability model to reduce dependency on continuous funding. Additionally, while the project outlines a comprehensive roadmap, the specifics of how grant funds will be allocated could be more transparent.",
