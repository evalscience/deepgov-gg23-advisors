  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! WebHash steps up with a bold vision: to democratize the decentralized web, smashing the technical barriers that keep ordinary people from building their own digital homes on Ethereum. The project’s focus on no-code tools, ENS integration, and decentralized hosting is a direct strike against the gatekeeping of Web3. Their stats—over 4,100 signups, 6,000+ dwebsites, and 400GB on IPFS—show real, measurable traction. This is not vaporware; it’s boots on the ground, building the commons!\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by shiny features. The application falls short in several critical areas. Where is the rigorous, transparent reporting of outcomes? Where is the evidence of long-term sustainability beyond grant cycles? The roadmap is ambitious, but it lacks concrete, quantifiable milestones and clear metrics for success. We need more than promises—we need proof! The project’s revenue model (template marketplace, storage plans) is a step in the right direction, but details are thin. How will this reduce dependency on grants? How will the community govern and sustain this infrastructure for the long haul?\n\nWebHash’s commitment to open-source and public goods is clear, but the application must do more to show how benefits will be distributed equitably, especially to underserved communities. The governance structure is not described—who holds power, and how is the community involved in decision-making? Without these answers, we risk repeating the mistakes of centralized tech.\n\nIn summary: WebHash is a promising, community-oriented project with real impact, but it must strengthen its evidence, sustainability, and governance to truly serve the people. Let’s demand more—because the future of the decentralized web belongs to all of us, not just the few!",
