  "review": "Alright, let’s plug in and break down WebHash’s grant app with a strict, high-voltage lens. This project is gunning to be the no-code, turbo-charged on-ramp for ENS-powered decentralized websites—think Squarespace for Web3, but with a crypto-native twist. The pitch is clear: lower the technical barrier, supercharge ENS adoption, and make dwebsites as easy as minting an NFT. Metrics? 4,100+ signups, 6,000+ dwebsites, 400GB on IPFS. That’s not vaporware, that’s traction.\n\nWebHash is laser-focused on maximizing impact: it’s not just a tool for a niche crowd, but a platform that could onboard tens of thousands of ENS holders into the decentralized web. That’s a big win for Ethereum’s infra, especially if you care about scale and utility. The roadmap is ambitious—token-gated content, AI moderation, integrations with Farcaster, Lens, POAP, and more. If they execute, this is a multiplier for the whole ecosystem.\n\nOn the innovation front, tokenizing website templates as ERC-1155 NFTs is a clever play. It’s a new revenue model and a way to bootstrap a creator economy around dwebsites. The Hash Dweb Gateway is another strong move, aiming to kill off centralized .eth resolvers and keep things censorship-resistant. That’s pure Ethereum ethos.\n\nBut let’s not get lost in the hype. There are some weak spots. The app is light on technical detail—how exactly does the Hash Gateway work? What’s the security model? How do they handle moderation and abuse at scale? The budget and team breakdown are MIA, which is a red flag for a grant of this scale. And while the numbers are solid, there’s no clear plan for scaling from 6,000 to 60,000+ sites—what’s the infra plan? How do they avoid centralization bottlenecks?\n\nBottom line: WebHash is high-potential, high-impact, and aligns with the round’s mission to boost Ethereum’s foundational infra. But to unlock max utility, they need to open up the hood and show more technical and operational transparency. No free rides in the open-source fast lane!",
