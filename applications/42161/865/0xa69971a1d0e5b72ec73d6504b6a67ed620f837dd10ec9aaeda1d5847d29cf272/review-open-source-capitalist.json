  "review": "Alright, let’s cut through the noise and get straight to the alpha. WebHash is gunning to be the no-code, plug-and-play dwebsite builder for ENS domains, aiming to turn every .eth into a decentralized digital identity hub. The project’s got traction—4,100+ signups, 6,000+ dwebsites, and 400GB on IPFS. That’s not vaporware, that’s real usage. They’re not just slapping a UI on top of ENS; they’re tokenizing templates (ERC-1155), integrating with IPFS for censorship resistance, and building a gateway to resolve .eth domains natively—no more centralized choke points like .limo. \n\nFrom a maximization lens, this is high-leverage stuff. Lowering the technical barrier for 800K+ ENS holders to actually use their domains as decentralized identities? That’s a multiplier effect for Ethereum’s network utility. The roadmap is ambitious: token-gated content, AI moderation, and a buffet of integrations (Farcaster, Lens, POAP, DAOs, etc.). If they execute, this could be a foundational layer for decentralized web presence—think WordPress for Web3, but with on-chain provenance and composability baked in.\n\nBut let’s not get too bullish without checking the fundamentals. The app is heavy on vision and feature lists, but light on open-source transparency. There’s a GitHub, but the repo status and code openness aren’t detailed. Also, while the numbers are solid, there’s no breakdown of active vs. dormant sites, or retention metrics. The Hash Gateway is a killer feature, but security and decentralization claims need more technical receipts. And while the roadmap is packed, there’s no granular budget or timeline—just broad strokes.\n\nBottom line: WebHash is swinging for max impact, attacking root causes (digital decay, onboarding friction) and building infra that scales. But to hit the next level, they need to open up more on code, metrics, and execution details. Show us the receipts, and this could be a flagship infra play for Ethereum’s decentralized web.\n\nCitations: Application answers (metrics, roadmap, feature set), round requirements (infra, privacy, UX, open-source), model spec (max utility, long-term infra, innovation, efficiency).",
