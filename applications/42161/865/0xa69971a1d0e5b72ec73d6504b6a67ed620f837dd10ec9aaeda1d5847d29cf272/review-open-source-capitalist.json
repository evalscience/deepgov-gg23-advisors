  "summary": "WebHash is a platform designed to enhance the utility of ENS domains by enabling the creation of decentralized websites (dwebsites) without requiring coding skills. The project aims to address the challenges of digital decay and centralized hosting vulnerabilities by leveraging decentralized technologies like IPFS and ENS. WebHash offers a no-code platform, tokenized website templates, and various integrations to simplify the creation and management of dwebsites, thereby promoting broader adoption of decentralized web technologies.",
  "review": "WebHash presents a compelling solution to enhance the utility of ENS domains by simplifying the creation of decentralized websites. The project aligns well with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure, particularly in decentralized identity and security innovations. The use of IPFS for decentralized hosting and the integration with ENS for human-readable domains are significant contributions to the Ethereum ecosystem. The project's roadmap, which includes token-gated websites and AI content moderation, demonstrates a forward-thinking approach to enhancing user experience and platform functionality. However, the application could benefit from more detailed metrics on user engagement and the impact of their buildathons. Additionally, while the project addresses key challenges, it should provide more evidence of its scalability and long-term sustainability.",
