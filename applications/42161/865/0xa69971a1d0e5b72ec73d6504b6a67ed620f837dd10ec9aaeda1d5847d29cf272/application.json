          "answer": "WebHash contributes to Ethereum’s broader infrastructure by lowering the barrier for creating and managing decentralized websites (dwebsites) on the Ethereum network, particularly through ENS (Ethereum Name Service) domains. Its work complements core protocol and client developments by helping drive adoption and enhancing user experience in the decentralized web. Here are some specific examples and metrics illustrating its contribution:\n\t1.\tSimplifying Decentralized Website Creation:\nWebHash is a no‑code platform that enables ENS domain owners to easily build and customize websites without needing to write any code. By providing a user-friendly interface with pre-designed blocks and customizable templates (tokenized as ERC‑1155 NFTs), WebHash transforms what was once a technical barrier into a streamlined process. This helps expand the practical use of ENS domains, moving them beyond just being names into full-fledged digital identities and content hubs.\n\t2.\tEnhancing Decentralized Identity and Content Hosting:\nWith over 800,000 unique ENS participants yet only around 22,500 active dwebsites, there is a significant gap in the ecosystem. WebHash targets this gap by encouraging and enabling more users to deploy their own dwebsites, thereby reinforcing the decentralized nature of the web. For instance, according to their project updates, they have already achieved:\n\t•\tOver 4,100 user signups.\n\t•\tMore than 6,000 decentralized “link‑in‑bio” websites created.\n\t•\tApproximately 400GB of data stored on IPFS via their platform.\nThese numbers indicate growing engagement and real usage that, in turn, drives further decentralization and resilience in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\t3.\tImproving Decentralized Infrastructure Components:\nWebHash also builds a “Hash Dweb Gateway” that enables .eth domains to be resolved directly in browsers without relying on centralized gateways. This improves the overall security and censorship resistance of decentralized websites. By addressing issues like digital decay (where a significant percentage of traditional web pages vanish over time) and by offering a decentralized hosting solution, WebHash reinforces one of Ethereum’s key value propositions—resilient, permanent, and censorship-resistant content hosting.",

      "description": "**What are we to build on ENS:**\nWebHash.com is a platform enhancing ENS domain utility by enabling easy creation of engaging dwebsites, contributing to wider ENS adoption and user engagement.\n\nThe Problem:\n\nDigital Decay: 38% of all web pages that existed in 2013 are no longer accessible due to server failures, hosting expiration, or content restrictions, leading to the loss of valuable information and digital assets. Centralized hosting models are vulnerable to outages, censorship, and limited longevity.\n\nWe are on a mission to unlock the full potential of ENS domains. Currently, with 800K unique participants holding ENS names, only 22,500 of them have active dwebsites. which points to the challenges users face in deploying and designing their dwebsites. Our approach is focused on transforming ENS domains into foundational building blocks for decentralised identities (DIDs), where each domain is connected to a content hash, revealing a unique digital persona.\n\nOver the past year, our focus has been the simplification of 'link-in-bio' pages, making it possible for users to connect their ENS domains with personalised and informative dwebsite that serves as a central hub for their decentralised identity (DID). Building upon this foundation, we are expanding our scope to include comprehensive blogging tools, static sites and customizable templates.\n\nKey Features:\n\nTokenized Website Template Marketplace: We have tokenized website templates as ERC-1155 NFTs, offering ready-to-use, customizable foundations for portfolios, blogs, services, and more. Simply mint and build. Despite the $1.5 billion website template market and over 50% of websites on the internet being built with templates, Web3 has largely overlooked their tokenization potential.\n\nReady-to-Use Blocks: Explore a range of pre-designed blocks and integrations on WebHash that make building websites fast and easy, no coding needed. Choose, customize, and create your website with just a few clicks.\n\nHash Dweb Gateway for ENS Websites: Chrome does not resolve .eth domains. While projects like .limo offer a workaround, they introduce potential vulnerabilities tied to centralized infrastructure. The Hash Gateway enables seamless resolution of .eth domains without relying on any centralized gateway, allowing users to experience the decentralized web as it was intended. secure, censorship-resistant, and truly decentralized. https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hash-decentralized-gatewa/mjjndfhdgdafdonmmpbmddiginkbclmi?hl=en\n\n\n \n  We have conducted Three buildathons to motivate ENS holders to create decentralized websites (dWebsites) for .eth domains, distributing prizes totaling around $3200 among the competition winners. More buildations are coming soon.\n\n\n**Stats**\nWe’ve achieved notable success with over 4100 user signups and the creation of more than 6000 decentralised ‘link-in-bio’ websites with 400GB IPFS decentralised storage utilisation.\n\n \nRoadmap:\n\nToken gated websites.\n\nAI content moderation.\n\nNew block integrations:\n\nFarcaster Block: Enables the integration of Farcaster feeds into the website, allowing users to display their Farcaster social media content.\n\nLens Block: Facilitates the addition of Lens platform feeds to Website, offering a seamless way to showcase social interactions.\n\nPOAP Block: Allows for the display of POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) collections on the Website, highlighting user participation and achievements.\n\nOther integrations in the pipeline: Guilds, Mirror, DAO memberships,Snapshot, Badges and Scores.\n\n\n\n**Achievements:**\n\n1. No-Code Interface: We've created a no-code, user-friendly interface that makes building dwebsites accessible to everyone, regardless of technical expertise.\n\n2. Versatile Content Creation & Integration: Our platform at WebHash enriches the ENS domain experience by enabling users to create a broad spectrum of content types with seamless integrations. We have designed a user-friendly interface that allows for the addition of various standard elements such as avatars with diverse styles, engaging headings, informative paragraphs, and external links, all of which enhance the user's webpage. The integration capabilities of our platform include a suite of options that cater to different media types and functionalities:\n\n* Social Media Integration: Users can showcase their social presence with icons linked to their profiles on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and more, fostering engagement directly from their ENS dwebsite.\n* Multimedia Content: Embedding capabilities for platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, Twitch, Spotify, and SoundCloud allow users to share a wide range of audiovisual content, from music tracks and podcasts to videos and livestreams.\n* Interactive Features: Inclusion of interactive elements such as image sliders, RSS feeds, countdown widgets, and forms elevates the user experience by engaging visitors with dynamic content.\n* Content Distribution: Our platform supports file sharing directly from the page, whether it’s audio files, PDF documents, or any downloadable content, making it a versatile tool for content distribution.\n* Communication and Sharing: Integration of communication tools like Discord servers and call-to-action prompts encourages community building and interaction. Additionally, our VCard feature enables users to share contact information in a professional manner.\n* Monetization: We've integrated payment solutions like PayPal, enabling users to collect payments for products, services, or donations directly through their ENS dwebsite.\n* Customization: Advanced customization with custom HTML/CSS/JS and Markdown formatting allows for unique content creation.\n* Credibility and Engagement: By adding customer reviews and FAQs, users can build credibility and provide valuable information to their audience.\n\nThe combination of these features on the WebHash platform not only empowers users to create comprehensive 'link-in-bio' pages but also extends to more complex dwebsite formats such as blogs, portfolios, and business landing pages. Each feature is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, ensuring that even those with no coding skills can build a professional and aesthetically pleasing online presence on the decentralised web.\n\n\n\n",
