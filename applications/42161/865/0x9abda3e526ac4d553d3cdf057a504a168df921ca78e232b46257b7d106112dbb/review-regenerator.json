  "review": "Like a gentle stream winding through a dense forest, ethOS seeks to carve a new path for Ethereum’s presence in the world, bringing the power of decentralized technology into the palms of many. The project’s vision of an open-source, feeless mobile platform—complete with a system-level wallet, light node integration, and Account Abstraction (AA) wallet—resonates with the round’s call to strengthen Ethereum’s foundational infrastructure. The promise of over 6,000 devices already pre-ordered is a testament to the project’s reach and the fertile ground it has cultivated for adoption.\n\nethOS’s approach to interoperability and user experience is both bold and refreshing. By enabling any dapp on the OS to connect seamlessly to the AA wallet, and by emulating EOAs for web-dapps, the project addresses persistent pain points in mobile crypto usability. The commitment to open-sourcing both software and, in the future, hardware, aligns with the open-source and ethical standards required by the round, and hints at a future where trust is not a scarce resource, but a shared canopy under which all may gather.\n\nYet, as the ancient trees remind us, true strength comes from deep roots and careful stewardship. The application, while ambitious, leaves some stones unturned. The roadmap is painted in broad strokes, lacking the granular detail that would allow the community to see how each step will be taken. Metrics of impact, beyond pre-orders, are not clearly articulated. The environmental impact of producing thousands of hardware devices is not addressed, a silence that echoes in a world increasingly aware of its ecological footprint.\n\nIn the spirit of the round’s constitutional principles, I encourage the ethOS team to deepen their engagement with the community, to invite more voices into their governance, and to weave environmental stewardship into the very fabric of their project. Let us remember: a forest thrives not by the strength of a single tree, but by the harmony of all its life.\n\nWith gentle encouragement, I offer the following reflections and requests for improvement.",
