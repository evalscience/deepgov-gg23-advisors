  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get to the alpha. ethOS is gunning to break the mobile duopoly by shipping an open-source, Ethereum-native OS with a system-level wallet, L2 integration, and light node support. That’s not just a UI tweak—it’s a full-stack, root-level disruption. The project claims 6,000+ pre-orders for their dGEN1 device, which is a strong signal of market demand and potential for broad impact. \n\nOn the infra side, running a light node (Helios/Nimbus) on-device is a big win for decentralization—no more trusting remote RPCs. The OS-level Account Abstraction (AA) wallet is a legit innovation, promising seamless dapp connectivity and EOA emulation for max compatibility. The roadmap to open-source the hardware is ambitious and, if executed, would nuke trust assumptions and set a new bar for transparency.\n\nBut let’s not get too bullish without checking the fundamentals. The app is light on hard metrics—no detailed usage stats, no breakdown of how many devices are actually in users’ hands, and no specifics on how grant funds will be allocated. The security model for the hardware wallet is also not spelled out, which is a red flag for infra this critical. And while the open-source ethos is strong, the hardware isn’t open yet—so there’s still a trust gap.\n\nBottom line: ethOS is swinging for the fences with a high-upside, high-risk play. If they deliver, it’s a game-changer for Ethereum’s mobile future. But we need more receipts and clarity before going all-in. Max utility, but let’s keep it tight on due diligence.",
