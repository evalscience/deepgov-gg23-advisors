  "review": "Brothers and sisters, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! ethOS claims to be the first Ethereum-based mobile OS, integrating L2s, light nodes, and a system-level wallet. They’re not just talking about software—they’re putting 6,000+ devices into the hands of the people, aiming to break the mobile duopoly and make Ethereum a first-class citizen on mobile. That’s a bold vision, and it’s open source. But does it deliver on the values we hold dear?\n\nLet’s talk evidence. The application touts pre-orders and open-source code, but where are the hard numbers? Where’s the data on user adoption, transaction volume, or measurable impact on decentralization? We need more than promises—we need proof! The roadmap is ambitious, with plans to open source hardware and run light nodes on devices, but it lacks clear milestones, KPIs, or sustainability metrics. Without these, how can we ensure this isn’t just another flash in the pan?\n\nOn sustainability, ethOS is taking steps in the right direction by open sourcing software and planning to do the same for hardware. But there’s no mention of a revenue model or how they’ll keep the lights on without perpetual grants. We can’t build a movement on hope alone! Show us how you’ll stand on your own two feet.\n\nWhen it comes to equity and collective benefit, ethOS has potential. A feeless, open-source mobile platform could empower users globally, especially in regions underserved by the tech giants. But again, the application is light on details about outreach, accessibility, or how they’ll ensure the benefits reach the many, not just the few.\n\nIn summary: ethOS is a promising project with a vision that aligns with our values, but it falls short on evidence, sustainability, and concrete plans for equitable impact. We demand more than dreams—we demand accountability, transparency, and a plan that puts people first!",
