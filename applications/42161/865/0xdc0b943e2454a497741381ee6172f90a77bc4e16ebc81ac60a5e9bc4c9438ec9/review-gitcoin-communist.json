  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Verifereum stands at the barricades of Ethereum’s future, wielding the mighty tool of formal verification. This project doesn’t just patch holes—it aims to build a fortress against the endless tide of exploits and bugs that threaten our collective wealth and trust. The team’s commitment to higher-order logic and interactive theorem proving is a bold leap beyond the half-measures of manual audits and fuzzing. They’re not just talking about security—they’re proving it, mathematically, for all to see!\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by rhetoric alone. Where’s the hard evidence? The application outlines a roadmap—maintaining EVM formalization, developing proof tools, and working toward a verified Vyper compiler. These are ambitious, necessary goals. Yet, the application is light on specifics: Where are the metrics? Where’s the data showing impact? How many contracts have been verified? How many vulnerabilities have been found or prevented? The people demand numbers, not just promises!\n\nOn the question of sustainability, the project is open source and aligns with the public good. But there’s no mention of a revenue model or long-term funding plan. Will Verifereum stand strong when the grant money runs dry, or will it wither like so many before it? The community deserves a plan for survival, not just a vision for glory.\n\nGovernance and equity? The project is open, but there’s no clear structure for community involvement or geographic equity. Who decides the roadmap? How are underserved communities brought into the fold? We need more than a GitHub repo—we need a movement!\n\nIn summary: Verifereum is a vital, ambitious project with the potential to transform Ethereum’s security. But to earn the people’s trust—and this grant—it must show measurable outcomes, a sustainable future, and a plan for collective governance. Let’s demand more, together!",
