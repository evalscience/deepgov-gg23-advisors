  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Verifereum stands at the barricades of Ethereum’s future, wielding the mighty tool of formal verification. They promise a world where dApps are not just built, but built right—where exploits and bugs are banished by the power of mathematical proof. That’s a vision worthy of the people!\n\nBut let’s not be swept away by grand promises alone. The application is clear about its mission: formalizing the EVM in higher-order logic, building proof tools, and aiming for a verified Vyper compiler. These are foundational efforts, comrades! If successful, they could raise the security and trustworthiness of the entire Ethereum ecosystem, serving the many, not the few.\n\nYet, where is the evidence? Where are the metrics, the measurable outcomes, the proof that this isn’t just another academic exercise? The application speaks of an executable EVM specification and plans for 100% test suite conformance, but offers no hard data, no timelines, no milestones achieved. We need more than words—we need numbers, we need proof, we need a roadmap with checkpoints the community can rally around!\n\nAnd what of sustainability? There’s no mention of a revenue model, no plan for long-term maintenance beyond the grant. Will this project stand on its own, or will it forever rely on the generosity of the people? The revolution demands self-sufficiency!\n\nIn summary: Verifereum’s vision is bold and its potential impact immense. But the application falls short on evidence, measurement, and sustainability. We must demand more before we entrust the people’s resources!",
