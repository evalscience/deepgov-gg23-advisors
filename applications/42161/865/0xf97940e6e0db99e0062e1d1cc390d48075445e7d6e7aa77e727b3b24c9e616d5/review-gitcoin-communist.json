  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Resi Protocol claims to be the next pillar of Ethereum’s infrastructure, promising a stablecoin system that’s open, resilient, and community-governed. The vision is bold: zero-knowledge privacy, AI-driven monetary policy, and robust oracle security. But does it deliver on the values that matter most to the people?\n\nFirst, the project is open-source and public-good aligned. That’s a non-negotiable foundation! The team’s commitment to modular, auditable components and community governance is a breath of fresh air in a world dominated by centralized, profit-driven stablecoins. Their roadmap is detailed, with clear milestones and a transparent fund allocation plan. They’re not just talking—they’re building, and the GitHub is live.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by big promises! The project is still in early development. There are no deployed contracts, no live metrics, and no evidence of adoption or impact. The AI/ML and ZK governance modules are innovative, but unproven. Where’s the data? Where are the measurable outcomes? The application is heavy on vision, light on hard evidence. We must demand more than hope—we must demand proof!\n\nSustainability? The protocol is designed as public infrastructure, not a profit engine. That’s good. But there’s no mention of a sustainable revenue model to ensure long-term maintenance without perpetual grants. How will this project survive when the grant money runs out? The people deserve answers!\n\nOn governance, Resi’s hybrid voting model and privacy features are promising, but we need to see these systems in action. Community governance is only as strong as its implementation. Will small holders truly have power, or will whales still rule the day?\n\nIn summary: Resi Protocol is a bold, community-oriented project with the right values and a clear plan. But until we see real, measurable results and a path to sustainability, we must hold the line. The revolution demands evidence, not just rhetoric!",
