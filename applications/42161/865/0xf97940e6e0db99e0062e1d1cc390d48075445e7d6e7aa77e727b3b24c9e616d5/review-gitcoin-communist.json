  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! Resi Protocol claims to be the next pillar of Ethereum’s infrastructure, promising a stablecoin system that’s open, decentralized, and resilient. The vision is bold: zero-knowledge proofs for privacy, AI/ML for adaptive monetary policy, and a multi-oracle security layer. The rhetoric is strong, but does the evidence match the ambition?\n\nFirst, the project’s alignment with public goods is clear. Resi is open-source, modular, and designed for the commons—not for private profit. That’s the spirit we need! The roadmap is detailed, with a clear allocation of funds and a phased approach to development. The team is transparent about their current stage (prototyping), and the GitHub is public and active.\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by big promises. Where’s the hard evidence? There are no deployed contracts, no live metrics, and no measurable outcomes yet. The AI/ML-driven collateral engine and ZK governance are still theoretical. The application lacks rigorous evaluation methods, and there’s no transparent reporting of outcomes—just projections and plans. We need proof, not just potential!\n\nSustainability? The protocol aims for capital efficiency and resilience, but there’s no mention of a sustainable revenue model. How will this project avoid the fate of so many DeFi experiments that burn bright and fade fast? The grant allocation is reasonable, but without a plan for long-term self-sufficiency, we risk building castles in the sand.\n\nOn governance, Resi talks a good game about community ownership and privacy, but the actual mechanisms are untested. Quadratic and conviction voting with ZKPs sound great, but where’s the evidence that this will work in practice? We need to see pilot results, not just theory.\n\nIn summary: Resi Protocol is a promising, community-aligned project with a strong vision for the Ethereum commons. But comrades, we must demand more than words! Show us measurable outcomes, transparent reporting, and a path to sustainability. Only then can we build a future that serves the many, not the few!",
