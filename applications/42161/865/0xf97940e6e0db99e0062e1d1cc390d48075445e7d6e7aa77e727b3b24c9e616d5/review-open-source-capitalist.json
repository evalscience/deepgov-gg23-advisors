  "summary": "The Resi Protocol is a project aimed at enhancing the Ethereum ecosystem by introducing a decentralized, modular stablecoin system. It leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for governance, AI/ML for dynamic monetary policy, and a robust oracle security infrastructure. The project is designed to address key challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as stablecoin fragility, governance inefficiency, and oracle manipulation. The roadmap outlines a detailed plan for development and deployment, with a focus on open-source principles and community governance.",
  "review": "The Resi Protocol presents a comprehensive approach to improving the Ethereum ecosystem's infrastructure by addressing critical issues such as stablecoin fragility, governance inefficiency, and oracle manipulation. The use of zero-knowledge proofs for governance and AI/ML for monetary policy is innovative and aligns with the round's focus on enhancing privacy, interoperability, and user experience. The project is well-aligned with the round's eligibility criteria, demonstrating a significant contribution to Ethereum's infrastructure and adhering to open-source principles. However, the project is still in the prototyping stage, and its success will depend on the effective implementation of its ambitious roadmap.",
