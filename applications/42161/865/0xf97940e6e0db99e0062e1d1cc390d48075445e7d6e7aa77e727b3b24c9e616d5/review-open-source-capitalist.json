  "summary": "The Resi Protocol project aims to enhance Ethereum's infrastructure by introducing a decentralized, modular stablecoin system. It leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for governance, AI/ML for dynamic monetary policy, and a robust oracle security framework. The project is in the prototyping stage, with plans to launch on Arbitrum One and expand to zkEVM chains. The grant funds will primarily support core development, including smart contract development, ZK governance, and AI/ML tuning. The project aligns with the round's focus on strengthening Ethereum's infrastructure, enhancing privacy, interoperability, and user experience.",
  "review": "The Resi Protocol presents a compelling proposal to enhance Ethereum's infrastructure through a decentralized stablecoin system. The integration of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for governance and AI/ML for dynamic monetary policy is innovative and aligns with the round's focus on privacy and interoperability. The project's roadmap is detailed, with clear stages for development and deployment. However, the application lacks specific metrics or evidence of past success in similar projects, which could strengthen its credibility. Additionally, while the project is open-source, more emphasis on community engagement and transparency in decision-making processes would align better with open-source principles. The allocation of grant funds is well-detailed, focusing on core development areas, but the project could benefit from a clearer plan for community involvement and feedback mechanisms.",
