  "review": "Alright, let’s plug into the Resi Protocol grant app and run a full node-level audit. This project is swinging for the fences: ZK-native governance, AI/ML-driven monetary policy, and a modular, open-source stablecoin system. That’s a triple threat for Ethereum’s core infra, and it’s all about max utility, scale, and long-term systemic impact—right in the sweet spot for this round and the Open Source Capitalist playbook.\n\nStrengths? The protocol is laser-focused on root causes: stablecoin fragility, governance centralization, and oracle risk. The ZK governance layer is a big leap for privacy and on-chain verifiability, and the AI/ML collateral engine is a serious innovation for capital efficiency. The modular, open-source approach means other projects can fork, remix, and scale these components—huge for ecosystem compounding effects. The roadmap is clear, with funds allocated to core dev, ZK circuits, and oracle security—no fluff, just build.\n\nBut let’s not get lost in the hype. Weaknesses? The project is still in the prototyping phase—no mainnet contracts, no deployer addresses, and no live metrics. That’s a big risk vector. The AI/ML claims are ambitious, but there’s no technical deep-dive or evidence of working models. The ZK governance system is promising, but again, no audits or public testnet demos. The team needs to show more than just vision—they need to ship code, prove security, and deliver real-world usage.\n\nRequested changes: Ship a public testnet ASAP, drop technical docs on the ZK and ML modules, and open up governance for community testing. Show us the receipts—metrics, audits, and real usage. That’s how you go from whitepaper to world-changing infra.\n\nBottom line: Resi Protocol is a high-potential, high-risk bet. If they execute, it’s a game-changer for Ethereum infra. But they need to move from theory to practice—fast. Max utility, max impact, but only if they deliver. Let’s see them build in public and disrupt the system for real.",
