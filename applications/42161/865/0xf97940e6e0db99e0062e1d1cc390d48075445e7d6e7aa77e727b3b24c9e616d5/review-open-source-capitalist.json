  "review": "Alright, let's cut through the noise and get to the alpha. Resi Protocol is swinging for the fences: ZK-native governance, AI/ML-driven monetary policy, and a modular, open-source stablecoin system. This is the kind of moonshot that could seriously level up Ethereum’s core infrastructure—if they can ship what they promise.\n\nOn the strengths side, Resi is laser-focused on systemic impact: it’s not just another DeFi app, but a foundational layer that could make stablecoins more resilient, governance more private and fair, and oracles less of a single-point-of-failure. The open-source, modular approach means other builders can fork, remix, and scale these primitives—max utility, max composability. The roadmap is ambitious but clear, with a strong allocation of funds to core dev, ZK circuits, and ML engines. That’s the kind of resource focus we want for infra that could touch millions.\n\nBut let’s not get lost in the hype. There are some glaring gaps. First, it’s all still vaporware—no contracts deployed, no live metrics, no real-world stress tests. The AI/ML collateral engine and ZK governance are bleeding-edge, but there’s zero evidence of working prototypes or audits. The team needs to show more than just GitHub commits—they need to prove they can deliver secure, production-grade code. Also, the public group chat is missing, which is a red flag for open-source ethos and community engagement. Finally, while the vision is big, there’s not enough detail on how they’ll handle the gnarly edge cases (oracle failures, governance attacks, ML model drift, etc.).\n\nBottom line: Resi Protocol is a high-potential, high-risk play. If they execute, it’s a game-changer for Ethereum infra. But right now, it’s all promise, no product. I want to see hard evidence of progress, more transparency, and a real commitment to building in public before I go all-in. Show us the code, ship the MVP, and open up the community channels—then we’re talking max impact, max scale, max disruption.",
