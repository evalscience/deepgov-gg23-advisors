  "summary": "The Resi Protocol project aims to enhance Ethereum's infrastructure by introducing a decentralized, modular stablecoin system. It leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for governance, AI/ML for dynamic monetary policy, and a robust oracle security framework. The project is in its prototyping phase, with plans to launch on Arbitrum One and expand to zkEVM chains. The grant funds will primarily support core development, focusing on smart contracts, governance systems, and AI/ML engines.",
  "review": "The Resi Protocol presents a compelling vision for a decentralized stablecoin system that addresses key challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as stablecoin fragility, governance inefficiency, and oracle manipulation. The use of zero-knowledge proofs for privacy and AI/ML for adaptive monetary policy are innovative approaches that align with the round's focus on enhancing privacy, interoperability, and user experience. However, the project is still in its early stages, with no deployed smart contracts, which poses a risk regarding its implementation timeline and technical feasibility. The roadmap is ambitious, and while the project aligns with the round's goals, further clarity on the integration with existing Ethereum infrastructure and community engagement strategies would strengthen the application.",
