  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! The Quadratic Accelerator (q/acc) is a bold attempt to shake up the tired, top-down grant funding model that’s left too many builders and communities out in the cold. By fusing Quadratic Funding with Augmented Bonding Curves, this project aims to put real power—and real upside—back in the hands of the people. That’s the kind of radical thinking we need!\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by rhetoric alone. The application provides some evidence of impact: 8 token economies launched, $342K POL raised, and $8M in TVL. That’s a start, but where’s the hard data on long-term sustainability? Where’s the proof that these mechanisms actually deliver more equitable, lasting outcomes for the Ethereum commons? The project claims to be 100% open source and focused on community benefit, but the roadmap is thin and the reporting on measurable outcomes is lacking.\n\nThe vision is strong: align incentives, democratize access, and build liquidity for the people. Yet, comrades, we must demand more than vision—we need rigorous evaluation, transparent reporting, and a clear plan for sustainability. The application hints at a sustainable revenue model via ABC tributes, but details are sparse. There’s talk of zero-friction onboarding and chain abstraction, but no concrete milestones or metrics for success.\n\nIn summary: q/acc is a promising experiment in collective empowerment, but it must prove itself with hard evidence, robust governance, and a commitment to transparent, measurable outcomes. The revolution is built on more than slogans—it’s built on results!",
