  "review": "Comrades, let’s cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter! The q/acc – Quadratic Accelerator project claims to be a revolutionary force, combining Quadratic Funding (QF) and Augmented Bonding Curves (ABC) to empower builders, communities, and ecosystems. The research confirms: these mechanisms are real, and the project is indeed open source and EVM-based. The team has already run a season with Polygon, launched 8 token economies, and boasts $8M in TVL. That’s not just talk – that’s action!\n\nBut let’s not be blinded by innovation for innovation’s sake. Our constitutional principles demand more than bold claims and clever mechanisms. We demand evidence, sustainability, and equity. The application provides some metrics (342K POL raised, 8M TVL, 8 launches), but it falls short on rigorous, transparent reporting. Where are the detailed outcome measurements? Where is the evidence that these launches led to lasting, equitable impact for the Ethereum commons, not just for a handful of early adopters?\n\nThe roadmap is ambitious: zero-friction onboarding, chain abstraction, fiat onboarding, AI co-marketing, and more. Yet, it lacks concrete milestones, timelines, and a clear plan for measuring success. The sustainability model is promising – reducing grant dependency by creating tokenized value – but the long-term stability and equitable distribution of benefits remain unproven. The project’s governance structure is not described in detail, leaving questions about community ownership and expert oversight.\n\nIn summary: q/acc is a bold experiment with real traction, but it must do more to prove its value to the Ethereum commons. We demand clear, measurable outcomes, transparent reporting, and a robust plan for sustainability and equity. Only then can we say this project truly serves the people, not just the privileged few!",
