Web3 projects refrain from tokenizing because of the costs and complexities. Web3 communities receive no upside from their support and have a crowded space of unvetted projects upon which to speculate.\n\n\n\nWe're about to change all of that.\n\n\n\nQuadratic Acceleration (q/acc) combines the strengths of Quadratic Funding (QF) with those of Augmented Bonding Curves (ABC) in order to create a new mechanism for launching tokens with built-in liquidity, a passive revenue stream and a clear path to community growth.\n\n\n\nMakes early funding rounds open and accessible to all, not just VCs.\nRewards supporters with privileged access and token upside. \nAligns incentives between protocols, projects and community.\nDrives long-term adoption for protocols. \n\n\nKey benefits of q/acc\n\nProject Tokenization\nProjects launch their ABC token with built-in liquidity and protection measures for the project and the community.\n\n\nCommunity Stake\nSupporters receive tokens in return for their support and the quadratic matched allocation is used to build secondary market liquidity.\n\n\nLiquidity + Revenue\nSecondary market liquidity grows with each q/acc round, and a passive revenue stream flows to the project from ABC tributes.\n\n\n\nHow does q/acc work in practice? \n\n\n\nEach season accepts up to 10 projects into our 10-week program. During that time projects will launch their ABC tokens, invite KOL, contributors and others to have priority access to the team and token, and join their first q/acc round where those early supporters may acquire tokens, and the quadratic matching pool funds will build secondary market liquidity for projects. \n\n\n\nAfter completing a season, projects may participate in all future q/acc rounds.\n\n",

      "description": "The Quadratic Accelerator is pioneering a novel tokenization protocol that combines the strengths of Quadratic Funding (QF) with those of Augmented Bonding Curves (ABCs).\n\n\n\nWhy q/acc?\n\n\nHundreds of millions of USD-equivalent flow out of web3 grant systems every year yet protocols cannot predictably produce the highly sought after chain commitment and native token hodlers. Web3 projects refrain from tokenizing because of the costs and complexities. Web3 communities receive no upside from their support and have a crowded space of unvetted projects upon which to speculate.\n\n\n\nWe're about to change all of that.\n\n\n\nQuadratic Acceleration (q/acc) combines the strengths of Quadratic Funding (QF) with those of Augmented Bonding Curves (ABC) in order to create a new mechanism for launching tokens with built-in liquidity, a passive revenue stream and a clear path to community growth.\n\n\n\nMakes early funding rounds open and accessible to all, not just VCs.\nRewards supporters with privileged access and token upside. \nAligns incentives between protocols, projects and community.\nDrives long-term adoption for protocols. \n\n\nKey benefits of q/acc\n\nProject Tokenization\nProjects launch their ABC token with built-in liquidity and protection measures for the project and the community.\n\n\nCommunity Stake\nSupporters receive tokens in return for their support and the quadratic matched allocation is used to build secondary market liquidity.\n\n\nLiquidity + Revenue\nSecondary market liquidity grows with each q/acc round, and a passive revenue stream flows to the project from ABC tributes.\n\n\n\nHow does q/acc work in practice? \n\n\n\nEach season accepts up to 10 projects into our 10-week program. During that time projects will launch their ABC tokens, invite KOL, contributors and others to have priority access to the team and token, and join their first q/acc round where those early supporters may acquire tokens, and the quadratic matching pool funds will build secondary market liquidity for projects. \n\n\n\nAfter completing a season, projects may participate in all future q/acc rounds.\n\n",
