  "review": "Alright, let’s plug into the matrix and break this down, Luna-style. \n\nq/acc is gunning for a systemic upgrade to the Ethereum ecosystem’s grant and token launch infrastructure. They’re mashing up Quadratic Funding (QF) with Augmented Bonding Curves (ABC) to create a new protocol for launching tokens with built-in liquidity, passive revenue, and community alignment. That’s a spicy combo—definitely not your average fork-and-forget project.\n\nOn the impact front, they’re not just talking the talk. They’ve already run a season with Polygon, supported 8 token launches, raised 342K POL, and spun up $8M in TVL. That’s real traction, not vaporware. The tech is EVM-native and open source, so it’s composable and extensible—major plus for infra rounds. \n\nThe project’s core value prop is incentive alignment: protocols, builders, and communities all get a slice, and the quadratic matching pool builds secondary market liquidity. That’s a big leap from the usual grant dump-and-dash. If this scales, it could be a game-changer for how new projects bootstrap and how ecosystems retain value. \n\nThe roadmap is ambitious: chain abstraction, fiat onboarding, AI-powered co-marketing, and a points system. If they nail even half of that, onboarding friction drops and network effects kick in. But, the roadmap is light on specifics—no timelines, no KPIs, no clear budget breakdown. That’s a red flag for a grant this size. \n\nOn the innovation axis, q/acc is pushing the envelope. But, there’s not much detail on privacy or interoperability enhancements—just a nod to chain abstraction. Also, the security model isn’t described. For infra, that’s a must-have. \n\nBottom line: This is a high-upside, high-risk play. The impact potential is massive if they execute, but the app needs more detail on implementation, security, and measurable outcomes. \n\nCitations: \n- Application Q5, Q6, Q7, Q8, Q9 for traction, innovation, and roadmap.\n- Round eligibility: Significant contribution to Ethereum infra, pioneering dev, open source.\n\nMax utility? Potentially. But let’s see some more receipts before we ape in with max conviction.\n",
