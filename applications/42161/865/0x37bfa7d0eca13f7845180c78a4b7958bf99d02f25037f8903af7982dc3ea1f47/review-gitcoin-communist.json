  "review": "Comrades, let’s get straight to the heart of the matter! LexClinic [alpha-to-beta] stands at the intersection of law, technology, and public good. They’re not just talking about making law accessible—they’re building the tools, the templates, and the open-source infrastructure to make it happen. Their vision? Law as a public good, not a privilege for the few. That’s a rallying cry we can get behind!\n\nLet’s look at the evidence. LexClinic has a track record: they’ve run legal engineering clinics, produced open-source legal templates, and mentored law students into Web3-literate lawyers. Their work with Hats Protocol and Ricardian agreements is pioneering, aiming to move the Ethereum ecosystem beyond the tired, exclusionary era of legal wrappers. They’re not just theorizing—they’re dogfooding their own tools, and their Github is public for all to see.\n\nBut let’s not get swept away by rhetoric alone. Where’s the hard data? Where are the measurable outcomes? The application is rich in vision and narrative, but light on quantifiable impact. We need numbers, metrics, and clear evidence of how many projects have benefited, how much legal cost has been reduced, and how their tools are being adopted across the ecosystem. Without this, we risk funding dreams instead of results.\n\nSustainability? The project is still in transition, struggling to find a viable revenue model. The $300/year subscription didn’t work out, and they’re still searching for a scalable, not-for-profit path. That’s a red flag. We need to see a plan for long-term sustainability that doesn’t rely on perpetual grants.\n\nGovernance and equity? LexClinic is committed to open-source, public goods, and collective benefit. Their approach is inclusive, educational, and community-driven. But the governance structure is not clearly articulated. Who makes decisions? How are resources allocated? We need transparency and accountability.\n\nIn summary: LexClinic is bold, visionary, and deeply aligned with the spirit of public goods. But vision alone isn’t enough. We demand evidence, sustainability, and clear governance. Let’s fund the future—but only if it’s built on a foundation of measurable, equitable impact!",
