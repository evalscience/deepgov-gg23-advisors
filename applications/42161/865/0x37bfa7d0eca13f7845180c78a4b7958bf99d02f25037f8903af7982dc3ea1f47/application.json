        "description": "\"Law for [Public] Good: The Software of Society, Revolutionized Ultrasound on Ethereum.\"\n\n# LexClinic [alpha-to-beta simmer]\n\n[Lex.Clinic](https://lex.clinic) is the one and only legal engineering FLOSS clinic.\n\nLearn about our cutting-edge FLOSS legal engineering work by watching our office hours at [youtube.com/@lexclinic](https://youtube.com/@lexclinic) and reading bestape's blog at [ape.mirror.xyz](https://ape.mirror.xyz).\n\nIn addition to the topics discussed in ape.mirror.xyz such as Ricardian Network Contracts with Hats Protocol and LLM-compilers with [Nani.ooo](https://nani.ooo) (kind of like MCP), the most important open source infra we're developing includes [ERC-7827](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7827-json-smart-contract-with-value-version-control/21865).\n\nWe are pushing ERC-7827 so much because we believe RPCs are Ethereum's path to crossing the developer chasm.\n\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GnY-mb1WIAAe6Bv?format=jpg&name=medium)\n\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GnY-ojwWsAAY13Y?format=jpg&name=medium)\n\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GnY-x-4WcAA_x6w?format=jpg&name=medium)\n\nWe are a sibling to the [Make.DIY](https://Make.DIY) Biohacking Lab. [Follow the Lab](https://x.com/make__diy) on X and [donate to it](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/projects/0x37bfa7d0eca13f7845180c78a4b7958bf99d02f25037f8903af7982dc3ea1f47) on Gitcoin! Having Make.DIY as a sibling is critical to our d/acc strategy, as Make.DIY is leading the charge in surgically embedded DePIN and smart city tokenization, so that FLOSS distributed wins over opaque monoculture during this critical AI fork in the road for mechatronics.\n\nWe also are a sibling to [DAO Coalition](https://www.daocoalition.org). [Donate to it](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/projects/0x2ec218d189a1726a1d19616640a0f6f8849db62d071d3bce43008b57859263a2) on Gitcoin!\n\n# What is Legal Engineering?\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gm5c2bLWsAEOm5C?format=jpg&name=large)\n\nLex.Clinic is a member of IX Group. At IX, we believe that the most important false scarcity to war against is legal scarcity.\n\nAchieving legal abundance is the point of smart contracts, the technology Ethereum depends on. It's arguably the point of the Internet too, because markup language is also a legal engineering invention.\n\nImagine a future where law becomes as abundant as transportation. Because law is a line item in all other industries -- which we think we only share that cost universality with energy and communication -- any deflation of legal costs will have substantial impact.\n\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ghs7ycQXAAEzmyj?format=jpg&name=medium)\n\nBeing somewhat poetic, the status quo \"middle-finger\" is law is 169% more expensive now than 15 years ago. Our chiral \"thumbs\" strategy envisions law 99% less expensive in 15 years from now!!!\n\n## Our Spicy Take\nLawyers used to grease the gears of society but, at some point, they flipped the script and degenerated into 'bureaucrats' who, like sawdust, expensively clogs of the gears of society.\n\nFor instance, lawfare and paternalistic unlicensed practice of law interpretations all too common in the modern profession clearly causes immense tortfeasor and scofflaw costs to all of society.\n\nWe intend to regenerate lawyering ethos through personal integrity and mechanization technologies that disintermediate (because 'decentralized' is a woowoo concept designed to keep us impractical and, as such, capturable). \n\nBecause of our expertise with Web3.AI, we are confident that we will achieve Our Spicy Vision.\n\nWe will wash out the sawdust, replacing it with grease once more.\n\n# The Past\n## Pre-GG22\nLexClinic alpha was a successful minimum viable potential-charity:\n\n1. We walked many new web3 projects through our $300 legal risk checklist and 2 hour legal information session based on the project's answers to the checklist:\n\n* This enabled these web3 projects to make informed decisions about their legal future. \n\n* It also taught law students how to properly interview projects about their legal needs and how to expand past not just thinking rationally about what the law means, which is taught in law schools, but also thinking creatively about how to ethically achieve the project's goals.\n\n* After going through the checklist, many projects progressed onto starting the 501(c)3 charity designation process with the *pro bono* support of one of the best law firms in our industry.\n\n2. We did some open source general legal research at low cost:\n\n* An obvious value-add since law students already spend quite a bit of their time doing legal research. The Clinic's research opportunities exposed them to key players in our industry as well as key concepts in our industry.\n\n3. Big picture: \n\n* We figured out how to further our core value that **law is a public good** but is in a tragedy of the commons that needs to be rejuvenated. \n\n* We will likely be considered an educational charity when we are ready to make the request during our transition to beta, while also doing actual applied work that has a big prosocial impact on prosocial impact projects.\n\n4. Insights:\n\n* After speaking with and learning from our friends at Endaoment, we realized that the accounting requirements for 501(c)3 status are too advanced for our alpha stage, and that we needed an accountable managerial layer in order to meet 501(c)3 requirements.\n\n* Trade schools teach with journeyperson apprenticeships, and in many jurisdictions this is still how lawyers learn to practice law. We can take this applied learning methodology and use it to low-cost help prosocial impact projects in an environment where legal costs are often unethically high.\n\n* We do not offer any confidentiality, and all projects work together in the open. This helps ensure projects do not try, on purpose or accidentally, to get legal services at the Clinic.\n\n* We learned to use the Clinic itself for legal engineering experiments, so-called dogfooding, as a safe way to take on applied legal engineering work. For instance, our [Hats Tree](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/10/26) that is continuing to be built as we transition from alpha to beta.\n\nWe now have barred lawyers who graduated from LexClinic alpha! By being apprentices at the Clinic, they are Web3 literate lawyers.\n\n## GG22 Plans [ Now, Updates ]\nWe are now transitioning to LexClinic beta:\n\n[ update: still transitioning to beta ]\n\n1. We have the Ixian Tech law firm managing the Clinic, so that we can ensure projects do not detrimentally rely on students.\n\n* One of the problems we experienced during the alpha stage was that we should in no way interfere with student academic performance while also being responsible with projects.\n\n[ update: this is working welll ]\n\n2. The Clinic is now a $300/yr subscription or invite Patronage managed by Hats Protocol.\n\n* This makes onboarding simpler, and in theory should be easier to build out as a protocol so we can continue being as decentralized as is reasonable.\n\n[ update: this did not work out and we are rethinking how we can scale as a not-for-profit. until we figure that out, we are still staying in the alpha-to-beta transition ]\n\n3. Houses are deemphasized for now.\n\n* Critical mass was not big enough in the alpha stage to develop a 'surname legacy' culture, but we did successfully integrate existing projects as houses into the Clinic that wanted to use the Clinic's protocol for business logic, so we'll continue doing that.\n\n[ update: surnames are back because our TSU student is ambitious! ]\n\n4. We are going to administer the [inverted-precedent](https://github.com/lexclinic/Grants) legal engineering grant invention.\n\n* The Clinic's test pilots should be a good fit for properly testing this important rough consensus and wisdom cultivating over time concept.\n\n[ update: still waiting on enough funds for this, but now have a plan with RaidGuild [here](https://app.ethsign.xyz/share/4foav2uoblir) ]\n\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GgWJON9XoAA7tnW?format=jpg&name=medium)\n\n5. We are going to expand our open sourcing of Hats Protocol resources.\n\n* For instance, during this transition from alpha to beta, we have developed a mutual consent Hats system, including the [boilerplate](https://claim.hatsprotocol.xyz/10/26.5.1) legal that handles novel liabilities because of the Remote Procedure Call \"RPC\" nature of \"Ethereum Virtual Machine\" EVM systems.\n\n[ update: while we simmer, waiting for the capacity to scale up, this is what we've spent most of our office hours building, as explained above ]",

      "description": "\"Law for [Public] Good: The Software of Society, Revolutionized Ultrasound on Ethereum.\"\n\n# LexClinic [alpha-to-beta simmer]\n\n[Lex.Clinic](https://lex.clinic) is the one and only legal engineering FLOSS clinic.\n\nLearn about our cutting-edge FLOSS legal engineering work by watching our office hours at [youtube.com/@lexclinic](https://youtube.com/@lexclinic) and reading bestape's blog at [ape.mirror.xyz](https://ape.mirror.xyz).\n\nIn addition to the topics discussed in ape.mirror.xyz such as Ricardian Network Contracts with Hats Protocol and LLM-compilers with [Nani.ooo](https://nani.ooo) (kind of like MCP), the most important open source infra we're developing includes [ERC-7827](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7827-json-smart-contract-with-value-version-control/21865).\n\nWe are pushing ERC-7827 so much because we believe RPCs are Ethereum's path to crossing the developer chasm.\n\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GnY-mb1WIAAe6Bv?format=jpg&name=medium)\n\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GnY-ojwWsAAY13Y?format=jpg&name=medium)\n\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GnY-x-4WcAA_x6w?format=jpg&name=medium)\n\nWe are a sibling to the [Make.DIY](https://Make.DIY) Biohacking Lab.

Having Make.DIY as a sibling is critical to our d/acc strategy, as Make.DIY is leading the charge in surgically embedded DePIN and smart city tokenization, so that FLOSS distributed wins over opaque monoculture during this critical AI fork in the road for mechatronics.\n\nWe also are a sibling to [DAO Coalition](https://www.daocoalition.org).

At IX, we believe that the most important false scarcity to war against is legal scarcity.\n\nAchieving legal abundance is the point of smart contracts, the technology Ethereum depends on. It's arguably the point of the Internet too, because markup language is also a legal engineering invention.\n\nImagine a future where law becomes as abundant as transportation. Because law is a line item in all other industries -- which we think we only share that cost universality with energy and communication -- any deflation of legal costs will have substantial impact.\n\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ghs7ycQXAAEzmyj?format=jpg&name=medium)\n\nBeing somewhat poetic, the status quo \"middle-finger\" is law is 169% more expensive now than 15 years ago. Our chiral \"thumbs\" strategy envisions law 99% less expensive in 15 years from now!!!\n\n## Our Spicy Take\nLawyers used to grease the gears of society but, at some point, they flipped the script and degenerated into 'bureaucrats' who, like sawdust, expensively clogs of the gears of society.\n\nFor instance, lawfare and paternalistic unlicensed practice of law interpretations all too common in the modern profession clearly causes immense tortfeasor and scofflaw costs to all of society.\n\nWe intend to regenerate lawyering ethos through personal integrity and mechanization technologies that disintermediate (because 'decentralized' is a woowoo concept designed to keep us impractical and, as such, capturable). \n\nBecause of our expertise with Web3.AI, we are confident that we will achieve Our Spicy Vision.\n\nWe will wash out the sawdust, replacing it with grease once more.\n\n# The Past\n## Pre-GG22\nLexClinic alpha was a successful minimum viable potential-charity:\n\n1. We walked many new web3 projects through our $300 legal risk checklist and 2 hour legal information session based on the project's answers to the checklist:\n\n* This enabled these web3 projects to make informed decisions about their legal future. \n\n* It also taught law students how to properly interview projects about their legal needs and how to expand past not just thinking rationally about what the law means, which is taught in law schools, but also thinking creatively about how to ethically achieve the project's goals.\n\n* After going through the checklist, many projects progressed onto starting the 501(c)3 charity designation process with the *pro bono* support of one of the best law firms in our industry.\n\n2. We did some open source general legal research at low cost:\n\n* An obvious value-add since law students already spend quite a bit of their time doing legal research. The Clinic's research opportunities exposed them to key players in our industry as well as key concepts in our industry.\n\n3. Big picture: \n\n* We figured out how to further our core value that **law is a public good** but is in a tragedy of the commons that needs to be rejuvenated. \n\n* We will likely be considered an educational charity when we are ready to make the request during our transition to beta, while also doing actual applied work that has a big prosocial impact on prosocial impact projects.\n\n4. Insights:\n\n* After speaking with and learning from our friends at Endaoment, we realized that the accounting requirements for 501(c)3 status are too advanced for our alpha stage, and that we needed an accountable managerial layer in order to meet 501(c)3 requirements.\n\n* Trade schools teach with journeyperson apprenticeships, and in many jurisdictions this is still how lawyers learn to practice law. We can take this applied learning methodology and use it to low-cost help prosocial impact projects in an environment where legal costs are often unethically high.\n\n* We do not offer any confidentiality, and all projects work together in the open. This helps ensure projects do not try, on purpose or accidentally, to get legal services at the Clinic.\n\n* We learned to use the Clinic itself for legal engineering experiments, so-called dogfooding, as a safe way to take on applied legal engineering work. For instance, our [Hats Tree](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/10/26) that is continuing to be built as we transition from alpha to beta.\n\nWe now have barred lawyers who graduated from LexClinic alpha! By being apprentices at the Clinic, they are Web3 literate lawyers.\n\n## GG22 Plans [ Now, Updates ]\nWe are now transitioning to LexClinic beta:\n\n[ update: still transitioning to beta ]\n\n1. We have the Ixian Tech law firm managing the Clinic, so that we can ensure projects do not detrimentally rely on students.\n\n* One of the problems we experienced during the alpha stage was that we should in no way interfere with student academic performance while also being responsible with projects.\n\n[ update: this is working welll ]\n\n2. The Clinic is now a $300/yr subscription or invite Patronage managed by Hats Protocol.\n\n* This makes onboarding simpler, and in theory should be easier to build out as a protocol so we can continue being as decentralized as is reasonable.\n\n[ update: this did not work out and we are rethinking how we can scale as a not-for-profit. until we figure that out, we are still staying in the alpha-to-beta transition ]\n\n3. Houses are deemphasized for now.\n\n* Critical mass was not big enough in the alpha stage to develop a 'surname legacy' culture, but we did successfully integrate existing projects as houses into the Clinic that wanted to use the Clinic's protocol for business logic, so we'll continue doing that.\n\n[ update: surnames are back because our TSU student is ambitious! ]\n\n4. We are going to administer the [inverted-precedent](https://github.com/lexclinic/Grants) legal engineering grant invention.\n\n* The Clinic's test pilots should be a good fit for properly testing this important rough consensus and wisdom cultivating over time concept.\n\n[ update: still waiting on enough funds for this, but now have a plan with RaidGuild [here](https://app.ethsign.xyz/share/4foav2uoblir) ]\n\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GgWJON9XoAA7tnW?format=jpg&name=medium)\n\n5. We are going to expand our open sourcing of Hats Protocol resources.\n\n* For instance, during this transition from alpha to beta, we have developed a mutual consent Hats system, including the [boilerplate](https://claim.hatsprotocol.xyz/10/26.5.1) legal that handles novel liabilities because of the Remote Procedure Call \"RPC\" nature of \"Ethereum Virtual Machine\" EVM systems.\n\n[ update: while we simmer, waiting for the capacity to scale up, this is what we've spent most of our office hours building, as explained above ]",
