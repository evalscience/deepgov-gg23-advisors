  "review": "Alright, let’s cut through the legalese and get to the alpha: LexClinic is gunning to be the open-source legal engineering backbone for Ethereum. They’re not just talking about law as a public good—they’re building FLOSS legal templates, pioneering Ricardian contract patterns with Hats Protocol, and pushing ERC-7827 for value version control. That’s not just incremental; it’s a shot at systemic change in how legal infrastructure plugs into Web3.\n\nOn the impact front, LexClinic’s vision is big: slashing legal costs, onboarding law students into Web3, and open-sourcing legal know-how. That’s a multiplier effect—if they pull it off, it could lower barriers for thousands of projects, not just a handful. Their work on Ricardian agreements and legal templates is a direct hit on the root cause: legal bottlenecks that slow down innovation and scale. That’s max utility, not just patching symptoms.\n\nBut let’s not get lost in the sauce. The roadmap is a bit fuzzy—lots of talk about transitioning from alpha to beta, but not enough hard metrics or clear milestones. The operational plan is heavy on office hours and community engagement, but light on how the actual infra (like ERC-7827 or the Ricardian patterns) will be delivered, adopted, and measured for impact. There’s also a whiff of overextension: legal clinics, DAO tooling, network state experiments, and more. Focus is key if you want to scale.\n\nOn the innovation axis, they’re definitely not playing it safe. Chaining Ricardian agreements, experimenting with legal engineering in public, and building out new legal primitives for DAOs is bleeding-edge. But the application needs to show more on how these innovations will be productized and adopted at scale—right now, it’s a bit too meta and not enough concrete.\n\nBottom line: LexClinic is swinging for the fences on systemic legal infra for Ethereum. The vision is high-impact and aligns with the round’s focus on foundational infrastructure. But to unlock max funding, they need to tighten up the execution plan, show clearer metrics, and focus on scalable deliverables. Less philosophy, more product. Build in public, but ship in public too!",
